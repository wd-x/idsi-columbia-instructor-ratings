DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH THIS PROFESSOR! You will regret it. She is one of the worst lecturers I have ever had, and her tests are super convoluted and difficult. I was excited to take this class and have been considering minoring in psychology, but this class was honestly really discouraging. The lectures are disjointed and unclear, and it's extremely difficult to do well on the tests, even if you really study for them. The class had an average of about 70% (sometimes lower) on each midterm, and we would spend the entire class after getting them back debating multiple choice questions that she wrote and somehow refused to hold herself accountable for when they confused the class. She would argue with students extensively over the right answers to the questions and would become visibly frustrated when she was asked more than once about a question that the students didn't understand. She also gave basically zero partial credit on her short answer questions, which were always these bizarrely difficult graphs that meant essentially nothing and somehow took up a huge part of each test. 
 I had to take this class to fulfill my lab requirement because it was the only option that fit my schedule, but honestly I would really avoid it if you possibly can--it's just really not worth it to let this teacher basically ruin a subject for you because she's bad at what she does and doesn't know how to write tests. The class is also based almost entirely on your test scores, so if you're not comfortable with that, I consider that another reason to try and avoid this class. Added bonus--she's the chair of the psychology department, so there's really no one to talk to about her ineffective teaching methods and you basically just have to suck it up. 
Long story short: spare yourself the trouble and the frustration of taking this class with Lisa Son. It's probably not worth it for you unless you have absolutely no other choice, as I did. 
Workload:
Very light, but unfortunately that doesn't mean the class is fair. It's a reading every few weeks and a response, and a ridiculous number of tests: 3 midterms (30% each and she drops the lowest of the 3) and a cumulative final exam worth 40%.

Total douche.  At all costs avoid taking class with this guy.  He weighs participation very high and makes it almost impossible to get a good participation grade without doing some sort of extra credit.  If you talk twice a class expect a C range participation grade.  He grades all assignments like an ass and wouldn't know good writing if it hit him in the dick.  Do yourself a favor and don't take class with a professor who degrades students because he's miserable with his life as a art phd.

Professor Neath is one of the best professors in the Department of Statistics. His explanations in class are very clear and he's very friendly. Even though the homework can be challenging, he actually walks through the problems in class and is also very helpful during office hours if you still don't understand.

I feel like Dr. Phillips deserved a more fair and honest review here.
She was a tough professor and Orgo was no easy subject, but she tried her best to make her objective clear and organized. She used PowerPoint at a minimal level, which I enjoyed because you truly engaged with the material while writing notes. She didn't curve but she gave us all the tools to be successful. She made herself available on every Friday to work with us on workshop problems. When you whined about you have plan on Fridays, have you thought about the professor who spent HER TIME out of class time to help you? If you did all her workshop problems (once, twice or as many times as needed) AND her Hunter past exams, you would be golden. They were very similar to her actual exams. You would quickly learn her testing style after one or two exams. The average for the first two midterms was at the 70s. You might not do well in a midterm, but you could drop one. Also, she allowed us to bring a 2-page (back and forth) CHEAT SHEETS for the final exam! You couldn't get better than that.
I took her both for Orgo I and Orgo II. If you put the work in, you would get the grade you deserve. The idea of not curving is so that your performance is YOURS, not depending on others. I think she made Workshop mandatory (like in recitation?) starting next semester. Go to those and trust me, you would learn a ton in 12 weeks.

Overall, I enjoyed this class.  We read 10 plays this semester plus a narrative poem and 60 sonnets, so it's very heavy reading.  There are 5 response papers due throughout the semester, approximately every other week.  A lot of people didn't put effort into them, but they are very helpful when prepping for the midterm and final, which is basically the same format. The final paper was supposed to be 8-9 pages, but Prof. Eisendrath cut it to 6-7 pages.  Professor Eisendrath was good at facilitating class discussion with a 60-person class in a 200+ people lecture hall, but she did not finish analyzing each play every week and we had to often rush through some aspects of the discussion to finish discussing every play by the end of the semester.  She also decided to switch the syllabus and read another play with less than 2 days' notice and postpone the other one for two months, which was irritating because I had already started reading the play.

I very seldom review professors since I don't usually have anything to say, but Brendan was an exception to the rule.
I think he's incredible.
He beats around the bush a lot and goes off topic, which is endearing and at times a bit annoying, but I think mostly he's just trying to make points about the material that fly over peoples' heads. Cocky kids who think they're geniuses come in with the mentality that they're going to learn how the economy works and make millions of dollars trading on Wall Street. They hate him because he doesn't deliver the goods they want so that they can study everything, commit it all to memory, and ace the test like they could do if it were a chemistry course, retaining all of this information like it's a fact of the matter.
The course is designed to try to make people understand that there is no fact of the matter. Economics is a tricky beast with very few real ""theories"" akin to what you would learn in a hard science class. In the problem sets and tests he forces you to think about these theories and more importantly what they really mean in practice. The problem sets force you to conceptualize them and understand what they mean, but more importantly that they could also not mean that thing at all if you think about it a certain way.
He makes a lot of self-deprecating humor and says that he doesn't understand this stuff; but this is the subtle way he implies to the class that he doesn't totally understand this stuff, they don't understand this stuff, and nobody really understands this stuff because it's always being falsified and reformulated as the economy changes.
It's painfully obvious to me why so many kids don't enjoy Brendan's class. It's a conflict between intellectuals like himself who like thinking about economics, and career-oriented people chasing success who just want to take the theories and go do something incredibly dangerous with them so they can make lots of money. He knows the kind of students he's dealing with, so instead of giving them what they want he tries to teach them what they need to know so he doesn't end up being implicated in the next Manhattan Project of economics.
Anyway, amazing professor. Extremely subtle but brilliant. Not for the Donald Trump types who want to go to Columbia and get a BS education in economics, but there's an incredible amount about economics that you can learn if you come in with an open mind and figure out what he's trying to tell you. He will never shove anything down your throat, and his point is often very different from what he says. Just like in the world of business where a huge chunk of his students end up. 
Most people hate him, I love him, so I guess I'm just an idiot and don't understand anything about economics.

Workload:
I am a math/philosophy major, and I had absolutely no problem with it. 6 psets, a midterm, and a final. If you're not particularly good with abstract ideas, however, then I would suggest not taking this class. I would also suggest not majoring in economics.

Yuan is an awful, awful teacher. He is super boring in class and people literally FELL ASLEEP and started snoring - while he was talking! Unlike what I've heard about other Python professors, Yuan doesn't really care about his students learning. He just comes to class and drones for two hours, and he does not take care to keep students engaged whatsoever. It's like he's just trying to fulfill a requirement. He may know the material, but the fact that he can't communicate any of it is testament to the fact that he is just a PhD student who should not be licensed to teach. 
The course itself is NOT a 1-credit course. Yuan gave way too much work and is not empathetic to students' needs. He doesn't seem to realize that people take more than his class.
He is organized, though - my recommendation is: don't go to class. I stopped going after the first few lectures; spare yourself the pain of sitting through his lecture. His notes comprehensive enough.

Professor Durgin is a mixed bag. He's very passionate about the subject of writing and will do everything in his power to help you succeed. If you go to his office hours he will talk you through your essay and ensure that you walk away with a good idea, usually like 5, (more importantly an idea he likes) that you can pursue. The ideas are also genuinely interesting and will make you see the relations between individuals, narrative, and world in a whole new light. That said, his style of writing is very humanities, gender studies,that iffy dimension of philosophy and thought. So if you're not into the kinda bsey nuances of aesthetics, representation, and language it's going to be a rough semester. On the other hand, if you can stick to a text and analyze the shit of what it means for someone to wear white glasses or how sounds can be reflected off of mirrors in the form of images, you're good. 
Little bit of advice. The way he keeps his grading consistent and feel not like bs is that he grades very harshly on how close you keep to the text and exhibit. So for all the progressions stick very close to the language and arguments of your exhibit don't insert your own narration and expand the scope of your text. Stay as specific as possible.  
So if you're looking for an easy Uwriting class this is not it.So SEAS kids stay out. If you're genuinely interested in the humanities and academia in a gender studies/philosphy field, I cannot reccomend anyone better than Dr. Durgin. 
Also he's generally a great guy.

Dr. Fay is an amazing professor! She truly cares for her students to improve in her advanced lab course. My grades were not exactly the highest in the beginning but they improved as the course progressed. The course consists of many advanced lab projects some of which replicate the Nobel Prize winning research! It is fantastic upper-level biology course to have. The course has relatively new techniques and the lecture component goes over new theory in leading research in the frontiers of chemistry. 
The Course
The TA was fantastic and he is very responsive via email as well as in office hours. The labs were graded harshly but very fairly. I find it most perplexing. So sticking to the course manual guidelines was critical. The take-home quizzes were challenging as you would be asked to read scientific literature and use it substantiate your claims/findings in the lab experiment. The in-class quizzes were difficult- perhaps the most challenging. This kind of made the difference between what grade you made the course if you were on the brink. The in-class quizzes wee basically a new experiment from a research article that related to the experiment we completed that week. You had to understand the context of the experiment and answer questions under a time limit. So without knowing the general concepts of the experiment and applying them would make the quiz all the more difficult. Although you may not get a good yield, but a yield is expected as this makes it all the more challenging to explain your data. I should also add that yield is not a criterion used for grading. The lab reports are strictly graded based on the rubric. 
Overall
The course was fantastic! I would probably do it again :) We learned so much more chemistry and I thought this was an invaluable experience whether you are going into PhD or MD or both.

Dr. Fernandez is a very engaging, funny, and passionate professor! The course is essentially a Physiology course based on excitable cells (only). The course is divided into two parts (1) the physiology of neurology, and (2) physiology of muscle. There is are few physics concepts that will continue to reappear. As well as some calculus in graphing. Don't get bogged down on the physics and math- it is never tested in the exams. However, a general understanding of the concepts and followed by applications of the concepts is critical to get a good grade. Without a developed understanding of what the researchers were aiming, you won't be able to to score on the midterm. The average of the midterm was like a 29/45 - again its hard. However, the curve is very forgiving and Dr. Fernandez really takes care of your grade in the end. Had scored the average on both exams (midterm and final) and received an A overall. 
Though the exams are difficult, the most challenging are the discussions. These discussions are graded. So every thursday you will have to be prepared to discuss on a paper that should have won or has won a noble prize according to Dr. Fernandez. I'm speaking of the last paper Dr. Fernandez (lol). So they go over the paper and ask questions, the more you speak up and answer the questions the more checks you get. The # of checks get put on a bell curve and you get your grades based on that. The overall grade is 30% midterm, 30% discussion, 40% final.  
Exams were challenging because they would essentially be a thought-problem and predicting the result in a graphical manner. So the best prep would be to ask question!

This was not the most interesting theoretical computer science course I have taken. Sure the material is very canonical: approximation algorithms for all of the standard problems, lower bounds, and reductions. However, it just did not hold my interest. The algorithms were all presented well, but they just were not that interesting. Perhaps part of the problem is I had seen most of the material before. But moreover, because each class we looked at new algorithms, it did not feel like the class was going anywhere, but rather starting over with a new problem each week.
Overall, not a bad class. Teaches you all the approximation algorithms you would want to know. Most of the material you would need to get started in the field of algorithms.

Vogel is a very smart man. His teaching style is very systemized in that he has a clear outline of what he wants to cover during any given lecture and he rarely gets sidetracked. Sometimes he speeds through certain concepts in lecture that you have to go over later on your own to understand fully.
His Econ class was very very very  math-heavy. Never on any midterm or final did we get a question about a purely economic question. The closest questions we would have that could be explained using words were those with SPNEs and whether or not a strategy was feasible. 
I would recommend this class to anyone who likes math.

I really enjoyed taking Art Hum with Wamsler. I was very worried because I had never taken an art class before and had no idea how to critique art // write a paper about art. I went to office hours before the first paper was due and she talked me through a bunch of topics I could write on. She also circulated a list of things to mention during our second paper which was a comparison of two paintings.
The annoying part about this class is that it was an 840 and you had to make trips to museums or other sculpture sites to write your papers. I think she could tell when someone lied about going to the museum but I respected her for it.
She is a very interesting woman. I found her very funny just because of her particularly awkward German humor, but she was also a very kind woman and the type of teacher who never tried to force her view on anyone. She would give you an opinion of her painting or her interpretation--especially with something like Jackson Pollock--but if you disagreed she was okay with it.
I would recommend this class to literally anyone and I hope to take another class with her later on even though art is not anywhere in my major or minor. She spends her summers in Italy so she really has seen most of these works in person and she knows what she is taking about. She has genuine intentions and really just wants her students to learn.

I was very impressed by how Bin Guo manages to smile and talk at the same time. However...
His lectures bear little difference from an audiobook of Rudin. He nearly always gives the same exposition and examples, and when Rudin reads ""Remark: [...]"" Bin Guo will say, ""Let me make a remark..."" I also noticed that many people took pictures of the board instead of taking notes, which meant that either he was going too fast or he was not terribly interesting. Re: the latter, I will grant that verifying that calculus works is not the most exciting subject matter in the world.
He is also not very helpful outside of class. I once asked him to explain why my proof on the midterm was incorrect, because all he wrote was ""?"", and all he had to say was, ""This part of your proof is OK. The rest is bad and not good

1. Very straight forward exams - no tricks
2. Problem set solutions are all available online/people have the old solutions 
3. One midterm, one final - no projects
Cons - 
1. Class is boring
2. Lecture slides are not posted beforehand, so it's hard to pay attention in class - you will find yourself scrambling to copy everything down instead of absorbing the material
3. Very, very slight curve in the class (but this means that the class average is already high, and this should say something about the exams - they aren't hard)
FAQ:
Do I need to go to class? No
Are the exams hard? No, not really. Very straight forward - just study old exams, problem set solutions, etc..
Is the class time consuming? It doesn't have to be if you just copy the problem set solutions for the homework. It only gets busy before the midterm and the final - just go hard then.

This class was challenging yet enjoyable. Thaddeus is very thorough, goes at a good pace, and manages to be quite entertaining. He is very clear and efficient in the proofs he gives and draws nice diagrams where appropriate. Where the material was more challenging, e.g. Galois theory, he slowed down to give lots of examples, which was helpful. 
He tries to encourage participation, which may or may not have been successful, and answers questions effectively, both in class and during office hours. In fact, if you knock on his door anytime, he will take the time to answer your question if it is not too long.
My only complaint is that in Algebra I we spent a bit too much time on introductory material (propositional logic, equivalence relations, elementary number theory) so that midterm 1 did not cover groups at all.
Nevertheless, probably the best professor to take Algebra with. Everyone in the class really liked him; a lot of us are going on to his Topology class next semester.
Workload:
Homework: 20%, 7-9 problems, sometimes with multiple parts, usually takes at least 1-2 afternoons of thinking, usually proving somewhat interesting results.

All in all, nontrivial but very reasonable.

You either love or hate Vincent, and I hate Vincent. He does things that people seem to find endearing, e.g. eat chalk, set the carpet on fire, imitate Trump, tell stories about his strange friends, jump around screaming... I find them irrelevant and distracting. He appears to treat class as a means of entertaining himself and perhaps us, with teaching French as a secondary goal. More problematically, he spends most of class speaking English or, worse, translating French into English, which defeats the purpose of a language class. We were allowed to speak English or mispronounce words in French with few corrections. There was no listening component in the tests either. Consequently, my written French improved somewhat over the semester, but my oral ability deteriorated considerably. The presentations at the end of the semester were insufficient in addressing this and an afterthought at best.
We covered 7 chapters of Sur le vif, meaning vocab at the start of the chapter and grammar at the back of the book. Otherwise, we barely touched the text. I did not find this to be substantially more than Elementary 2; too much time was spent on review. So, I don't know if I learnt all that much in this class.
He does grade and return things quickly, however.

A well-executed class. Tal Malkin is very clear, puts a lot of effort into teaching, and knows that mathematical maturity among her audience varies wildly. Thus, she gives intuition as well as rigor, followed by many examples. She likes to get people to participate in lecture by answering or asking questions. This can be either illuminating or frustrating, depending on said people in class.
For the most part, lectures followed Sipser quite closely, although she merely sketched many of the more involved proofs, e.g. for PCP. The material was interesting enough, and she tries to give some motivation or application. However, the complexity portion of the class was much too rushed: we skipped many proofs and handwaved everything else.
Recitation notes were regularly posted, and these were quite long and poorly LaTeXed but very thorough, so I can't complain.
Most everybody who takes this class has to, so I recommend taking her iteration of it.

Used this class to help study for the biochemistry on the MCAT, turns out Nam does not teach half of the material on the MCAT for biochem.

Studied for days (like the previous reviewer) and did not score higher because the tests and quizzes had absurdly specific content.

This is a class I would recommend to anyone who has any potential interest in medicine, global health, or an interest in how the global health system (or lack of) ties into politics and international relations. Overall it is an easy class and you could probably get away with a B by just going to the lectures and not taking notes. 
Personally I enjoyed this class A LOT! There were different guest lecturers every class (except for two or three where the professors gave lectures) which really showed how vast the field was, and while you don't really get to go that deep in each subject because of the short time frame for each, the lecturers are always glad to stay back a few minutes and have a discussion, and so are both professors. 
The TAs and professors are always willing to answer questions or meet outside of class and they really make an effort to get to know students and become more approachable.
The professors are both very knowledgeable and their work abroad is inspiring. It's a class that made me want to learn more about medicine and health and my place in it.

The quizzes before each class are annoying, but you can generally get away with typing in important parts of the question into *apple*F on the reading and it usually comes up right away.

The final is two questions taken from a set of eight that you are given beforehand. This is an easy A class that will really inspire you!

I took di Cerbo for Calc 1 (even writing the positive review on December 29, 2016!) and I know his style pretty well. As someone who has gone through two semesters of him now, I wanna say that he's a lot, lot, LOT better for Calc III than for Calc I. He is far more approachable, answers questions in a solid manner, finishes course material well, explains individual steps and example problems capably, and even cracks a joke every so often. That all being said, he is by no means a perfect professor - he sometimes (not frequently, but enough to be aggravating) makes arithmetic/algebraic errors in example problems, causing him to backtrack. And his midterms and final are once again very, very reasonable - they closely match the practice midterms and homework questions.

Alonso is a pretty good professor, all in all. She has relatively easy-to-understand powerpoint slides, and her Problem Sets directly correspond to her exams. Her Midterm is pretty easy, made up for by a challenging (noncumulative) final. She's definitely better at teaching the beginning parts of the course, as it's pretty simple material. She's also a fair grader with decent TA's - they all respond pretty frequently and grade pretty lightly. Her problem sets are optional, but there's no reason not to do them - they only help your grade. Irasema is nice enough to give you two options for how she grades you - either 40% midterm and 60% final, or 25% HW, 30% Midterm, and 45% Final. She gives you the higher grade amongst the two options. Also, about half of her midterm is based off problem set questions, some word for word, without even the numbers being changed. As for the final, she makes it harder by varying the problems based on problem set questions pretty heavily, and asks you to do some pretty complicated voodoo magic with her loss function question. But she's a quirky and fairly entertaining lecturer who explains complicated points fairly well, so I'll give her a pass. 
All in all, she's worse than what I've heard for Xavier, but she's decent nonetheless.

I'm pretty sure Queuniet didn't like me all too much. I forgot to turn in a vocab sheet quite in time, and she was pretty obviously miffed. 
That being said, I want to give her the highest possible recommendation! Sophie is a strong native speaker with an incredible vocabulary. She can call to memory random words, define them using only french, and still make it all interactive and fun. In a conversation class, you'd figure that there would be a lot of awkward silence, even from the professor, but it wasn't like that at all! She wasn't an overbearing, domineering professor that solely commanded the class. Nor was she a (pardon the French) laissez-faire professor, leaving it all to the students. Sophie was the excellent medium; she managed to steer conversations effortlessly from topic to topic, leaving all students satisfied. She brought in some french students to talk to, played ""Taboo"" with us, broadened our vocabulary immensely, and forced us to speak only in French. She was an excellently versatile professor, able to handle everything. 
That being said, she was by NO means an easy-A professor. If you struggle with vocab every so often like I do, she can be pretty brutal on quizzes. I haven't heard of any other Conv. Fr. teacher that gives quizzes yet. She also judges your presentations pretty harshly, but makes excellent criticism points. She wasn't an easy teacher, but if you really, really wanna improve your French, she's the professor to do it. 
The thing she did best was pronunciation - Sophie had a website that she would use to play little games to test our pronunciation. There were even some questions about it on our quizzes! My pronunciation was about a million times better at the end than it was at the beginning, and I'd considered myself fairly strong in that area. 
What a wonderful French teacher. To top it off, she brought us breakfast on the last day of class! Really cannot urge you enough: TAKE THIS DAMN CLASS.

This class was very interesting and Professor Gupta did a great and thorough job of teaching it. She is clearly an expert in the field and gave a lot of personal insight into each of the disorders we studied, which made them much easier to understand. She puts a high emphasis on attending lectures; if you come to every class you will do much better on the exams because most of the questions come directly from the lecture. My only complaint is that she speaks very fast so it can be difficult to take notes. I started the semester taking written notes and had to switch to a computer.

Maureen Chun was one of the worst teachers I have ever had. She was unapproachable and just not nice. She never smiled or seemed excited or happy or passionate about teaching our class. In a class of just 15 students, she should be able to make students comfortable and help the class to mold together but she really just made things uncomfortable. She was awkward and brought no interesting insight or excitement to the texts that we read. If you made an insightful comment in class, she would basically ignore what you said and move on with the conversation in the direction she wanted to take it. She would often refute, in a very demeaning and embarrassing manner, our ideas or comments in front of the class. 
When it comes to writing papers for her, she offers no constructive criticism. Just flat out criticism.
She will tell you everything she doesn't like, will not mention anything positive about your paper, and she will not offer you any advice on how to fix or improve what she does not like. She also presents her criticism in a very demeaning way and delegitimizes your ideas and perspectives just because she does not quite agree. Meetings with her about papers and topics are hell. I came out of meetings with her wanting to cry and feeling even more confused and lost. She offers no guidance and does not direct you in any helpful direction for your ideas. Often, I would come to her with a paper topic and she would manipulate my ideas to what she wanted my paper to be about and 2/3 times her idea was a dead end. She insults your ideas and disregards the effort you put into your draft. Writing papers was already tough for me but writing papers for her was even harder. I knew that no matter how much effort and analysis I put into that paper, she would not like it, even if it was exactly what she wanted me to write about. The most frustrating thing was that she did not make an effort to understand your thought process or your ideas. She was so set in stone with her own ideas and would not really entertain any ideas or topics contrary to her own. 
Also, she is not very good with giving extensions and is not very understanding. However, she will take all the time she needs to get back your graded 3-4 pg papers (as long as 6 weeks). So she wants her students to meet deadlines but she doesn't meet them herself.
After speaking with many other members of the class, both humanities and STEM majors, all seemed to agree with this criticism of her. 
Some of the readings in this class were interesting.... nothing too special. The class material and work load itself was very doable.
I would recommend that you avoid this teacher at all costs. She will really ruin your semester and you will not reap the benefits of a first year writing class like you should.

This review is based on Applied Financial Risk Management Course under IEOR department taken by Prof. Allan Malz. In plain words, he is the worst teacher I have come across in the whole IEOR department.  His teaching style is very boring. He keeps stuttering words but doesnt explain the basics at all. He just cant explain things. Though I would give it to him that he is quite knowledgeable. But its of no use if one cant express himself.
The worst part is the grading system. In this course, he had kept weightages as 70% assignments and 30% exams(15%+15%- mid+ final). This looks and sounds like very relaxing to many students because exam weightage is low. However, there is a big catch here. Assignments and exams are very easy, so, class mean ends to being very high with very low standard deviation. And then he grades on curve. So, even if you get 90+ score(out of 100), you might end up getting B- grade or so!!!  Yes, this sounds ridiculous but its true. In assignments, marks get cut on silly calculation mistakes only. Because conceptually, whatever he gives is so easy that no one could make mistake. 
In assignments, everyone collaborates, so there is no way to differentiate good students and poor students because assignments are 70%.
This might be a great course for people who are not so smart but can be sure not to make any silly errors in the assignment (coz its 70% weight). However, for smart people this is a bad course because you wont be challenged enough to learn more and your marks would be cut because you made some small counting error which affects the final VaR(risk managment concept) value in the 2nd decimal place.
In general, I would say that stay away from every course of this professor. Giving B grades for marks above 90+/100 is INSANITY. He could very well have given a tough paper to differentiate between good and poor students such that mean is lower with high standard deviation - but seems like he doesnt understand this concept.  
I sincerely wish that the professor reads this review so that he can improve himself.

Dr. Moya is a funny engaging professor. His course is basically a lecture based course where he goes over the powerpoints until the class time runs out. During his lectures he will have tangents that exemplify Latin American politics, social structure, and mainly culture (UNESCO world heritage sites). His lectures can be dry at the details/years/history- as a pre-med I found economics portion to be difficult to understand. He is very well receiving in office hours and clarifies many doubts you may have in the course.
That said, the TA I had Schwartz was hard. He does do his best to keep the discussions going but overall the TA was a very hard grader. So discussions are huge portion of this class (20%) and basically they go over readings for the week. Mind you that the readings are almost never tested on the exam- even if they are, they would be very broad concept to make sure you have done the reading. So, my only regret is that the discussion sections should have a review on the lectures covered that week/previous week. The TA grades the essays harsh- I mean literally the max he gave for the essays (25%) was an A- because he ""doesn't believe in As."" I don't know how he graded the discussion class in general but generally everyone did well in A-range.  
Now the elephant in the room. The multiple choice based midterm and final....... The midterm is (25%) and is 100 Multiple choice exam with a LOT of ""not/except"" questions. The multiple choice are designed such that you get most of them right upper 70s/100. However, you are under time crunch- and getting in the 80s needs a lot of preparation. The MC test a lot of general concepts and most are word-for-word from the powerpoint- in graphs/legends/bullet points. However, the ""which of the following not/except"" questions take time and they will determine your grade. The average was a 73. So he gave 7 pts to curve the midterm to 80. The final (30%) average was 80%. The final also had an essay as well - which he said 4/5 would be given and we write on one. But was generous enough to put all of the prompts and told us to write one. So he tends to make the average 80% for both midterm/final. The course average is curved I believe to a B. So getting an A is not difficult. You are not competing with your peers, because grades are predetermined - A (93%), A- (90%)... etc. But preparing for the multiple choice is really hard- I got an A- in the class and I memorized all the slides. Key details do get tested (not years but names of all revolutionary heroes etc) as well the tangents that are not in the powerpoint!! 
Overall the class is difficult and do NOT go into the class with the expectation I'm going to do the readings and not attend the lecture and get an A. I believe this is the reason why students get stuck in the B-range grades because the exams test material that he goes on tangents about. Bottom line come to class and take good notes! Lastly, he does offer extra credit and it is worth doing them because they are forum migration lectures from professors from renown universities. They are simply inspiring to say the least! Would I take this class again? Yes! The professor is phenomenal and the course will shake your predetermined suppositions about Latin America as a backward country!!

I am sad to say that Professor Stokes' class was terrible. Right off the bat, she told us that teaching was her second career and hinted that she was only teaching to kill time. She was non-stop bragging about her previous, prestigious career, and very frequently drifted off to talk about her personal life. 
She never gave us our essays or exams back, which means that she probably didn't even read our essays closely. How are we supposed to improve if we don't know what we did wrong?
She wrote on the chalk board in a very disorganized manner and so we kept on having to interrupt her to ask what something on the board said. She structured the semester into chapters, but the lectures were disorganized. She went back and forth on topics a lot.
She used Powerpoint only once in the entire semester, and changed slides so fast that we, once again, kept on having to interrupt her to ask her to slow down.
Her lack of skills with technology would have been endearing if she wasn't so downright mean and psychorigid. Every time a phone buzzed or a laptop made any noise, she would scold the student as if we were in a high school classroom.
All of these interruptions took away a big chunk of time from actually teaching psychology.
This is one of the rare cases that I have experienced where the professor's behavior actually got in the way of my ability to learn the subject that they were teaching.

Very poor teacher. I think people like him solely because he's funny. Classes are disorganized and have no relationship to the readings we do. He offers minimal guidance on how to write a philosophy paper and no guidance on what's on the tests. You get tested on everything he says in class, NOT what's in the reading, so the best strategy is to NOT do the readings but instead write down everything he says and memorize it in time for the final. Also write a rough draft of your essays in time to have them reviewed by the TAs before they're due. If you can choose between Adam Blazej and Jake McNulty as TAs I recommend Adam because he's an easier essay grader and he gives out study guides for the midterms (however these study guides don't include EVERYTHING that will appear on the midterm.) I only attended Jake's recitation and he's a much better teacher than Prof Morrison, though.

The other reviews are fairly critical of Gaifman in one of two contexts: teaching an introductory logic class with insufficient pity or teaching a more subjective class with insufficient structure. Perhaps he is not the right professor to take in those contexts; however, in an upper level formal logic (think mathematics) course like this, his style of instruction is a bit more palatable. Though he still struggled with pacing, he typed up well-structured notes for us. And his explanations and proofs were always thorough enough. Though he moved between levels of abstraction, for the more advanced audience, this was not a big issue. I enjoyed this class and learned from Gaifman.
In terms of material, we covered self-reference and fixed-points, Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, Peano's and Robinson's theories of arithmetic, computability and undecidability in these theories, the Rosser trick, Gödel's second incompleteness theorem, and a bit more on provability logic. Some of the topics require a lot of thought to understand even the theorem statements, though the proof techniques were always straightforward. Gaifman made a very nice presentation of the basic material, leading us into it in a very natural way. Instead of proving the theorems very formally, he provided good intuition about what we were doing. This totaled around 50 pages in his typed notes, and to me, it felt a bit light. We spent more time reviewing than I felt was needed, which might explain why the semester felt a little light.
This course definitely requires a very good grounding in first order logic. It is the second course in the math logic sequence, and understandably, people who did not take the first struggled. Though Gaifman never dives into the details of the FOL deductive system, I used it to complete the exercises.
I will not complain about Gaifman's personality. He called out students a bit more than most professors, though never maliciously. Coming from a mathematical background, I did not find him too abstract. He may struggle to explain the fine-grained details on occasion, but, at this level, the student should be able to do this for himself. Gaifman is easily reachable by telephone, and holds office hours regularly. He did not give a lot of feedback, leaving students in the dark about their potential grades.
Workload:
The only work in this class was exercises; some were assigned week-to-week, others comprised a take-home midterm and final. We were not required to do them all, but I managed to. Some of the exercises took more effort to parse than to solve, though I am not sure if that was due to how meta the topics are or a flaw in how they were posed. Some of the proofs and deductions were kind of tedious when done to a sufficient level of rigor, and others were amazingly insightful and only a few lines. Really a mixed bag.
I'm not sure exactly how the problems were graded, though I think I got the final grade I deserved. According to the syllabus, the grade is 10% participation, 20% exercises throughout the semester, and 70% exam. However, I never received grades for these individual components.

Note: Don't take symbolic logic unless a) you're really passionate about it b) you're good at math or c) you need to take it as a major requirement. It's definitely one of the harder philosophy classes.
Kind of boring professor. Reads off slides he cribbed from the textbook instead of teaching. Really funny though and your best option for symbolic logic because of how easy his class is. To do well in his class, you DON'T need to attend lectures (I attended only when we had a test) but if you don't go, you have to be disciplined enough to read and understand the slides on your own. In addition, you MUST do every homework thoroughly, even though they're optional. Also go to all the recitations and talk at least 4x in them because participation is 10% of the grade. I recommend Sebastien Rivat as a TA because he's a clear explainer; however, he has a fairly thick Swiss French accent so if you're not used to that go to Manuel Kaeppler instead.

Professor Phillips is a very polarizing figure. Most students agree she is a fantastic educator with a real passion for teaching, however, she also maintains very high standards for grade ranges. Unlike other orgo professors in the department, the average grade for her course is around a B-. That being said, it is not impossible to do well and she provides ample resources to prepare for exams. Her lectures are extremely clear and well organized making note taking easy. The exams themselves are very fair without questions completely out of left field. She is the type of professor that knows every student's name in a large lecture, and she seems to be invested in the success of each student while recognizing organic chemistry is a difficult subject. A semester with Professor Phillips made me love organic chemistry, and I recommend taking her section if you are interested in learning the subject material well.

This is a very well organized class with a reasonable and consistent workload. The course material provides a integrated and holistic way to view urban studies first understanding neighborhoods, then gentrification and finally environmental degradation. There is creative essay for each unit that are a refreshing approach. Passell provides A LOT of space for open discussion and wants us to engage with each other intellectually. However, it often times felt like he was using discussion to avoid giving a thorough, pre-planned lecture. The discussion often went in circles and led nowhere as a result. The participation grading system made it so everyone felt like they had to put in their two cents even if their answers were uninformed and badly crafted. Passell would entertain all claims, making the class feel impossibly long. Additionally, even though there was probably only around 30 students in the class, we barely received any feedback on our work or ideas. Grades were given with no comments. Despite the organized template of the class, everything else felt like it was kept to minimal effort. I would recommend this class only if you are truly enamored with sociology.

Of the two classes I've taken with O'Keeffe (one in French, one in English), I've found that they have a similar structure. You have 4 essays that will be your grade (despite what his syllabus says, with several more writing assignments than we ever actually do) and you basically get some reading for every class. Sometimes you read one or two books, but mostly it's texts that he scans for you (either literature texts or philosophy and academic discourse on the subject). It's clear the man knows a fair amount of what he's talking about, and that's basically what he shows you during the class. You essentially come to class and he talks for the entire period, with some engagement from the class. If it's a particularly exciting topic there may be more of a back-and-forth dialogue, but I've found that fairly reliably you can go to class and expect to be talked at for the entire time. I know that he says he gives mostly Bs, and that he reserves the As for good work, but I'm not entirely sure how true that is. I got A's in both classes that I took with him, even though I feel my writing in French is not really up to snuff. Regardless, it's not impossible to get an A. I will say it is near impossible to get an A+. I have gotten only a single A+ on an essay, and it was because I based an argument of mine on a Said essay that I had picked up in another class (Black Paris with Brent Edwards). I based a lot of my essays around Derrida, Levinas, Butler, Said, and Hegel (and if you mention hermeneutics and the hermeneutic circle you're golden), and if you stay within that milieu, you should be able to find something that he's going to like. He doesn't necessarily have to like the philosopher to give you a good grade (after all, he had Things to say about Said's Orientalism on my paper, but I still got the A+), but he will tend to find your argument more interesting/persuasive/engaging if you stay around that region of philosophy. His classes aren't incredibly difficult, and I tended to shirk the reading a lot because he goes over it very thoroughly in class. I used his courses to fulfill some of my Barnard 9 ways, and overall it wasn't such a difficult thing to do because his classes are fairly lax.

I've taken two of Anne's film classes (offered in the spring semesters) and they're with the French department so you need to know French to watch the films (they do have subtitles) and to understand every speaking, but you can write your essays in English if you're not a French major/minor. You can also do your midterm in English as well, if you want. The classes are about 2 hours long (it was always at 2:40pm, as well) and you generally watch a film and then discuss it for several days before watching another film. Anne is a nice professor and very laid back. There is relatively little for you to do in this class besides watch films, discuss what you just watched, and then watch more films. In one class she gave us a group project (which was running the discussion about the film that day) and in another class she gave us an open ended sort of essay that we wrote up as a grade besides just our midterm and the final paper. She is incredibly lax in what you can write about, and her midterms are open ended enough to include all the films you've seen up to that point. Midterm is 3 essay prompts, and you pick two. Generally doesn't take the entire class period, so you could be out a bit early. I used this class for some of my Barnard 9 ways, and also it was just a fun way to spend my time. Sometimes it was boring or hard to focus, but I think that was mostly due to the length of the class. I actually used some of the films in this class for papers in other classes of mine, so if you just happen to be taking a few lit/philosophy/french classes at the same time as this one, it may be useful for other courses.

Svetlana was extremely helpful from start to finish. I wish I would have 'found' her earlier in my Columbia. I also wish she taught more classes. One of her big strengths was her ability to design such an effective course  - shows so much about who she is. She really knew the theory (covered in the first half). She has an amazing perspective for experimental design (taught in the second half). She really knows how to help cultivate a scientist's mind in others (taught throughout - how to write a great paper, discuss your research, respond to reviewers, get/give feedback to peers., etc.). There is so much I could mention. 
All in all, A+ class: Lectures were clear and useful, readings were high value, we all got great feedback and support, Svetlana generated a lot of energy in the class, and excitement in the group.
Summary: she is just amazing. She is such a nice person, caring, and really interested in hearing the students thoughts. She is always there for help, and really has a passion for the topic. I couldn't have asked for a better professor.

Disclaimer: I got an A.
Sarah has a Master’s degree in teaching. She has a PhD in science education. She has a lot of ideas about how students learn effectively and how best to teach them. You know what else she has? No. Clue. How. To. Teach.
Instead of explaining the concepts behind the week’s experiment and giving an overview of the procedure in lecture, she tells you to watch lecture videos she posts on Canvas. Some of the videos were made by a previous teacher, and they’re not so bad. Some of them were made by Sarah herself, and they make absolutely no sense, because she cannot explain a concept to save her life.
Usually, I didn’t have time to watch the videos before class. Guess why? Because I needed to study for the quiz at the beginning of the lecture on the previous week’s experiment. That’s right. She wants us to learn new material before lecture, as we’re studying the old material for a quiz during lecture.
After the quiz, we get to lecture. Sarah does not explain anything about the concepts or procedure of the upcoming experiment, expecting that we’ve watched, understood, and memorized her videos. She immediately presents a practice problem or hands out a worksheet, and tells us to do the problems and then confer with our neighbors. Fine, right? Not if you have no clue what’s going on, because she didn’t bother explaining it.
Now, Sarah practically yells during class because she refuses to use a microphone. She talks as if she were supervising the teaching staff of a kindergarten, always explaining exactly why she is doing what she is. “Here, try these problems and then confer with your neighbors. Studies have shown that this is the best way for students to learn.” F*ck off with your ivory tower bullshit, Sarah. I learn best when I’m taught, not by being thrown in the deep end. At least when we’re done trying and failing to do these practice problems on our own, she’ll explain the solutions, right?
Wrong. You should’ve known better.
Often, Sarah will say she has the solution on the PowerPoint presentation and tell us to look at it at home, so that way we’ll be teaching it to ourselves and learning it better. If I’d wanted to do that, I’d have taken a cheap online course. Explain the goddam solution, Sarah. But it doesn’t matter anyway, because her explanations are usually clear as mud.
I’m not even going to mention how obsessed she is with her precious surveys and polls. Or, how anal she is when she supervises the actual lab. She’ll tell you off for pulling out your phone during a 20-minute wait period during an experiment.
To sum up, Sarah is not good. Joseph, on the other hand, is a darling. Carry on with your day.

I would like to preface this review by saying, I love Organic Chemistry, I think it's an awesome subject and that I did very well in all of my orgo lecture and lab classes. That is to say this review is not biased due to a bad grade. So...I personally thought Phillip's Orgo I class was a absolute disaster. I get that it was her first semester here and that she was likely adjusting but still, come on, it was terrible. First off, she refused to adjust to the McMurry textbook even though it was assigned so the readings never correlated to her lectures. She was always giving us mechanisms and reactions that weren't in the text book and that I could never find online. If you aren't a 100% awesome note taker, you're screwed...no where else to get the info. Second, her practice exams were not only unhelpful, they were a tremendous waste of time b/c they were from Hunter College (where different material was taught and in a different order, not to mention the exam format didn't match because our class length is shorter). I honestly spent more time trying to figure out which practice problems were relevant than I spent actually doing the problems. Third, her ""work sessions"" (2-3 hours long on Friday mornings, F** me) which she calls optional, ARE NOT OPTIONAL...there is no where else to get HW solutions. Although, even if you do go, you'll probably end up with a lot of wrong answers anyways because she didn't correct the answers when we went over then on the board...it's ridiculous. Like how are we supposed to learn??? WTF. Third, her exams are dumb, they seem easy when you're taking them but you will loose massive points for the most trivial things/the questions are straight up not clear. For example, I lost 12 points on her first exam because it said ""use resonance structures to explain your answer""...I did that...I showed all correct resonance forms...BUT APPARENTLY it was an essay question that required multiple paragraphs of written explanation...how were we supposed to know? Why not just write ""this is an essay question""? I can't tell you the number of times I lost points due to lack of clarity in the wording. And another time, one of her multiple choices had an answer option that was given in ""Chemistry as a Second Language"" (which I'm pretty sure was recommended as supplemental reading) so naturally I picked that answer...and had good reasoning for it as well (my TA agreed). It was marked wrong. When I asked her about it...guess what she said? She said ""You can't believe everything you read."" Are you kidding me, I can't believe what I read in a text book?????? She refused to give points back. 
Basically this class is set up in a way that you have to do everything/learn everything the way she wants you to do it, there's no room to learn in your own way. You have to go to lecture/take notes, you must go to her work sessions (which adds an additional 2-3 hours of sitting in a classroom on top of recitation and lecture), you probably should go to her office hours (which I couldn't do and made things harder). Reading the textbook is useless. If you're a busy person and like studying on your own schedule/in your own way...DO NOT TAKE PHILLIPS. If you're the kind of person who gains a lot from lecture and likes office hours...she might be a good option for you. I know some people like her. I personally think a great professor is one that supports you learning the material in whatever way is best/easiest for you, Phillips is not that. I took Doubleday second semester and loved it! He gives you so many resources to learn and basically lets you do it however works best for you...I learnt so much more from him. 
In response to the previous review, I don't think Phillips class is harder, it's just more frustrating. Averages are actually much lower for Doubleday. With Doubleday, when I did badly on an exam I knew it was my fault whereas with Phillips, I felt that it was due to a lack of resources/clarity and that my exam scores never accurately reflected my understanding of the material. Doing well with Phillips equals emulating her wording...spend time understanding her desires...not Orgo.

As much as you make it. A lot if you want to do well. Quizes and exams are all that count for your grade. To do well though, you really do need to go to all of her extra, so called optional, things...it's not fun. 
For HW, a 1 to 2 page worksheet (which she makes every week), she gives them out on Thursday and the work sessions are on Friday. You won't get far answering the questions on your own. They aren't graded but you need them to study. 
6 quizzes, for a total of 50 points. Super easy (but probably depends on your TA). Lowest score is dropped. 3 midterms, each worth 100 points, and a cumulative final worth 200 points (although heavy heavy emphasis on end of semester, didn't have any questions from the first few chapters). You get to drop one midterm or half of the final.

I think that Sev is a great teacher. He tries to connect with students on a personal level, albeit a large sized class. Work in this class is minimal, with my specific semester consisting of 4 short papers (4 pages, double spaced) and 1 term paper (10 pages, double spaced). Attendance to lecture is not required. Attendance to recitation is not required. if for whatever reason you cannot make it to either, Sev is very open and willing to work with you one-on-one for both class-related reasons or not. 
I highly recommend this course. Sev is interesting as a lecturer, has insightful things to say but also opens up the conversation and allows for students to make their own conclusions and discuss them in class as well as explore through papers. The readings assigned are of the lighter workload, not nearly as much as in classes like lit-Hum or CC. For the most part you can even get away without reading them before class. But it is necessary to read them at least in part, since they are to be used as references on the shorter papers. Sev even goes as far as to provide the readings as PDFs so that you don't need to pay for the whole book!

Do not, I repeat, DO NOT take Calc III with this teacher. Do whatever you can to switch into a different section. If you can't and you're stuck, well... best of luck.
I thought in the beginning of the semester that I'd cut Groman some slack because he's a recent grad student that was teaching the course for the first time... yeah well guess how long that lasted. He is hands down the worst mathematics teacher I've had here at Columbia. He cannot teach, he just can't. He stutters over his lackluster explanations, his handwriting is constantly confusing, and the little writing that could be understood in the chalk board isn't even visible because the man has a habit of standing in front of everything he actively writes. It didn't take long before I resorted to reading the textbook to learn the material because he just couldn't teach -- it remained like this throughout the entire semester. 
But as if his teaching wasn't horrible enough already, his exams were all substantially more difficult than any other section I knew about (Dobrovolska, De Silva, etc.). The average for the first and second midterm was a 55 and a 61, respectively. The final wasn't any easier either. And oh yeah, I almost forgot! His weekly hw assignments were also tediously long and more difficult. He made a habit of assigning 20+ problems every week, and a single problem could take over an entire page to complete. Great algebra practice right?! Well that's not why I decided to take this course.

Kent offers helpful feedback, especially if you discuss your work in office hours, that I felt refined my thinking and helped me write more focused, developed essays.

Oh boy, where to begin with this one? For starters, he flat-out didn’t know the material on the Art Hum syllabus. This makes sense since he’s a specialist in Japanese art, but I cannot for the life of me understand why he was cleared to teach a course where all of his lectures sounded like he had skimmed the Wikipedia article five minutes before class. I took this class at Reid Hall in Paris, and it was painfully obvious that he didn’t give a sh*t about teaching, but just wanted a semester-long paid vacation in Europe. He confirmed this theory by canceling class several times to go skiing in Switzerland or visit friends in Italy (but don’t you dare get sick and miss class without getting a note from a doctor, though, that’s just disrespectful). 
To make up for the lack of content in his teaching, Matthew would embark on truly fascinating stories about his personal life. There was that one time his friend made a joke about the “penis patrol” (fig leaves over dicks) that he just *had* to tell us every single time we saw a suspiciously covered dick (this happens a lot in art hum). There was the gleeful slut shaming of another friend’s teenage daughter who had just gone on the pill. There were endless “rude” French people who insisted on speaking to him in English, never mind that his French accent is oh so very painful and basically incomprehensible. And woe be upon the student who doesn’t laugh at his jokes about the “orange creature in the White House”—that’s a third of a grade docked right there.
Other ways to lose points: 
-failing to address him with the utmost formality in an email (“Dear Highest Professor of Wisdom, the Sage and Learned” is a good start).
-daring to submit *anything* over email, even if you have no way of printing.
-not stapling your drawings to your paper.
-showing up late because he made the start time earlier and you have a class right beforehand.
-visibly knowing more than him.
-basically anything that will set off his inferiority complex; never forget, he is supreme in all matters.
Also, he puts a very breathy “h” at the beginning of words that start with “wh.” This doesn’t actually affect his teaching but just hwhy, Matthew, hwhy??

Granted, we were supposed to have a midterm and a final as well, not to mention three smaller assignments, but he didn’t want to be bothered with all that grading during his vacation.

I'm not sure if it's an option to take this class with someone else but if you can you should.
Morris is an adept rhetorician, I'll give her that. Please don't be fooled. Intelligence does not make you a good professor unless you can get it to rub off, which she didn't. Everyone was getting B's and C's in the class. I should also mention that Morris does 2 of the worst things a professor can do 1) make you regurgitate whatever lens it is that she's reading onto an ethnography and 2) consistently relate texts to other texts that aren't on the syllabus i.e. we spent two whole weeks talking about Kant and another week talking about Derrida. Neither author was assigned to us.
Everyone in my section was either extremely confused or too insecure to admit it. I will say that my TA (Danielle) was the saving grace of this course. I am blown away by her ability to break down difficult texts and to decode Morris's out-of-touch lectures. Thank your local grad student.

If you're reading this, good luck. Cornish is not a good instructor. Her lectures aren't helpful for her exams. Plus, she goes on random asides during the lectures. Just like every other science course here, this class is mostly about doing the homework and going to her or the TA's office hours for additional help. The exams are hard because there are only 4-5 questions and it really doesn't feel like you get to demonstrate your orgo knowledge. Don't let her policy of dropping 2 exams fool you into thinking this class is easy. You need to understand all the previous material for subsequent exams. Exam 1 is the easiest, so make sure to do well on it. If you do well on exam 1, don't get cocky because the class gets much more difficult.
The first 3-4 questions on each exam are very similar to the homework problems, but the last question is always a ridiculously hard question that you can't study for. You just gotta write what you know and pray you get some points. Recitation quizzes barely count for anything, so you really have to do well on the exams.

A shit ton of homework problems. I heard that some people spent about 2 hours a day during the weekdays and 10 hours over the weekend for this course.

Jonathan Vogel has definitely improved over the years, considering his previous bad reviews below. I guess he reads the reviews and really want to be a better teacher. He is a nice guy who wants to sound sound fun, and sometimes does the job well. He talks a lot about econ majors either become professor and poor or go to IB and earn a lot, and he grudges that students today can report him for using ""sexist"" examples in class. I guess he might have had some unpleasant experience with the Gender-Based Misconduct office. I don't see anything inappropriate in his class though. Liberal snowflakes who's gonna be triggered by ""battle of the sexes"", a game theory example, please avoid. 
He really likes game theory and will mention it the whole latter part of the class. Like other reviews say, if you only get one thing out of the class, that'd be in a Nash Equilibrium, both players have ""no unilateral incentive to deviate"". This will be repeated infinite times in his lectures.
He does a good job at feeding the material to you, but not as inspiring - making you think of bigger issues like human nature - as Xavier Sala-i-Martin does.
Preview reviews say that his homeworks are easy and exams hard, but in Spring 2017 IMO the difference in difficulty was not obvious between HWs and exams. In fact, many people left Midterm 2 and Final at least half an hour before time up. 
Exams have mean about 70-75, stdev 15-25; he curves to a B+. About 5% A+; we had a class of 60+ and he said he will give only 2 A+s max unless in extenuating circumstances.

The worst Analysis of Algorithms class you can take. She grades really bad, and even 
gives F to some people.
She teaches easy concepts in the class, and makes HWs really hard. Mid-term and final are way harder than the HWs.

She will tell initially, she will grade on a curve and everyone will be fine. But in the end, she will mess you over. She grades absolute. I know a ""lot"" of people who got a C in her class. She grades the mean as B-.

I went into this class knowing nothing about eastern religions, so it was really cool to get to understand at least the basics of Hinduism, Buddhism, Daoism, Confucianism, and the cosmology of Tibet and Japan, all through the lens of Tantra.  However, this class was a little more difficult and intense than I would have liked (just because I was only taking it for a global core).  To start, Tantra itself is super confusing (which is the point of having a whole class on it), which makes the lectures inherently complex and it also makes it really, really hard to find outside information to supplement the lectures or clarify difficult concepts (other than the assigned readings) if you have to miss a lecture or are just generally confused.  Moreover, this class covers Tantra as it's seen in India, China, Japan, Tibet, and the West, and spans more than 3,000 years of time.  This is really cool because it gives you a really good overview of important concepts across the globe and time, but it is really hard to see how it all connects, and to remember the important people/places/names, etc.  The good thing is that the professors are aware of this, and try to make things as clear as possible in lectures and via handouts, and the TAs also grade things with the knowledge of how hard all this stuff is to remember.  That being said, it was kind of frustrating to me that we couldn't get into a ton of depth and that I often felt kind of confused and lost.  The topic, in my opinion, was pretty interesting, but not really mind-blowing; I never felt bored in lectures, but was not often amazed either.
In terms of how the class functions, McDermott and Como are both great lecturers who express themselves with a great deal of clarity and do a good job of summarizing complexity down into something digestible.  McDermott focuses on India, while Como takes on China and Japan; a TA named Guy covered Tibet.  McDermott is really direct and focuses more on dates, names, etc., while Como likes to tell stories and is much more prone to wandering off.  McDermott gives handouts every day of important terms (since otherwise they'd be difficult to spell) and images of artworks or cartoons.  The professors do a great job, but because there are no slides for either of them and the only lecture materials are McDermott's handouts which are only used for referencing terms and images during lectures, I found that it is absoLUTELY essential to attend lecture and take copious notes.  Otherwise, there is no way at all to reference anything discussed in lecture, which I found kind of frustrating.  For example, I got docked major points on one of my essays because I misheard Como in lecture and wrote the entirely wrong phrase throughout my essay.  I also think the class is kind of an awkward structure.  There were 70-80 students in the class, so it was pretty much impossible to have a discussion; whenever questions were asked, they were almost always answered by the same 3 people.  However, both professors still tried to have discussions, which I found not helpful.  There is a mandatory 1-hour recitation every 2 weeks, which I rarely found helpful since there's just too much ground covered in 2 weeks to cover in 1 hour and still have a discussion.
This class has a HEAVY reading load.  I read the first few days' worth of assigned readings, but 95% of the time I didn't do any of the readings because it was just too much.  I got through the class with an A- having almost never done the readings and doing each of the two essays the day before they were due, but always coming to lecture and taking notes and studying a fair amount.  Take that as you will.  The grading is fair/generous, and there is no midterm, only a final worth 40% of your grade, for which the professors offer a really helpful study guide.
Ultimately, I'd probably recommend the class.  If you want a super easy global core, this isn't for you, but if you want a decent sense of eastern religions with two great professors, then I'd probably go for it!
Workload:
20% - Participation - no attendance at lectures, so I think totally based on recitation attendance
40% - Essays (20% each) of like 8 pages or so on one of 3 topics given; totally doable, but I probably should have clarified some important concepts in office hours
40% - Final - totally fair; study the concepts in the study guide a decent amount and you'll come through with a B+ or higher, as long as you attended lectures and paid attention

I took this class because it is required for susdev majors, but I actually liked it quite a bit.  It is somewhat intense in terms of the difficulty and the breadth of the content covered, but I think it offered a great foundation for the social side of sustainable development issues.  The class is broken into two parts; Professor Wong covers the Economics portion, and professor Greenleaf covers the Social Science portion, with some guest lecturers as well.  In my opinion (and the opinion of at least 5 other people I've spoken to) Professor Wong was far superior as a lecturer.  His slides were posted in advance and were really helpful during class and as study materials.  He also did a great job making things interesting, staying organized, and providing readings that were directly related to the concepts.  Not to mention he's just a super nice guy who really cares about his students.  Greenleaf mainly just read from a piece of paper and showed very sparse slides, and awkwardly tried to make a class of 75+ students more of a discussion than a lecture, which was not effective.  I skipped about half her lectures and never really felt like I was missing out.  I often felt that I didn't understand the important takeaways from her material, which is a shame because it was probably interesting.
This class requires 3 books and recommends a fourth, which I found frustrating because they were pretty expensive.  I actually didn't really do most of the readings throughout the class (there was about 40-100 pages per class, which I didn't have time for), however when I referenced them while studying, I found that they were incredibly helpful, so I do think they are selected well.  Greenleaf's readings were really long and were mostly just case studies; they were probably cool, but I didn't read any of them because they were way too long and there were way too many.
Luckily, the TAs in this class were phenomenal!  Both the TAs and the professors made the class INCREDIBLY organized.  The recitations were easily the most helpful of my time at Columbia, and the TAs as well as the professors have a lot of office hours where they will walk you through the most confusing topics.  For the economics portion of the course, I think office hours were pretty essential sometimes, because Wong moves fast and it can be easy to get lost and stay lost during lectures if you haven't done the readings.  That being said, I disagree with those who say it's necessary to take econ prior to challenges; it would certainly make things easier, but definitely is not essential.
The psets in this class were reasonable, but were graded in a picky manner IMO.  There were 2 essays for which everyone had the same topic, but you could look at it through an economic or social lens or do some kind of creative work on it (examples and suggestions are given).   I loved the essays, not only because the topics were super interesting, but because you are given a great deal of freedom with regard to how to approach them.  The midterm was kind of hard, and the final was fair, but had a really annoying section with reading IDs similar to those in lithum/CC for Greenleaf's section.
Overall, if you're really interested in susdev, I'd totally take this class.  I came through with an A having done a reasonable amount of studying, attending most lectures, not doing the majority of the readings, and putting about 2 days' worth of work into each essay and test.  If you have to take this class as a susdev major, you'd be lucky to have professor Wong!

This class is all about international development, and isn't really all that technical unless you want it to be.  I'm a susdev major, so this was my first foray into civil engineering.  I found the topic of the class to be super interesting, but the delivery to be really lacking in a lot of ways.  It's a new class, so Sisul is still trying to figure things out.
To start, the class is held for 2.5 hours, once a week; this is way too long for a lecture-based class, especially because our class ran from 7:00 - 9:30 PM on Wednesdays, in a dark, hot, windowless room in Mudd.  I basically fell asleep every day even though I thought the stuff was interesting.  There is only so much of one man's voice and black and white slides that I can take, especially by the time 8:30 PM rolls around.  I honestly don't know why it was only once a week for 2.5 hours, since it was really mostly just a lecture.  If it would have involved some group work or more discussion or if he would have let us have more time for our group projects, 2.5 hours could be warranted, but that wasn't the case.
Each lecture covers important concepts in international development; the content was interesting, but Sisul (admittedly) put so little effort into the lectures, that it could have been so much better.  He wasn't organized, sometimes ran out of time, and used really boring slides (also admittedly).  The thing is, he's a nice and funny and smart guy, so he could have done a great job if he just cared a little more; it kind of felt like the class was a chore for him.  There were several guest lecturers; some were great, and others were mediocre.
The other component of the class is a semester-long group project, which you can choose from several topics given by Sisul and (theoretically) work with a partner organization on an international development project.  I found this whole process super confusing.  I could never really figure out if we were supposed to actually try to implement our ideas, or if the whole thing was theoretical and just for learning's sake; it was weird.  But it was kind of cool to look into an actual project in this field and conceptualize how the intervention would take place, from planning and design to monitoring and evaluation.
There were almost-weekly assignments, first individual, then group, which ranged in difficulty from taking 25 minutes to several hours.  They were sometimes helpful, but sometimes felt like busywork.  There was no midterm or final, but two presentations on the group project which were graded fairly.  There were ""assigned readings"" that were never referenced or spoken about.  Little feedback was given on any assignment or presentation and they were graded on a 10 point scale, which made it really easy to get a low score.
The redeeming thing about this class was how interesting the subject was.  However, I'm not sure that I'd say that could save it from the weird setup.  I think that if there was a radical revision of this class, it could be so great, however as it is now, with the weird length, the confusing and frustrating group project, and the somewhat careless professor, I don't know if I'd really recommend it.  I'd love to take the class that this class is supposed to be!

Tldr: Savin is a completely fair professor who does his job and nothing more.
Long version: Savin is a solid professor to learn Calculus IV from. Although I didn't attend most of this lectures (I had him for the 8:40 section and he teaches right out of the books/notes), the few lectures I did listen to were completely clear and intuitive. He stresses geometric intuition over rigorous proofs and teaches you to visualize what's going on with the random integration techniques you learn. He's not very personable though. 
His tests can be kinda tricky in a ""goddamnit I should have gotten that question kinda of way."" The ""hard"" questions are tricky because they force you to integrate over an awkward region, require you to see some trick like symmetry or rely on some intuitive understanding of geometric calculus. They're just difficult to solve in a testing environment. 
Just a note: Savin doesn't follow the usual complex analysis shtick. He does calculus of variations which I think is easier if you actually try to understand it. Problem is most people are too lazy and just didn't try. Luckily it was barely tested on the final and the related questions were unbelievably easy.

Midterm 2: Average 70 (He took mercy on us after the first catastrophe. It was actually pretty easy if you studied. All very straightforward calculations)

Savin is OK, not that good but not awful either. He teaches poorly, spends huge amounts of time proving easy concepts and then rushing through examples. And he honestly shouldn't try to rush, because he has a hard time solving calc problems: he doesn't bother to work them out beforehand, so he tries to wing them in class and always gets lost somewhere, and then stands in front of the board trying to find the mistake until a) he gives up and says ""well, the rest is easy, you should know it from Calc III"", or b) a student finds the mistake and points it out for him. The majority of the class ended up just staying home and reading the book, which was much clearer and a more efficient way of learning the material. Beware though of the last third of the course, after the second midterm, when he starts teaching calculus of variations. It's not in the textbook, so you'll need to go to class to learn that.
He assigns relatively straightforward homework problems, but gives extremely hard ones on his exams. The curve is decent (B/B+), so you can struggle through the exams and still come out fine, but if you really want to feel like you have a firm grasp on what you're doing, you won't get that here.
Ultimately, if you really have to take his section, it won't kill you, but there are better sections out there for sure.

I don't know who you are, but you deserve better than Phillips as an orgo professor. I don't even know where to begin.
Lecture: she's ok, but the problem is that you have to rely on her notes, and if you just copy everything she writes, all you have is a mechanism. She mentions important caveats and conceptual details casually, and if you blink you'll miss it. Some students record her lecture, and I guess that could help provided you have the free time to go over it at home. This could just be me, but I find her lecture leaves you without the intuition for organic chemistry that a lot of other professors provide. When I compare what I've learned to other classes like orgo lab, or to mcat style problems, it's like I learned orgo on another planet. 
Workshop: it's a circus. As other reviewers have mentioned, you get the workshop the day before, and then work them out on a Friday. I could see this maybe working with a very small group of students, guided by knowledgeable TA's and the professor, but there's no guidance for the first hour or so, and then she just wanders in and kinda expects that you've figured it all out. How she treats you in workshop depends on who you are and what kind of day she's having. She has her favorites who can completely screw up a problem and she'll act like it's the cutest thing ever, and then there's the rest of you, who will get furrowed brows, short answers, eye rolls, and face palms. I guess the workshop is a good idea in theory, but it's poorly executed. It's less Socratic seminar and more Lord of the Flies. Despite all this, the workshops were the most efficient and perhaps the only way to get the solutions. 
Grading: She didn't bother to tell us until halfway through the first semester that she doesn't curve. Not sure why. Maybe she doesn't know how to calculate z-scores. So don't feel good about yourself if you're scoring ten points or whatever above the average, it won't  matter. Why she thinks an 80% is the same whether the average was a 70% or a 50% is beyond me. Oh, and she made her third exam ridiculously hard and when asked about it basically said she was tired and didn't mean to make it that hard. Tired? Really? I don't know how her distribution ends up looking or if it's any harder or easier to get an A than it would be with another professor, but those who switched to doubleday second semester didn't seem to regret it.

You can work hard or you can work smart. Honestly I'd just find a tutor who's taken her class and done well. Don't bother with any practice problems  that she didn't write herself. In other words, just do the workshop questions over and over and sift through her old exams.

Aside from the workload the class is a good one. Sarah was a great teacher to have in my first semester and really made the class better. She also didnt really care how you learned, as long as you learned. In a small class of 12 she could most of us at one but was chill. We were all respectful but sometimes french got out of hand and the entire class including her was laughing. My friends and I also ate in that class. It even got to the point that we came in our onesies one day and she didn't care. And then out of odd circumstances she was ok with us bringing a gerbil to class. So Sarah is an amazing teacher to have regardless of the preset homework that the French department assigns. I would recommend her to anyone.

Prof. Ehud Sommer (he also goes by Udi) is extremely knowledgeable about the subject and very well-versed with the intricacies of Israeli politics. He knows the material well, but more importantly is a fantastic teacher (and a fair grader, probably even on the easier side). A class like this bound to be heated given the Arab-Israeli conflict and the Palestine issue, and I must say that it was very one-sided with mostly students from Students Supporting Israel in the class who attempted to overtake conversations and mock the Palestinian cause. As a class, this was fantastic - Prof. Sommer is kind, a great teacher, very fair, and also quick to ensure that the classroom conversations are balanced (he is also charmingly handsome). In terms of the people in the class though, this class was disappointing because of the lack of engagement with opposing views.
TL;DR: Easy class, fantastic teacher, belligerent (and disappointingly narrow-minded) students.

Very minimal workload - there were about 4-5 quizzes of which the best three counted toward the final grade (10%). These were super easy as long as you did the reading (Which tended to be barely a couple of articles).

TLDR; Meh teacher. Generous grader. Good tests and homework are okay. You'll learn the fundamentals if you study. Take him if you're an engineer looking for a pretty easy A. 
Long Version:
I'm really conflicted about my experience. I got an A in the class (barely missed the A+ cut off), but I don't feel like I learned much. Barraquand does interesting proofs in the class that are decently rigorous, but he doesn't really show how the concepts of linear algebra are applied or the beauty of it. For example, isomorphisms are apparently really important, but he just mumbled some definitions without much geometric interpretation. Have no idea how to prove it or why I should care even though it seems cool. So I didn't learn how to do real proofs or learn how linear algebra is useful. Thus his class is a bit boring and attendance really dropped to  20% after the first few classes. Be prepared to study a lot and understand the material by yourself. 
His tests are actually really fair, interesting, and do a decent job of testing your grasp on the fundamentals. There are usually some true/false questions that aren't very hard if you think about them (kinda fun in reality), a few easy computational problems, and then some very long derivations/proofs. The derivation and proofs would be hard if he didn't walk you through them (e.g writing something like ""hint, use a laplace expansion on the first row). His practice tests are similar/slightly harder than the actual midterm/final.
The final would have been annoying if it weren't for his generous grading and partial credit. I was really bad at multiplying matrices so I had to use variables for some final results. Still scored well above the average despite that fact I screwed up most of the matrix multiplication. 
Homework was alright. Not too hard if you think about them. Grading was really erratic though. I always checked my homework with a friend, and we had the exact same answers (yes I showed my work). We often got very different grades.

This is a difficult class. If it matters to you, I got an A- the first semester and a B+ the second semester (FYI this was my first ever B at Columbia). If this were any other class I would be really mad at myself for getting a B, but the amount of interesting information I learned made up for it and I don't regret taking this class at all. I'm premed, and I thought Mowsh bio would be the reason I drop premed. The class ended up instead making me want to continue to be premed even more. I think professor Mowshowitz is one of the best teachers I've ever had at Columbia—there's a lot of information, and some of it is difficult, but she is so good at explaining concepts. This is why my number 1 tip for this class would be to simply FOCUS IN CLASS. I started to pay a lot less attention in class second semester and ended up having to learn a lot of information on my own (which is much, much, harder). Another thing that made this class so great is that there was no required readings—95% of the things you needed to know were taught in class (which is another reason you need to FOCUS IN CLASS). If you pay attention in class, do all of the practice problems in a timely manner, and read her lecture notes (which are easy to read, to the point, and teach you that last 5% you don't learn in class), then I promise you will enjoy this class and not get a terrible grade. Mowshowitz isn't this demon everyone seems to portray her as—she's actually a very nice person and a great teacher. I'm surprised she doesn't have a nugget on here. I feel like her culpa page is dominated by people who got bad grades in her class (which is ok, grades aren't everything! Enjoy the more important things in life for god's sake). And yes, it's true, there is no real ""curve"" in this class, but this past semester if you averaged an 86 on the exams you would get an A-, which is doable. Good luck!

First of all, she is a sweet woman but here comes the ""but"". 
1) The lecture notes are posted on courseworks and it is hard to justify taking notes in class when you don't have to...?
2) I had Hadas as my TA, she is wonderful and informative but the discussion section did not supplement the lecture. It often times felt like a completely separate class. 
3) The exam format is fair because you only have to answer 5 out of the provided questions in each category but the grading process is a mystery to me. On the first exam I basically fact vomited all over the page. I wrote down everything I could remember and put 2-3 examples and ended up with a B+. On the next exam I wrote half as much and got an A. Grading is very subjective compared to Intro to American where I was provided with a rubric that explained why I got the grade I did. 
4) The final research paper was absolutely ridiculous. We had to pick a country and fix its problems. #rough

Was VERY fortunate to be able to have this man as my Lit Hum professor my first year. Although he seemed very disorganized/lazy, his lectures are actually pretty interesting once you get past his monotonous voice. I say lectures because his ""seminars"" just turn into him lecturing for 2 hours. However, after all is said and done, the class is SIGNIFICANTLY easier to get a better grade in than other classes. I would most definitely recommend to take this class.
For example, I NEVER EVER read, only looked at the material when he TOLD us when the quizzes were happening, and on the midterm (only one) he took out a major section and told us to skip it. For the final, he completely changed the Quote ID's and Essay questions. I got an A- for literally just showing up to the class.

In terms of material learned, this is an excellent course and I left the course feeling I had a great understanding of C/C++ and an improved understanding of programming in general. Jae is very generous with his curve and 55 points (of total course points) ended up a B. I read the text, watched videos on Lynda, and went to TA OH and found the labs totally doable but EXTREMELY time consuming. With Lab 7 probably taking me 20 hours to complete. The short answer/long answer midterm exams were (I assume) intentionally impossible with class medians hovering around 45. The final was fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, true/false so was much much easier. Jae will send you practice exams. Do all of them. One of the hardest things about his exams is the way he words his questions and attempts to trick you, so practice exams help. 
As an instructor...I found Jae to be too disorganized to learn from and preferred to study with my own materials. Pedagogically he was, honestly, a nightmare, a nightmare barely concealed sadist. and sometimes would send emails that told students they must ""suffer"". He also uses language like ""punish"" when speaking of how he likes to ""punish students who don't do ____"". Before he announces his miserably low medians, sometimes he will laugh for an extended period. etc. I found his teaching style completely creepy. And encourage Jae to get out his sadistic impulses in a more consensual environment. My friend told me some students thrive under these types of psychological tactics and are pushed harder. not me. and not many, many students I know. He is the only professor who teaches this course. So try to let his bizarre, upsetting, behavior roll of you. You will learn a lot. Just ignore Jae.
Also, don't cheat. Just don't. Jae is known to be obsessed with finding cheaters. And if you get caught, I have heard it is extremely unpleasant.

Overall, I liked Professor Taylor's Behavioral Neuroscience class. However, a few things to keep in mind: she's transitioning into a clinical career away from research, and is very busy, making her less accessible except for just after class. She's a good lecturer, but it's hard to interpret what she wants you to really know versus the flood of information that we got in class. The importance of some concepts were lost in the shuffle until we studied long and hard to connect the dots. She adds a lot of humor in her lectures and answers questions, even if they're based on an incorrect premise, and explains the answer she's giving. 
The way her tests are constructed force you to problem-solve through the mechanisms and why certain systems work the way that they do, which honestly is good overall. The tests are not easy--all short answers, and this can be both bad an good depending on which TA grades certain portions of the test (each section is graded by a different TA). It can be challenging to get the hang of it at first, and most students did not do well on the first exam. I really recommend recording her lectures and re-listening to them when you study, because most of what she explains in lecture could be exam fodder, but this isn't always reflected in the slides. 
Having said that, her exam questions are already basically laid out for you via questions that she posts at the end of each slide. There are way more questions on the slides than on the exam, which, again, means there is a lot to remember and study 100% to ensure that you don't falter through the exam. She likes succinct detail, but you're not punished for going into more than you need to in hopes that you hit the target she was looking for. In many cases, you have to draw detailed diagrams, and you often have to search through the slides and combine several diagrams she gave in order to get full points. Definitely, definitely go to the exam study sessions. 
She has you write two short papers, a seminar review and a faux popular science-style article on a new finding. I liked this, and it's meant to boost your grade while letting your indulge your interests and learn about a topic more deeply. Also, she assigns online quizzes that you can re-do until you get full credit, and the best part: she drops your lowest exam grade, which, if you do well on the first three, includes the final (so you don't even need to take the final if you actually did well from the get-go). 
I would take her courses again, especially now that I know how she thinks. You do need to spend a lot of time with the slide questions and studying on your own. There is a learning curve with that though, so keep that in mind.

This class was okay. Some of my peers and I had already taken CC and pretty much agreed that we didn't learn anything new; the lectures weren't very stimulating and seemed to delve only into a superficial level of analysis for most of the works. It was interesting that Professor Gundogdu chose to include Simone De Beauvoir on the syllabus but having taken several gender studies courses prior I found her analysis to be very surface level and even problematic at times. The TAs were very helpful; discussion sections offered many more provocative ideas and stimulating discussions.

This professor has a massive ego which can be rather annoying at times. That being said, I feel I learned a lot in this class and appreciated the organized and intellectually stimulating nature of his lectures. I would recommend this course for those considering going to law school and those interested in political theory. I really liked the assignments (argumentative essays) and felt they made me concretize everything I learned in lecture. Grading was done fairly and I appreciated the option to write an extra essay for a better grade. The final did well to put everything into perspective and I often find myself referring to the material I learned in this class in my other human rights and political philosophy courses.

I loved this course. I would have appreciated more feedback on my writing assignments but I genuinely enjoyed this seminar just for the sake of listening to Professor Lipsyte talk about different works of fiction. I came to a better understanding of what makes good writing solely from listening to him explain the successful aspects of different short stories and novels. 
Everything we read was great. I really appreciated that he didn't make us submit write ups on the works and trusted us to do the readings and come to class prepared. 
He allowed enough space for everyone to talk and also maintained a good balance of commenting on the works himself. 
Professor Lipyste has a wonderful aura and a great perspective on life in general. Just listening to him talk about his observations and perceptions of the world makes me understand why he is such a great writer.

What an incredible professor! Michael Fowler is SO knowledgable and his enthusiasm about the material is contagious. I found myself fascinated by his lectures and was inspired to enroll in several more art history classes (next semester) after taking this class. I am so glad I took this course early in my academic career as I am now considering doing a major or concentration in art history. Not only is Michael super intelligent and a great lecturer, it is clear he is a great guy who genuinely cares about his students. He is friendly and encouraging in office hours. Moreover he totally changed my outlook on art history and I have found myself referring back to the material we learned in this class for several of my other courses.

Professor Pflugfelder is a great guy. Very engaging and passionate about his area of expertise. Here's the problem, his area of expertise doesn't seem to be history as the course name would suggest. The vast majority of the course was dedicated to sexuality, gender relations, art, poetry, and pop culture. Although these are certainly part of Japanese civilization, I was very disappointed that more than half of all slides had no reference to political, economic, or military developments. We were expected to learn about these development on our time by reading a very dry and boring textbook. 
But here's truly the worst part of the class. There are three TAs. One is quite nice and very approachable. The other two are very unpleasant and clearly have some kind of bias. For my recitation, I got the nice one. I thought I was lucky. Wrong. Because she was my TA, she wouldn't be grading any of my papers or work. Having studied a whole week for my midterm and gone to around 80% of the lectures, I received an 87. Every single one of my friend who studied >1 hour, came to no lectures, and openly told me to my face that they BSed the midterm, received above a 95 (Pflugfelder graded their test). 
For my final, I was extra encouraged and decided to study twice as hard. Made pages upon pages of notes, met with other students in the class, read outside books, went over all the readings, got a B+ in the class (friends told me they didn't even study, got A's). So, moral of the story. If you love Japanese poetry, art, and historical gender relations - take this class. If you do not particularly care about any of those things, you can still take this class and have a 50% chance of an A/A+ and a 50% chance of B/B+. For me, it was a waste of my time, a waste of my energy, and a waste of a grade in a subject I love. I learned more from Wikipedia than from the lectures. If you have a real passion for Japanese history and culture outside the previously mentioned areas, don't take this class. It will actually make you lose that interest.

I usually don't write evaluations for a course unless it's really inspiring or really disappointing. Unfortunately, Organic Chemistry with Professor Phillips was the latter. To start off, I'd just like to say that Professor Phillips is a great lecturer, and I left every lecture feeling like I learned whatever she was trying to teach that day. The problem I had with the class came from its structure, which from what I understand by talking with other students was a pretty common experience both semesters in her class. This ultimately made me hate my organic chemistry experience.
Professor Phillips offers no practice problems other than her workshop questions. She does not release the answers to these questions and only goes over the questions on Fridays in a cramped corner in the Chandler help room, which is usually filled with 30+ other students. Other than by attending the two workshops she offers on Fridays or by getting the answers from a friend who attended, there is no way to get the answers. She does not release them and usually won't cover more than 2 questions in the workshops during her office hours (likely because 1/3 of the class attends the workshops and those students are a majority of the students who attend her office hours, and so they won't ask questions on the workshops which they already know). Furthermore, the few times I went to her office hours to ask questions about different reactions and workshop questions, she was quite condescending and made me feel dumb for not knowing a concept that we learned about just the week before. I didn’t go back to her office hours after this happened to me a couple of times.
If you were like me and could not attend most of the workshops because you had an internship all day on Fridays, and you did not know many people in the class to get answers from, you were basically out of luck in terms of practice problems. Additionally, she went over techniques for answering questions and other information we needed to know for practice problems during these workshops that she never mentioned in lecture. This information, I understood, was crucial to understanding exam questions, and it really put those who couldn't attend at a severe disadvantage. She says these workshops are ""optional"". This is not true in my experience. To do decently well (or even mediocre) in her class, you needed to attend the workshops. She tells us in class that ""students who don't attend the workshops still get high grades"". This is not a justification to call the workshops optional. This is not how grading statistics works. I'm sure if she took the averages of exams of students who consistently attend workshops and those students who do not, she would see a very clear and large disparity between the two. 
She also mentioned a handful of times that students approached her to ask that she restructure the class to make it easier for those who cannot attend the workshops - she essentially said that she didn't care. I remember one time during her office hours she told us a story of her meeting with her supervisor to discuss course evaluations from last semester. The major complaint in the evaluations was the workshops, and she told us during her office hours that she didn't care to accommodate the ""whiners” who asked her to give the answers to the workshops. This was very disheartening to hear, considering that a few students that I knew did not attend the workshops because they worked on Fridays because they were so busy during the week and needed that income to stay afloat. I wouldn't dare call those students whiners. They are some of the most hard working people I know, and I was very disappointed to hear Professor Phillips make such an assumption about them. 
She took the concept of workshops from her teaching at Hunter College. I can understand if this is how classes at Hunter are structured, and I can understand her desire for making students work together on these questions. In theory, it sounds very beneficial for students to work together on these problems and come to conclusions on their own. But this is not how classes are structured here at Columbia. We have 50 minute recitations for 4 credit courses, with the only exception being Biology, which had recitations that were scheduled on different days, which meant students could avoid conflicts with work/internships/other classes. Furthermore, recitations are scheduled (on SSOL), not a free floating ""optional"" recitation, which isn't actually optional if you want to succeed in the class. If she wanted to implement this style of teaching, she could’ve easily instructed the TAs to do this during the 50 min recitations. She said this semester that next year, the workshops will be a necessary part of the class. This is further evidence that these workshops shouldn't have been considered optional this year, and while this is a good step going forward, it shows that students this semester were at a disadvantage in terms of what is expected of them from the start of the semester. She stated they were ""optional"" during the first few weeks, and by the time I learned they were not so optional, it was too late to switch sections. I also cannot understand how they expect students to register for her class in the future where the recitation is 2 hours and only available once a week when they could register for another orgo section (Doubleday, Lambert) which has a 50 min recitation offered many times a week. I’m sure this will severely drive down the number of students in her section. My classmates also told me that oftentimes, the recitations went over 2 hours to 3 hours, so I would be weary if you plan to get out within 2 hours (e.g. if you have an internship or another class to go to after the workshop).
One may think that they could just get practice questions and solutions from online resources or from other orgo sections, but Professor Phillips’ exams are created in such a way that only someone who is familiar with her workshop questions can do well. The skills and knowledge needed to answer these questions come primarily from the workshops. In fact, many of the same string of reactions needed to answer her short response “guess the reactants” questions came straight from the workshops. 
Again, I'd like to reiterate that Professor Phillips is a great lecturer. She made me somewhat enjoy the topic of organic chemistry. But unfortunately, because of the workshops and exams, my experience with this class was ultimately very poor. My recommendation is that if you’re a postbac, and you have enough time to dedicate to this class, go ahead and take it. Just know that you will be doing much more work than your classmates in other sections. If you’re an undergrad, avoid this class at all costs. I cannot stress this enough. It will suck up so much of your time and energy, and you will still come out of the class with a lackluster grade. The postbacs on average put in so much more effort and really drove down the curve for undergrads. Believe me, even if you cannot get into Lambert’s class, at least take Doubleday. I didn't because it was a night class (and regret it), but trust me even if you don’t go to his lectures, you will still have an easier time in orgo if you take Doubleday's class and just read the textbook.

If you're someone who loves learning about cities, this class is great for you. The readings can be dense but they cover a variety of topics and you'll leave the class with a strong basis of urban studies classics and knowledge. However, many people hate this class because they show up and realize urban studies isn't for them. If you don't find reading about sidewalks cool, don't take this class. 
As far as the class structure itself, every lecture is spent going over the readings which is nice. It's a large lecture class and Professor Passell tries to make it more discussion based by asking questions and listening and responding to students' opinions. Some people didn't like this teaching style but I think it makes the class a lot more interesting. Also, questions he asks during class appear on the midterm and final so pay attention to discussions on them.
The midterm and final are IDs and essay questions that are pretty easy so long as you do the reading. The other assignments are essays that Professor Passell grades kind of harshly, and if I were to take the class again I would definitely take advantage of office hours to talk to him before turning in papers.

This seminar class is mostly student run, with Professor Morris occasionally interjecting. Compared to my first year seminar, in which the students could rarely speak, this was really appreciated. However, I often wanted more guidance from Professor Morris. I felt the discussions could use a bit more structure, and her feedback on papers wasn't always the most thorough. I felt the class made me a better writer, but not to the extent that it should have.

Professor Mora is very sweet and funny. She wants her students to not only learn Spanish, but also about Spain and Latin America. The class is pretty easy, and if you do your work and participate in class she'll like you. There aren't tests or quizzes other than the midterm and final. The only real homework you have to do is on MySpanishLab. Each semester you watch about three movies which I really enjoyed. There's an essay for each movie and Mora gives clear feedback. She has a big project each semester and that can be really stressful, especially in comparison to the lack of work you have before the project. However, if you stay on top of your game and do assignments for the project early then it's not too bad. One thing I will say is that learning Spanish in college is completely different than in high school. There is no longer an emphasis on learning vocab, and you're expected to learn grammar a lot faster. I'm someone who always struggled learning languages and hated Spanish class but this ended up being my one of my best classes and actually got me interested in learning Spanish to learn more about the Spanish speaking world.

Honestly, I think the hype is a little overrated. Professor Rieder often dominated seminar discussions and told students they were wrong when their opinion differed from his. This is a first year seminar, the point is for students to share their ideas, and there can be multiple interpretations of literature. The reading list was good for the most part, however we spent a lot of time reading and discussing an old issue of a magazine Professor Rieder was the editor of. This made critiquing what we were reading and expressing our opinions even harder. Professor Rieder will meet with students about all their essays to go over them, and that's really helpful. However, many students were frustrated that these meetings would often result in Professor Rieder telling them their ideas were completely off, and directing them to write an argument that he believed in, but the students didn't.

I only had Professor Light for lab lecture, not lab itself. But his lecture is incredibly boring. I often wondered what the point of the class was. He took roll so everyone had to show up, but it was essentially a class on the scientific method, which I would hope Barnard students already know. One lecture was learning how to format an APA style research paper. He could have just put a sample on courseworks, but instead we spent an entire 1 hour and 15 minute class going over which headings to bold, where to indent, etc. It was an easy A, but you honestly may want to take a more interesting lab if you're doing this to fulfill your science requirement.

By far one of the kindest, and most caring professors I've ever come across in any Columbia course. He works very hard to help you understand the material, and is very passionate about the source material. Furthermore, Jeremy tends to cut the heavy CC readings to a very manageable amount per week, which really helped me understand and appreciate the texts better. He was beyond flexible in accommodating virtually anything. I cannot recommend him enough! If you are not entirely sold on core classes, or have heard scary stories about CC, I definitely recommend attending Jeremy's class.

Taking her class is the BIGGEST mistake since I got to Columbia. She herself has quite a stellar record (a Brown undergrad and a Columbia graduate, chief editor of a publisher), but she does not know how to teach. Her description of each assignment is quite ""fluffing,"" lack of detailed, down-to-earth explanation. Office hour was usually not busy in the beginning of the semester, but later on, she limited the times you can go. Usually, it was 15mins per person. They weren't helpful mainly because she gave some random advice and sometimes even contradictory. She might say the draft was good in OH and later on in the final draft took points off. 
BUT, GO TO HER OFFICE HOUR. More importantly, make sure she understands and ""likes"" your argument. If she is not familiar with your paper beforehand, good luck with her random grading style. FYI, she is a big fan of justice, so no extra office hour or extra help, not even extra email.

I am speaking for myself, but if you would like a teacher who on the 1st day of class drives home the point that he doesn't teach because he has to like other professors but because he can, tells you to buy a second set of books if you want to return one set, uses rape as an example of the contrast b/w the Lockeian/ Hobbesian conception of natural rights, then McCaskey's the one for you. I was told that I have a ""thinking problem"" that I must work with him to fix...because he cannot tell me what is concretely wrong--syntax, grammar, whatever,--only that there is something wrong but he cannot tell me. I was told that my essay wasted his time, was singled out as the only one in class whose essay was NOT given back, was given permission to *not talk* for 2 class sessions to observe role model class participants, was told I was better off not talking, was told to seek life skills workshops to improve my essay *writing*--was given the choice b/w accepting this feedback or getting no feedback at all. 57% of the class got As but do you really want to be in the same class as such an asshole to get there?

Casey Blake deserves a good and recent review, so I'll offer one now. 
Prof. Blake is outstanding. He's not particularly funny (until you get to know him); he doesn't go for cute effects or snarky commentary. Instead, he pretty much stands at his lectern, looks out at the class, and lectures. But if you're serious about your intellectual and academic pursuits, if you care not only about what you're doing but also about what you're thinking, and how, and why, Prof. Blake is the man for you.
He's wildly smart; he's articulate; he's kind and caring. His lectures are well-organized (he projects an outline overhead), and if you've done the reading, easy to follow. His reading assignments (for both Intellectual History and Am. Cultural Criticism) are perfectly reasonable in page numbers--maybe even on the light side for a history class--though they tend to be dense and intellectually challenging, so they take a while. If you commit to doing the readings before class and to giving them the attention that they deserve, the lectures are interesting, the discussion sections are engaging, and the exams are reasonable. His papers are certainly challenging, but only because they require you to totally understand the material and to think creatively and analytically about it.
Prof. Blake takes his classes very seriously, and he expects you to do the same. Food, computers, phones, and tardiness are prohibited. He demands good, clear writing and doesn't put up with empty thoughts papered over with 7-syllable words.
In office hours, he is thoughtful and generous. He wants to get to know you and to hear what you're thinking and reading about, so go talk to him! It's not every day that you find a professor at the fore of his field who's willing to take your thoughts so seriously. True, he's a little awkward--be willing to wade through that. It's worth it.
A note about US intellectual history: it's essentially a class on the ideas that have been prevalent at different times in US history; it's about the way that people have thought about culture and politics at different moments in time. If you're looking for a class in which to learn about what war we fought when, this is not the one. But if you're looking to understand where today's ideas come from, if you're looking for ways to think about the world around, if you're looking for the company of brilliant thinkers, this is TOTALLY the class for you.

Even though Sarah Sze's name is on the listing, the class is taught by three professors, Sze, Kiki Smith, and Valerie Hammond. They split the days so you'll only see Sze 4 days out of the semester. For the days she is here, you feel that she is invested in her student's development. It takes her one critique session with you to figure out who you are as a person and artist. She'll provide insight to your artwork and personality to the point it's actually quite unsettling - She's like Sherlock Holmes at figuring out Art and Artist.
Unfortunately you'll be fighting for her time during class with MFA students who treat this class like their personal extra critique time with Sze. Fight for your time - this is a class primarily for Undergrad art majors. 
And yeah. Kiki Smith co-teaches this class. She's super awesome - though she is not as an effective an instructor as Sze - to say the least.

Professor Tippett is very helpful in class and in office hours. In general, he is a great teacher. 
The class size was huge (In the big room in Havemeyer) and the professor could not be heard well from everywhere. He used good examples in class which clarified my concepts a lot. 
The homeworks were generally easy, and mainly from the book. The homeworks are graded by different TAs every week to make sure no one student keeps facing a harsh grader. 
Midterms are often lengthy and include a good mix of easy, medium and hard questions. Midterms are usually out of 130-140 points, so losing a few points affects the percentage less than you would imagine. He also has bonus questions in all exams but they are usually much harder. Partial points are awarded.  A solid understanding of the material is required to do well on the course. 
I disagree with the previous comment regarding the curve. In the beginning of the semester he hands out an info sheet detailing the rough grade boundaries. (90+ A range,80+ B range etc) According to that I expected an A- given my percentage of 92-93% but ended up getting an A. In my opinion, while the original boundaries may not be the friendliest, he tries to stick to the boundaries. I do not think he downcurves at all.

I took this as a global core. The class is very informative, and intriguing in certain ways. However this is not an easy class for a non-history major to be in. It is a lot of reading and for those who are not used to doing a ton of reading, (read: for people like me in the engineering school) the readings take time and is often frustrating. Sometimes my brain was unable to process what Professor Rao was saying, because she can keep talking about a number of concepts simultaneously at a very fast pace. 
She usually never grants an extension, unless it is an emergency. The papers are complicated but the Midterms and finals are generally very easy and entirely from the study guide she gives.

Hansen is... interesting. Little bit disorganized. Little bit crazy. Whole lotta fun. Definitely worth taking this class if you:
    A) Know how to write proofs really well (and I mean really well)
    B) Have covered the applications of the material before and want a strong theoretical foundation
    C) Love math (like, really really love it)
If you fall into category C without being in either A/B, no worries! So long as you're talented, willing to put the work in (and/or give 0 shits about your GPA)then take the class!
Hansen has an excellent teaching personality, maintaining his student's interest in lecture topics most would find dry. Watch out for quips - they come out of the blue but are absolutely hilarious. He's helpful in office hours, although he does expect you to not be useless as a math student and have done relevant background research in whatever it is you're asking about.
Basically gives everyone a pass on the homework (as long as your avg grade is decent) but balances that by not curving the midterm or final - so study!
I personally came into the class with very little relevant background - it ended up kicking my ass (and my GPA went up in flames), but also helped enormously in developing my study habits and my understanding of mathematics.

In my first semester at Columbia University(Fall 2016), I enrolled in Professor Messick's ""Arabia Imagined"" class since it partially fulfilled Global Core requirements. 
I never ceased to be impressed by the breadth of Professor Messick's knowledge on rural Arabia. His lectures were priceless. He taught us the most intricate details about Middle Eastern societies and always shared a wealth of his personal experience while he was serving as a Peace Corp in Yemen.
I have to say I was apprehensive about this  4-point course because the syllabus contained a lot of reading but Professor Messick's continued support throughout the semester helped me understand the basics of this subject. We had to write a brief proposal for the Midterm which he graded generously. He always gave me feedback on my papers and granted me appointments outside his Open office hours. I was surprised at how he gave me appointments as many times as I needed during the semester because as the head of the Department, I knew he was a very busy scholar. 
I not only earned my first A grade in this class but it was the most rewarding experience to learn from someone as knowledgeable and experienced as Professor Messick. Several of my classmates I met afterwards told me they also did remarkably well in his class. A number of students in Professor Messick's class received A+ in this course.
Personally I would recommend this class to both new and current students. It is relaxing, rewarding and allows for an easy A. 
I was convinced I wasn't going to do well in his class because one his TA, who was Japanese, used to grade my weekly response papers and no matter how detailed responses I handed in, I never received more than 3/5 or 3.5/5 in those papers. However, despite the poor grades, Professor Messick gave me an A in my final grade.
Even though I initially struggled with my midterms, Professor Messick allowed me to change my topic for the final paper several times. Although the final paper was supposed to be only ten pages long, I was worried because I had written over fifteen pages. But as always, Professor Messick was flexible and allowed a concession. When I spoke to some other students here, some said they had Professors who failed them for writing ten extra word over the word count. I feel that I was extremely blessed and lucky to have someone as brilliant as Professor Messick as my teacher. 
Despite his unparalleled knowledge, Professor Messick's humble demeanor was disarming. He valued the opinion of his students highly and let the students speak their minds. Overall his class was fun and engaging.

This is one of my favorite classes that I have taken to date.  Prof. Milnor has a dry wit and an engaging way of lecturing-- class always flew by.  Her commentary made some of the drier material bearable, and she is aware that some of the films are a little hard to get through.  The movies and texts were interesting on their own, but Prof. Milnor's extensive background knowledge filled in gaps and placed each in context of social and politic events.  I liked the first half of the course better, as it focused on Greek texts and their film adaptations, but the second half (Roman texts and adaptations) was still interesting, just not as engaging for me.  I took it as a non-Classics or Language major, and I feel that I got 97% out of the class.  Some of the references were lost on me, but Prof. Milnor does a great job at introducing different themes and periods in Classical literature necessary for the class.  Overall, this is one of the best classes I have taken (with one of the best Professors!) and I can't recommend it enough.

Manageable if you kept on top of it.  A movie and a text a week, but Prof. Milnor went over the important parts of the text in class.  
For the grade, 2 papers, a midterm and a final that, as long as you kept on top of things (and paid attention when she told you to!) was easy to excel at (points just for naming the directors and years of films!!)

This is coming from a SEAS person who didn't read or write before this class: 
Jason was overall a great CC professor! He was extremely prepared for every class - he read students' responses to the reading before class and incorporated those into discussion; he knew where all the quotes were at all times and if he didn't know the answer to something right away he always followed up in the next class. 
His style of teaching was all discussion based - no lectures. He would give an introduction to the reading in the beginning of class and then open up the floor for discussion in which he participated just like the rest of the students. He never imposed his opinions and always heard everyone out. 
He also replaced some of the texts on the syllabus with more 'progressive' texts - feminist authors, readings about race struggles, different religions, etc. He was also very open to discussing current political events in relation to the readings (we spent half the class on the recent election - not fighting, but trying to connect it to some of the readings)
Workload wise:
Discussion posts: very short and pretty easy - 150-250 words
Essays: two essay - any topic but he gave a list of prompts to help us. All the essays had to compare two or more texts. 
Midterm: a few easy questions (had to answer 1 or 2 out of 3) - just facts or definitions, passage IDs (also like 4 out of 12) - had to know dates and connect each passage to other texts - not tricky aka nothing we haven't talked about in class

I really can't recommend his classes highly enough.
In his Critical Writing section you read a little more theory than I think many other Barnard professors will have you read, a little more theory and a little less literature, BUT even if you are not a theory-minded person, it's better you do it with a very skilled teacher than a less skilled one so I think it is abundantly worth it.

I had Gillian Turner (now Gillian Turner Young) for the summer session of Masterpieces of Western Art. While she is kind and will allow you to hand in assignments late, she is a harsh grader, and her feedback is anything but helpful. She will assign a descriptive paper, grade it, and state what she wants in the research paper. When you follow her advice on the research paper, she will criticize you for following her recommendations. She criticized students for being too theoretical on the descriptive papers, so when they submitted factual research papers, the students' grades suffered. Likewise, she warned students about being too factual on their descriptive papers, so when they wrote their research papers based on theory, she lowered their grades. If she is going to offer feedback, then she should not be wishy-washy with what she wants. She needs to make her directions clear. Clarity is important for students!
Honesty and ethical standards should be a standard for professors to uphold. When I asked her with other students about the descriptive paper grade, she told us not to worry as she gave nobody a grade higher than a B+. Later, a student showed us that she received an A from the professor. 
While I appreciate art, I was not a fan of her style of modern art. Nude women dancing with animals and in paint is not something I enjoyed. Professor Young had trouble understanding historical facts and figures, and our class had to teach her. For instance, she had no idea who John the Baptist was, even though he appeared in several art paintings. I would never expect a professor to know everything, but he or she is teaching about a historical era of art and the specific people in the paintings, and the professor has taught classes before in art history, then I would expect the professor to come into class prepared to teach accurate material.
Professor Turner also seemed to have obvious favorites in her classroom. She advised me to speak more often during class sessions. I constantly had my hand raised, yet she was slow to call on me. Also, my voice is not loud like other students. Vocal ranges should have nothing to do with class participation grades. 
We took two field trips, which were mostly enjoyable, except our class was told to be quiet in the Metropolitan Museum of Art because of her. She made us converge in separate groups to discuss art groups, so the discussions were an understandable distraction to art visitors. 
The class was three hours, and Professor Young showed herself not to be a leader in the classroom. The class went off topic many times, and she had problems getting the class on topic again, so when the class did get back on track, we were often released late. 
Pros: 
-Modern art if you're interested in the topic.
-Field trips to two art museums plus one art museum on your own time.
-You can hand in assignments late, but if you are a diligent student and turn in your assignment on time, your grade won't be any better.
-She is easy to speak to if you have questions, though her answers impacted my grade negatively.
-If you are her pet, that could be beneficial to you.

I took ""University Writing: Contemporary Essays"" with Shannon my freshman year, and I believe it was his first time teaching the class. Even though he seems pretty young, I was extremely impressed with his maturity and teaching style. He was a very engaging lecturer, got everyone in the class to bond with each other, gave funny examples, and still was a very effective writing teacher. Best of all was that he was an actual published writer for the New York Times Magazine, so you could literally feel the passion he had for amazing opening lines and tiny character details as he ranted about why they made such an effect on the reader.
He doesn't give A's unless you are a truly brilliant writer, which I think is the source of resentment for a lot of kids (especially in engineering) who want to just breeze by without giving a lot of effort. But he is fair, and will offer as much help as you need. The entire grade is based on 4 essays that go through multiple drafts, and he holds office hours in the writing center. If you are an English major or want to be published someday, you will love him as a professor. However, even if you're not amazing in his class, he will still treat you with the same respect as a kid who's obsessed with writing. 10/10 would recommend, and I'm not an English major.

As mentioned above, the entire grade is based on 4 essays, so if you knock those out of the park, you're good.

I took Foundations of American Literature with Andrew Delbanco (his last year teaching the course); Nick was my TA. Based on section, the other reviews of him seem harsh, although I don't know what his UW class is like. For American lit, Nick led discussions with a real interest in hearing what students had to say, and his comments on papers were extensive. His specialty is Melville, which was apparent during our classes on Moby Dick. By and large, class discussion was lively, if relatively unstructured, with students having some say on its direction.
Essays were open-ended, so long as we found some ""tension"" in the text, something we could ""contest."" In other words, we were supposed to make an argument about the text, not simply observe or summarize. If you can figure out how to do that, you'll do well enough on his papers.

DO NOT TAKE PROFESSOR LAX!!!! HE IS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!!
This class may seem easy at first, but I have to agree with all of the negative reviews. 
First, there is no textbook for this class which makes it difficult to do the homework because the only point of reference you have for homework is your notes from class. Lax always digresses during his lectures talking about bullshit such as parties he went to or experiences he had with friends. What made it more difficult is that he would digress for about 20 minutes thinking that he was entertaining and funny. News flash for Lax.... No one gives a fuck, just teach the material! When he got back to his lecture on Logic he had lost the whole class. I had a study group of 10 people and we were all lost because his digressions would cause confusion in our class notes. Everyone that I talked to from class (about 50 people) said Lax sucked. The only reason I can think of as to why I see some reviews that say Lax is a great professor is because he may have written those reviews of himself and/or had his TAs come on here to write those reviews for him. Trust me, Jeffrey Lax sucks!!
Secondly, I would go to the TAs for help but that was utterly useless. The TAs argued with each other over who was right in front of me and still they could not come to a conclusion on how to do the homework problems. Later as the class progressed one of them told me ""Dude, I have no idea, I am doing my Ph.D in political science with a concentration in human rights and not Logic."" I was like WTF..... How does a TA for a logic class not know what he is doing? Why is he a TA for this class? The TAs were clueless. Needless to say, I was lost. I went to Lax for office hours, but he told me to talk to the TAs first. After that, I was absolutely convinced Lax did not give a shit about teaching. I went to EVERY CLASS and took notes but I was lost. 
I took this class for a pass fail because I didn't want Lax to GPA fuck me.
I am taking an LSAT course learning formal Logic and the guy who is teaching it is way better than Lax. The book that they give you is easy to follow along. I think Lax should probably take some lessons from some LSAT course providers on how to teach Logic, but since Lax's paycheck does not depend on his abilities as a professor to present the material in a clear and effective way, so that his students can understand and grasp the concepts of this course, he will continue with his atrocious teaching abilities fucking over his students. 
I wish Columbia University would refund me all the money I paid for this garbage course.
Overall I would give this course a F.

I can't even find this class in the course directory again, so I don't know what that means but I took Religion and the Movies with Clemence in Fall 2016. Clemence is really nice and always available for questions after class or extra assistance. The thing is that this class didn't really require much assistance. Though her accent was sometimes hard to understand, the ideas of this class were a mixture of theory texts that you didn't really need to read that closely and watching movies. The theory and the films were definitely quite Christiancentric which was frustrating and though this was a generally enjoyable class it didn't really blow my mind or anything. I would say this is a good introduction to the fields of both film and religion, but if you're going in more interested in religion, like I did, there's definitely a lot of film theory to sift through as well. I didn't go to every class but you should probably go to at least half of them (plus sometimes in class you just watch clips or have interesting discussions).
Workload:
You basically need to watch a different movie for each class (and do attached readings). There aren't ways you're held super accountable for this but the movies are definitely interesting and class convos can get awkward when no one watched the films/did the readings. It's also important to remember that while watching films feels like easy homework, watching them through completely is very time consuming. I'm pretty sure we only had two or three ""papers"" that were each 2-3 pages long and were essentially movie reviews using a couple of the readings to analyze an outside movie. The readings are often dense but usually skimming worked fine.

Oh how I loved this teacher and this class. Professor Pittman was my first teacher on my first day ever at Barnard. He's really down to earth but clearly knows his stuff. He's always open to hear from students' experiences, though he definitely holds a certain level of feminist/social justice standard that you shouldn't really challenge. Most of this is predictable stuff- He wouldn't stand for any homophobia, misogyny, racism, etc. in the classroom. While this is great and definitely very important I did sometimes feel like our answer to every question was that it's straight white men's faults. I don't necessarily disagree but I didn't feel as challenged as I would have liked about the conventional ways even feminists view gender and sexuality. Besides that though the readings were fascinating and pretty manageable (mostly articles) and he also added in some artist works and issues into the class. Alex is the sweetest professor you could ask for and I'm really grateful I got to learn with him (and hope to do so again). 
Workload:
There are readings for every class and you should definitely do at least some of them because he spends most of class analyzing and mapping out the pieces. Besides that I'm pretty sure we only had to write 3 5-page papers about something related to masculinity that interested us and then use some of the class readings to back up our points. There is also a final ethnographic project where you go to a location (sports game, subway, gym, etc) and give a slideshow presentation with a group about the types of masculinity you saw there. You definitely need to do the work in this class but Professor Pittman is generally okay with extensions/special circumstances if you ask him before and overall this class is a light, fun class where you learn a lot.

Khane is a fascinating person. She grew as a secular Conservative Jew and now lives as a Hareidi Feminist Yiddishist. I definitely wish I'd gotten to know her more because she has such an interesting take on life, Yiddish, and women's issues. As for the class, which I took in Fall 2016, it started out amazingly. You definitely need to come in knowing the Hebrew/Yiddish alphabet (and knowing loshn koydesh is obviously helpful) but she gave me a really good foundation. Unfortunately, as the semester progressed she seemed less engaged and less patient with us. I think she may have been going through some personal issues so I definitely wouldn't let it stop you from taking the class, but it's something to be aware of. Khane tries to make the class fun by sometimes playing games in Yiddish or listening to Yiddish music. She gave me a really solid foundation in the language and the only other thing I would say is that, like most language classes, this one is definitely better if you take it with friends! I really got to know some of my best friends through this class and it made everything so much more enjoyable.

You have homework assignments from the book or the packet that you definitely want to stay on top of. There are also several quizzes and a final.

So Anne is a very nice and understanding person who clearly really cares about literature. However (and this may just be because she's a newer teacher) she could kind of be awkward leading the class and could have taken control more. I honestly ended up in this class as a last resort so the readings didn't necessarily excite me-if they had I probably would have enjoyed it more. This class just kind of felt blah, not actively bad, but not that productive either. The one thing I got from this class that I LOVED was the freewrites. Each class for the first five minutes she would set a timer and we would just write without stopping or censoring ourselves. I think she sometimes gave us topics but it was primarily for ourselves. I also kind of liked the class blog because it's always interesting to see what (and how) other classmates are writing.  So yeah, this is basically a high school English class and a non-horrible way to fulfill the requirement, I just didn't love it. 
Workload:
This class has a lot of small assignments in addition to the larger papers. They aren't hard per se, you just need to remember to do them. If I remember correctly we had 3 5-page papers, one final research paper (around 7 pages), a couple blog posts (there's a class blog) on specific topics and comments on others' posts, and you also need to bring a quote from whatever you read for homework that resonated with you (she likes you to put it on a flashcard and she collects if for a completion grade). There's also a good deal of peer review and having to write your paper on the class' schedule (which I personally found frustrating).

Oh Professor Kenny. I find myself saying ""YAS Gale"" on a regular basis (not the most proper way to describe a professor but it's genuinely felt and this is anonymous, right?). Professor Kenny is my adviser as well as being my teacher for Defining Marriage. She is someone who is very approachable (if anything I wished she had lectured more in class instead of just having us talk-she's very knowledgeable) and when you talk to her you come away with good ideas and actual assistance. She challenges you to think in new ways without being unreasonable and is an excellent resource to have as a student of religion and gender, and as a student in general (she one time spent a class going over proper citations with us which was very helpful). The class itself was fun and the readings were amazing but I sometimes felt like she was giving us busywork just to make the class a 4 credit/seminar level course. Overall though, if you are interested in religion and gender (and are aware that this is primarily a religion class) you should take this class to better your understanding of this fascinating legal and social construct. We basically spanned the United States from the colonial era to today (working reverse chronologically) and talked about everything from polygamy to family values. The only criticism I have is that this class was quite Christian/Protestant-centric but that is Professor Kenny's specialty. I guess I just wish that had been clearer in the course description/syllabus.
Workload:
We had readings for each class (which you pretty much need to read) and then you needed to have three quote responses (about a paragraph each) to the reading and post one of those responses on the class Courseworks forum. I believe there were 3 5-page papers (there was also a final paper which was around 8 pages but I can't remember if that just counted as the third one or an additional paper). The final paper is an individual research project on some aspect of religion and marriage that we had to write in a long form blog post style (with pictures, shorter paragraphs, and links) and post on the class blog with everyone else's papers. I sometimes felt like this class was a bit hard to keep up with, but not prohibitively so (plus Professor Kenny is usually pretty understanding). You work hard but if you're interested in the subject it's ultimately rewarding :)

Words cannot express how much I loved Liz and this class. Liz is a Phd candidate so she's not teaching in the 2017-2018 school year but I hope she comes back because she is a gem in this university. First of all Liz is really approachable and open about here thought processes as a teacher and doesn't assign anything she doesn't think is absolutely essential. She also weaves in a really cool and nuanced queer and feminist discourse into everything we did which you don't always get to see in a religion class. Most importantly though, Professor Dolfi forced us to both challenge the racism/sexism/homophobia that we found in Evangelical culture while simultaneously forcing us to explain why we found certain practices uncomfortable. She really wanted us to be responsible ethnographers-not afraid to say when something is problematic, but also challenging our own biases both in fear of other cultures and blind acceptance of our own. She valued student discussion while also filling gaps in our knowledge with really interesting lectures. This class is basically what made me realize I wanted to be a Religion major and I'm currently trying to figure out the least awkward way to befriend her this coming year because she really has been a wonderful mentor for me (also she's just really cool and I want to be her friend). 
Workload:
The structure of the course was weekly postings on the class Courseworks forum asking questions about or responding to that week's readings. The only big assignment was our research project (abt 10-15 pages) on pretty much anything we wanted to study in Evangelical culture. There's basically one rough draft (and peer editing round) and then you hand it in. There are also weekly discussion leaders (who work from the Courseworks question) so one time in the semester you will need to do that. This structure really worked amazingly for me personally but I definitely think that some people might find it difficult with so little feedback. Overall though she's a pretty fair/generous grader and understanding person.

Agi is a lovely person with a fascinating story (she's a Polish Jewish Yiddishist). She's very approachable and definitely wants everyone in her class to succeed. I took this class in Spring 2017 so, unfortunately, I don't think I saw her at her best. She experienced some personal issues which we were all very sympathetic and flexible about but at a certain point it became clear that she should've taken time off instead of continuing to work. She became forgetful and distracted (again, totally fair and human, just not conducive to teaching) to the point where she thought our Final started an hour later than it had been scheduled. As a person I understood but as a student her lack of organization/energy really frustrated and stressed me out as a student. The other thing I would say is that she is a better teacher for higher levels. There were several moments where some of the more adept students just answered other students' questions for her because she didn't understand their question or explain the concept well. Again, I don't think Agi is a bad teacher, but I do think there are some things (whether temporary or permanent) that she could work on.

I ended up in this class through a long series of events but it ultimately ended well. Professor Bernstein can come off a little serious or strange but she's actually really nice and really cares about all of her students. She also sometimes demonstrates more advanced karate moves which was fun. She basically just wants students to move and try their best, this is a pretty low-key class, though I do think it would have been more fun if I had taken it with a friend.The only other thing that's important to note (for all the nonathletic out there) is that there are periods in every class where she asks you to sit while she explains or demonstrates something, which I found nice and made the class more manageable for me physically.
 Just a side note, the PE department can be really accommodating/understanding if you talk to them! I ended up getting an Incomplete because of absences and I only have to go to one day of a PE course in the Fall to pass the class.

May not be the best at writing his own plays, but damn, the guy can teach. He keeps the class small (priority to majors and older folks) and he dedicates time to each student and their work.

I am writing this because I noticed a lapse in reviews on this class and this teacher.
This was one of my favorite classes of the past year. I looked forward every Thursday evening to a rich discussion and a deep exploration of short prose. Often class seemed too short leaving many of us slowly making our ways home while musing over all the wonderful pieces Prof. Ziegler introduced us to.
Class size is intimate at a cap of 12 so you get to know your peers and their styles very well and vice versa. Most of our class became friends quickly; we met before and after class to talk about writing or nonsense.
The power Ziegler brings to his class is of Graduate quality. He's funny, witty, jovial, and inspiring. I certainly pushed myself to write at a certain level in this class. And that's the beauty of short prose - it's not that you have to write A LOT, rather, you do have to write well and with efficacy.

Anne Higonnet gets a 10/10 in my book.
She is the spitting image of a classic art historian. She loves all the details, inner workings, historical contexts and it is so fun to watch her get all worked up over things most of us had never noticed!
A previous review called the class boring. That's the kind of basic response I would expect by those who sit in the back row shopping on Zara or scrolling through FB for the 10000000th time that day. In fact, this is a rich class which leaves you with a broad but strong knowledge of the art history you NEED to know in order to understand references and stay relevant.
Sections and Lectures are in perfect synchronicity (better if you have a good TA). Readings were long (sometimes tough) but I literally think about them almost every day. Tests, with the many identification slides and 3 minute short answer sections, were tough and there's no way around them if you don't keep up in class. 
That said, if you're an effective student, there's no reason why you cannot get a stellar grade in this class. What's more, you'll be better for taking it in the long run.

If you've heard that grad student/postdoc Core professors are hit or miss, she's definitely the former. Professor Bonner was a kind, approachable, and enthusiastic professor who made the class extremely accessible for those without any sort of musical background. The class was definitely much bigger on music history and studying the form of pieces than the technical aspects of music, and in retrospect felt a little superficial - parroting some lines about how X element of the music had Y affect sufficed for a lot of this class, though I guess that's to be expected of a music hum class.
The midterms and final were also very reasonable and graded pretty leniently, though most of the stuff on the exams was only covered in class, so attendance was pretty much mandatory. In general, if you do assignments on time and write down what she said about each piece during class, you will probably do well.
Oh also, her class covers the entire chronological sequence, from Gregorian chants onwards; if you were looking for a section that skips the ""boring"" early stuff, hers is not it. She does make the beginning rather enjoyable, though, and is one of the easiest parts of the class.

Phillips' style of lecturing mostly involves drawing molecules and functional groups on the blackboard and listing ways to convert them to other molecules/functional groups. You won't need a textbook at all, but it is absolutely necessary to come to all the lectures (getting lecture notes from a friend + going to that week's workshop is a close substitute, though).
In her first year teaching at Columbia, she had weekly two hour ""optional"" workshops in addition to the weekly 1 hour recitations. She basically comes up with the workshop questions as she goes along, the inspiration being whatever she thinks is important for you to know/practice. This means each workshop question doesn't really have a well-defined answer from the get-go, but you get to see how Phillips goes about solving her own problems and the factors she takes into account when coming up with an answer. You'll spend most of the workshop racing to finish all the questions before the answers are presented, which is honestly pretty decent practice for the time-limited exams.
Knowing how to solve every single workshop problem, and listening to her explain why some plausible-sounding solutions are wrong/not ideal, is key to doing well in the class. The things she tests for on the exams are all things she had you practice with on the workshops (even if they only appeared in a single question in the first workshop). Once you have that figured out, getting above the average on the exams isn't too daunting a task.

Personally didn't do a lot of studying (maybe ~2 hours before each midterm, and ~5 hours before the final) other than class time, recitation, and workshops, and ended up with an A-.

The class was divided as usual - the first half of the class covered DNA, and was taught by an adjunct (Professor Arias). The second half covered RNA, and was taught by Professor Manley. Arias's half was organized and structured pretty well - the homework assignments helped a lot with reinforcing the stuff learned in class and there were a lot of tie-ins with current research in the field. However, the execution was pretty poor - for all his enthusiasm and helpfulness, Arias was honestly a pretty poor lecturer, and the slides could be pretty boring or pointless at times. 
Manley's half seemed to be the complete opposite - his lectures were clear and excellent, but most of his exams involved heavy rote memorization (some questions were along the lines of ""Describe the function of the enzymes whocaresase and dontrememberase""), and research articles were relegated to presentations by the TAs on the last day of class that left a lot to be desired (I'm pretty sure the majority of people in the class couldn't answer the article questions on the final). In addition, while Arias had a kind of animated enthusiasm about him, Manley's style of lecturing was a little monotone and slightly dry - ""measured doses of enthusiasm,"" as friend of mine in the class put it.

I think ACM is a great, kind, and funny lady. Class could be a bit of a drag though, depending on what you like. She will go on in a gentle Italian accent about these stories that you start to zone out of because they only tangentially relate to the material. Important point: she doesn't do Powerpoint. So if you hate death by powerpoint this is a great option. That said, it can suck if you tend to daze or doze in class because you might miss some crucial drawing. The typed notes she puts online are confusing at best and cryptic at worst. For HW, you will need help (but you can work with classmates). I went to TA office hours every week just to make sure I was doing things right -- she'll give a basic example in class and then hit you with something crazy in the homework.

Brother John is a great guy. First off, he's a monk! How cool is that.
Anyway, I can confidently recommend taking music hum with John. The class was relatively easy, workload totally manageable, and John is really passionate and knowledgable about a majority of the topics.
The class as a whole was a bit disorganized, which is partly due to John's eccentric nature, and partly due to a sense of kindness/flexibility. He'd give us the questions that would be on the midterm/final ahead of time, and was pretty flexible about handing in papers too.
Workload:
readings every class
4 short responses spread out over the semester

Professor Beer's class is very straightforward. He doesn't deviate too much from the lecture notes he hands out and he's very predictable in terms of his exam style. His practice tests are good indicators of what the exam material is like. Lectures can be a bit dry but he does a fine job answering questions and teaching the material. He's definitely is not one to intentionally put out tricky material unlike other CU professors - so I would recommend.

A fine class -- really experimental. Connelly takes the time to get to know his students in the seminar. He can be at times discouraging regarding projects you propose, going so far as to tell you that he doubts you can do them. He doesn't mince words but I would hope that for future classes he will be more encouraging and trust that students know what they're doing, more or less. This is especially true since projects come up early. It may be more worthwhile to ask for proposals even earlier to allow more creativity and freedom. You can choose a paper or a technical project. 
Topics were fine: a broad overview of digital methods in historical research, usually one method each week, and its applications. Half the class dedicated to discussion, half to working on projects. Very enjoyable environment with a topic that attracts both history and computer science majors (great cross-section!). Largely optional sections on Fridays to get some feedback on your projects and work with TAs. 
Almost the entirety of the class focused on foreign relations and diplomatic history, US centric. This is largely because the professor already has a substantial corpus of foreign relations documents, ready for digital research. But the methods you learn here will be readily applicable to different corpuses in digital history (and indeed others are discussed at length). 
I recommend this to juniors looking to write a thesis, or history majors looking to prove a baseline technical competency for jobs. Re: thesis, considering digital methods can help you write a great and unique thesis in this emerging sub-discipline of the humanities. Re: jobs, if you choose to do a technical project, you can certainly highlight it.

Dabashi shows off his knowledge as often as he can. At first it is engaging but it gets tiresome very quickly, especially since he spirals into long soliloquys about irrelevant topics to the class. Coming into the course, I was really looking forward to getting some basic, knowledge of Islamic civilization since i had very little coming in. I don't feel like I got that knowledge here.
he's a very poor instructor and pretty much assumes you will get something out of what he's talking about. He's not very interested in bring there, except when he gets to talk about his own politics. He really slips into irrelevant topics a lot, things he is passionate about but which will make you roll your eyes after just a couple of lectures. It's also very easy for him to put his opinion up on a pedestal and to talk about how amazing it is. You get the idea pretty fast that he's not giving you a very wide scope of view points.
He doesn't really get into theological differences between sunnis and shiites or the history of conflict between the two. He is pretty fixated only on modern Arab and Iranian politics as it relates to Israel and the US. When he scratches the surface he fails to avoid talking about his own political opinions. He is incredibly bias professor. 
It's a real mind-suck for the middle of the afternoon (I took the 2:40-3:55 class).
You would be better off taking an intro course and doing extra reading about the topics that interest you the most.

The reviews from 2014 are still valid and mostly true for the current iteration of the class. Since the previous reviews have pretty much nailed the strengths and weaknesses, here are some things that I would emphasize: 
1) Every lecture is a PowerPoint presentation that seemed to be haphazardly put together without much organization. There is a lot of information presented in each lecture, so it is important to pay attention through the whole class (and maybe even record the lecture). The slides alone are not very good study tools as they often have random pictures and phrases that won't make sense weeks after you attend the lecture, so it is important to review the material the day of or soon after the lecture while it is still fresh in your mind. The textbook is excellent as a resource, and oftentimes specifics on the exam may show up exam verbatim. 
2) The curve is extremely unforgiving. The raw averages for each exam hover anywhere from 60 to 75 depending on the difficulty of the exam, but the overall averages are curved to a B- or a low B at best. This means that few people will be getting A- or higher - in my year, only 17% of the class received an A- or higher (this is much lower than Mowshowitz bio, on top of the fact that the students who take this course tend to be much more advanced). If you need a decent grade and are not confident in yourself, I would highly recommend avoiding this course. 
That said, the material itself was very interesting and it was a lot of fascinating information about the inner workings of the cell. She is clearly passionate and highly dedicated to the field.

Do. NOT. Take. This. Professor. 
I was duped into taking her by the previous reviews and statements from students who had her for the first semester. However, she is not a good professor. She's a great person who is trying very hard, but she expected the students who just joined her class for the second semester to already know how to write the way she liked. She did not take the time nor did she understand that the students who just joined had different professors who taught/did things differently. She expected you to already know how things were done.
All of the students agreed that she was very relaxed, lenient, and chill 1st semester but did a complete 180 for second semester. She was a very harsh grader when I had her for just 2nd semester and wanted you to write the viewpoint that she agreed with. She did work with students on their overall grades and helped you when you needed it, however she consistently contradicted herself on the things she wanted you to address in your essay, papers, etc. She would say include or address these things to one student but tell another student those same things weren't necessary. We all ended up being confused on what she wanted. 
In terms of discussion in class, they were mainly just her lecturing instead of us discussing. She would also often focus the entire class on something irrelevant to the material. For example, one class we were stuck on discussing what the word law and rules meant and then somehow got into politics. Most of the time we would focus on how certain words were interpreted but she would not tie it back to the book, so it was useless and a waste of time. She's very passionate and is doing her thesis on Dante which is helpful once you read that book, but her passion is for naught since she can't teach.

Anne Higonnet is the best professor I have so far had at Columbia. As a lecturer, she is engaging, incredibly knowledgeable, passionate and does her best to involve every student in the class in the discussion. Her lectures are built around input and debate from the students rather than her simply speaking at the class, and she gives a sense of really appreciating what everybody has to say.
As a person, she is an absolute gem. Prof. Higonnet is both personable, kind and an absolute badass. Her outfits are consistently very cool and she interacts with students in a way that makes you feel relaxed, but also very much in awe of her. The combination of her extensive expertise and welcoming, funny personality meant that I always wanted to do better in her class, and found myself working very hard to impress her and do well.
Essentially, I don't have a single bad thing to say. I took her class over the Summer in Paris and found it to be the most rewarding experience I've had at Columbia. Whilst other classes and professors where beginning to annoy me with their approach to education, ArtHum with her was a very welcome breath of fresh air.

The previous review is unnecessarily harsh. While this class probably is more work that the average CC class, if you actually participate/do the majority of the readings, you will probably get more out of it than you would in the average CC class. Kevin is great at facilitating discussions and balances lecture and discussion really well, and I got many take aways or new ideas to think about from almost every class. He even illustrates difficult concepts with diagrams that are super helpful and tries to cut down the volume of reading when he can. Kevin can definitely come across as a little bit of a know-it-all initially, especially when he interrupts students, but throughout the semester his quirks and mannerisms become much more endearing and you realize that he is just really excited about the texts and discussion. 
In response to the paragraph about the additional guided reading questions that he distributes, they don't really add to the workload of the class because you do not have to even look at them if you don't want to. He specifically said that they are to help us and guide our reading, especially if we are struggling to glean the important ideas from a text. He does not expect you to write answers to them or turn anything in. If you do choose to use them, you could probably just think about the questions and formulate an answer in your head. Personally, I never looked at them after the midterm first semester and it was fine.
The discussion board posts before every class were a little annoying, and I did always have to manage my time carefully that day in order to submit mine before the deadline, but they were effective in making me read more closely and think about the text critically. In the future, it would be a lot easier if the posts were due the day of the class rather than the night before to give students more time to do the reading and come up with something to write about.
As far a grading, I thought that Kevin was extremely fair. From what he said in class regarding his expectations for our essays, I thought it was going to be much more difficult to get a good grade on the essays than it was. The prompts definitely made you think, and some were pretty challenging, but he was always willing to help students work through their thoughts and the logic behind what they wanted to write during office hours. He also dedicated a large portion of class to answering questions that students had about the essays a few days before they were due. My only issue with the essay assignments was that a few essays were due during midterms/finals. It was really difficult to dedicate enough time to the essay when there were so many other things to study for.
Overall, I was really glad that I was in Kevin's class. I really enjoyed it and felt like I learned a lot. I would definitely recommend taking CC with him!

I don't know why Steve doesn't have a gold nugget. He absolutely deserves it!!! Best professor I have ever had in my life and I wish he could teach every class. He is so engaging and enthusiastic -- you can tell that he really loves his job and cares about his students. He facilitates the best discussions and encourages students to make to connections to the texts outside of class through the many trips that he offers, from museum tours that he comes up with and leads himself to a night at the theater and then having the whole class come to his apartment for dinner after. Literally I can't say enough nice things about Steve. His essay prompts are thought provoking and engaging, and they were actually fun to write! Before every one, I would go to his office hours to outline my ideas and just brainstorm and chat, and I always left feeling so excited about getting started. And his grading! To say that he is generous is an understatement. If I ever need to feel better about my academic ability, I literally just reread his comments on my essays. They somehow managed to be both encouraging and constructive, and I do think I am a better writer from taking this course. I was in his class two years ago, and I still go to his office hours just to talk to Steve. Every other class I have taken since has been a disappointment in comparison with Lit Hum. Take his class.

I was not a science major, but took The Science Of Psychology to fulfill the GS science requirement. Dr. Lindemann's class was well organized(best ever for me at GS), and i looked forward to every class.I would say her class is a piece of cake for a science major, but very challenging for a humanities major. You will need to read the textbook (i suggest before every lecture) and study her powerpoints and all related key terms for exams.. The TA's usually give  a great review before exams that i suggest you attend(since they create large portions of the exams) plus the audio for each lecture as well as the powerpoints, were available on Courseworks. In short, you are given all the tools you need to succeed, and it is up to you to do the work.. Finally, you must participate in experiments within the psych dept..

My experience in this class was so painful that I have to write a review to warn others. Perhaps it was my lack of knowledge in Economics, but this course, which is under the Sociology department is run more like an upper-level econ course than anything else. While you can easily slide by all semester by skimming the readings and sharing a few full-sentence remarks in class, all of a sudden he hits you with the 20+ page research paper and you are not prepared at all. DiPrete is an average lecturer at best, the class is held in the basement of the Soc building which is pretty depressing AND DiPrete, while VERY INTELLIGENT, is not the best communicator or animated speaker. I cannot emphasize enough how unprepared I felt for that final paper and how long and laborious the process of writing it was. The paper has to be grounded in the course theme, but cannot be too lofty or general. He urges you to pull a topic from the readings, but they are so boring and hard to understand. The only solace about this course was that it only met one day a week so when it was over every Tuesday I sighed the biggest relief ever and dreaded the next Tuesday rolling around.
Again, DiPrete is a nice dude, but not the finest lecturer. To summarize: you float through the semester, bored, but thinking that everything is okay, but then he hits you with the final paper and all hell breaks loose.

I watched McMath constantly talk down to students in a condescending  way. She didn't even try to disguise it. The only time she would really act like she cared about you or your thoughts was when we went to a theatre and she wanted to impress the managers, directors, actors, etc. 
She gave absolutely no guidelines regarding the long reports we had to do on a theatre company or whatever, and most ended up putting hours into the assignments, while she probably took 5 minutes grading them.

I took this class last year, which I think was the first time it was offered as a semester course rather than a summer. It was really incredibly interesting and you really do learn a lot about tradecraft, open source, and the more technical parts of intel. He definitely knows his stuff, but sometimes the class lacked structure. To be fair this was because most of us stopped reading and then didn't have much to say (the books are just background and you will DEFINITELY learn more from him so take good notes). He often told us to speak more, so maybe he wanted more of a free flowing conversation. All in all, though I really enjoyed the class. It gives you a new perspective on international affairs. 
Now for the final and only paper, which he wanted to be 25 pages though he didn't seem to mind a couple over/under, you can and should set up papers with him to explore topics. He will help you, but only so much so if you don't have much background knowledge be sure to really do your research. For the oral exam, I think I got lucky because he asked me like 3 questions if that. They were fairly easy too (names and functions of organizations) when I had prepared for so much more. However, I think this was because we were running short on time. Another person who took it earlier had a ~40 minute exam if I remember correctly, so definitely study hard and know your stuff. Reading every week isn't necessary because you can just cram at the end, but it also probably helps you stand out in class if you know your stuff.

Vincent is hilarious, passionate about French, and very fair.
Sometimes he gets very off topic, or spends too much time on one topic because he gets distracted, but more often than not the class is laughing.
Class structure was sometimes tedious but he would make it fun with his jokes and antics.
Make sure you pay close attention to/double check the syllabus. The syllabus structure is kind of confusing at times, but he often assigns things you need to have done to participate in class the next day.
VERY FAIR about essays (you get to correct and get points back) and the oral presentations (I got ridiculously nervous for my solo presentation and kind of messed it all up, but still got a good grade)
Tests were fair, not easy but not ridiculously hard - although he pays close attention to spelling/grammar mistakes. Always had several essay questions at the end.
Class often included speaking activities which I hated/loved.

The class didn't focus on learning to write, but was mostly focused on reading and interpreting the texts. 
Texts were occasionally interesting but more often not (in my opinion).
Very approachable in terms of office hours and getting help on essays, easy to talk to.
I think she had a very specific idea of what she wanted for each essay but I wasn't ever too sure what she wanted. Figuring that out would be good for your grade.
Essay grading was on the tougher side, hopefully you're already a good writer because you probably won't learn how to write from this class or from the feedback on completed essays.
Stickler for deadlines - once I submitted the wrong draft and still got a late penalty because the correct draft was submitted a day late. As far as I know she doesn't give any extensions or anything like other UW professors.

The majority of people skipped lecture and self taught because the lectures were monotonous, all over the place, and were very fast paced. Prof didn't answer questions very much/very well, seemed to have the attitude that the questions were dumb questions.
Homeworks were pretty hard, but necessary for the grade and also to learn the material.
Midterm seemed fair, similar to homework. The final was a lot harder with problems I had never seen in class or on the homeworks.

I agree that Manu wants you to question and see the world differently, but I would also argue that he only wants you to do that if that different way of thinking is his way of thinking. I was frustrated with the idea of people taking the class and not taking it seriously because it is an easy A, but I found myself doing that. I ended up not doing most of the readings. I read a few in depth and skimmed a bunch, some were really interesting and educational and a lot were just weird and bull-shitty. Take my word on the readings with a grain of salt, because, as I said, I didn't do most of them. I did take the final project seriously, but I don't blame my group partners (who all took it seriously enough) for not caring so much about it because of the way he grades. It was really easy to say at the beginning of the semester that I would do all the readings despite it not affecting my grade at all because I would find enjoyment out of it, but when I was overwhelmed with everything else, the reading for this class ended up being far down on my list of priorities. Manu often times encouraged us to come to his office hours, which I appreciated, but I didn't feel comfortable going and expressing my differing opinions on subjects he taught. And I am pretty liberal, I just don't see things through tunnel vision thinking one way is the right way to think about things. I love his philosophies about education, but I felt that he spent more time talking about how important it is for us to question things than actually creating an environment for us to question things. If you see things in a very liberal way, want to criticize America, great, take this class.

This professor was one of the absolute worst that I've ever had in my entire life. He was disorganized, his powerpoints were useless, and he the most unrealistic expectations of any professor that I've ever seen.  From reading 200+ pages in one week (which you didn't really need to read anyways because he hardly went over the material and instead just made up stuff as he went along) to 8 page papers where you're supposed to fit over 20 sections of detailed analysis.  This class is an absolute disaster.  Do not take this class, in fact, do not register for *any* class with this professor unless you want to be lost, confused, and overwhelmed. 
If you're a sociology major, you're basically putting yourself at a severe disadvantage by taking this class if you want to do post-grad studies because you will learn nothing.

James (goes by Colby) was a really nice, young guy and a pretty easy grader, at least in my experience. I submitted the weekly reading responses late multiple times and wrote the final paper without having actually read the articles that I was writing about and still got an A-. It's annoying that he places so much emphasis on the readings, but you don't really need to do them to get an A-, and he does make an effort to explain them before assigning them so they're easier to understand. 
However, like one of the reviewers below me, I absolutely hated the way he structured class. He calls on people and asks them to make comments about very specific aspects of the painting, which means that you'll be forced to speak about something that doesn't interest you while you actually might have something interesting to say about some other aspect of the painting, but his need to control the conversation won't allow you to take it into another direction. He also asks questions based on the readings, so things can get a little awkward if he calls on you but you have no idea what he's talking about b/c you didn't do the reading and you're not good at making things up on the spot. As a result, class discussions were incredibly boring (unless you enjoy listening to people nervously spewing BS while trying to guess what a professor wants them to say). 
TL;DR: The class is easy enough, but Colby managed to suck all the fun out of Art Hum. Pretty disappointing.
BUT he doesn't actually require you to go to the MET for one of the essays like most Art Hum Profs do! He'll also throw in a joke here or there to try to keep everyone awake, and he doesn't seem to mind if you have to submit something late.

Brendan is a kind and caring, but slightly difficult to read Literature Humanities instructor. With most Lit Hum profs, you are able to determine what makes them excited and secures you a good grade, but with Brendan one truly never knows. While the 8:00 AM wakeup for the class was difficult, Brendan often made up for it with some enthusiastic discussions in the morning. 
Although Brendan really loves to facilitate class discussion, I felt that class often devolved into tangents with the English majors battling for supremacy between themselves at 8:00 in the morning. Also, Brendan would himself would get caught up on mundane details which prevented me from truly grasping the work to its fullest. 
Nonetheless, He was always available during office hours and if you make an effort to go a few times while writing a paper you will end up doing well as Brendan helps you flesh out your arguments very well. 
While the written assignments were light for Lit Hum, the readings were heavy, which led to some difficulty in staying on top of the scheduled readings. Luckily, he doesn't give quizzes, so one could be forgiven for sleeping during the 8:00 AM class. 
The midterm was very long, consisted of just IDs, and was graded harshly, but Brendan curved it really well so most people were happy. I suspect something similar happened on the final. 
Overall, take this section if you are looking to put in the work to stay on top of the reading and don't mind meeting with the prof a few times before you submit an essay in a relatively lower stress section.

Although class lacked some structure, it's so small in size and we weren't that much discouraged by our lack of Turkish.

Sadly, Claire Catenaccio no longer teaches at Columbia - and it is our loss. She taught my LitHum class during her final year of her Classics PhD. I cannot say enough in her praise. Her background in Greek and Latin afforded us tremendous insight into some of the more formal elements of the texts (especially the poetry) that is sometimes lost in translation.We hewed more closely to formal analysis, which was a pedagogical decision that Claire discussed frankly with us.   She was unerringly witty, warm and awe-inspiringly intelligent, both one-on-one and while leading class discussion. She provided ways of approaching our analytical writing that were simultaneously intuitive and revolutionary, and my ability to construct an argument, either verbally or in writing, steadily improved throughout the year. Our class trips were informative and well chosen - we went to museums and productions of the plays we read. Claire's area of research was the performance practice of Greek tragedy - some of my favorite works of literature both in LitHum and in general. I had a weekly appointment with her during office hours, something I only wish I had begun sooner. She was an exemplar of scholarship and everything that the very best professors can be: a mentor, a role model, and a semi-divine conductor of knowledge.

I'm only writing this review because I felt like the previous one was a little too harsh.
I basically taught myself this entire course and I've never taken statistics in high school. I just showed up to every lecture and did work for other classes. That being said, Prof. Nguyen is nice. He has a thick accent and he basically just reads off the PowerPoints every lecture. I think an average of 10-15 people showed up for this 100-person class. He does let us out early though, which is nice.

If you can, TAKE ELIZA'S CLASS!!! She makes lit hum actually fun and explores the interesting themes that most other professors just ignore (gender, sexuality, race, class, etc). You will definitely learn something in this class, even if you've already read some of the books before. I also loved that she gave us the option to read Frankenstein instead of Pride and Prejudice (it was easily the best book we read all semester and all my friends were suffering through reading p+p for about the 5th time instead). You can really tell that Eliza actually cares about her students. She is always willing to help you figure out your essay topics and challenges you to improve your writing and thinking, but she also goes out of her way to make sure students are getting the most out of the class (offering interesting field trips, asking our opinion on how we spend class time and what themes we discuss, etc).

I don't know many teachers who can make a subject like grammar actually become interesting and fun, but somehow Vincent managed to do it. He's incredibly funny, genuine and by far one of my favorite professors at Columbia. Class is usually conducted in a relaxed manner, with Vincent effectively covering all the material while spicing things up with quirky personal anecdotes and jokes. Vincent is a fair grader, and as long as you put in effort and work you'll do well in his class. I would highly recommend taking third year french language and composition with him if you have a chance!

It's third year grammar and composition, so there's going to be a lot of writing. Expect 3 short resumés (summaries of texts), 3 expositions (essays of around 3 pages), 1 dissertation (about 9 pages long - probably the most intense part of the course), and 1 commentaire composé (5 page standard essay on a book you will read for the class). On top of that we also had 12 quizzes (super easy conjugations of one verb each class), 2 in-class exams and 1 final exam. This seems like a lot, but it's actually quite manageable if you manage your time well. I took the course as a freshman and survived, so it's definitely doable!

Professor Edwards is an awkward turtle, but likely one of the best lecturers I have ever had. This course is a heavy amount of work, but I can't imagine someone better to inspire a passion for programming language design as well as compilers (although he himself recommends Aho). 
Like everyone said before, the final project is a monster, it's really the whole course in one project. That being said, this is one of those classes where almost all the theory you learn in lecture can be directly or indirectly addressed by the design and coding of your project. 
Everyone says to pick an amazing team, which if you are like me and took the course your first sem in Columbia, is like saying try really hard to get lucky. Nevertheless, whoever your team may be, it pays off to work on your project incrementally and try to get everyone involved as early as possible. In the end, I think he mentions almost all projects get good grades although you'll have to work hard on yours.

I took this class because I was (and still am?) considering the Anthro major. I took the course spring 2017. Professor Morris, as many have pointed out, is a very brilliant lecturer, but the material is very difficult to grasp.I left every lecture feeling like something very important was said, but not understanding what it was at all. I am not sure how much I grew as a student. To be fair, I'm sure if I had went to her office hours (I was too intimidated) she would have cleared some things up, but honestly practically every sentence was difficult to comprehend.

I took 3rd Year Korean with Professor Chung, not beginner Korean, but I think she only teaches 1st and 2nd Year Korean now. Anyway, if you have been blessed with the opportunity to take Chung's class, DO IT. She is by far, my favorite professor, favorite teacher EVER. She's like an angel without wings, and I've never seen her angry, upset, or even peeved off; she always comes to class in a good mood, bright and bubbly, and ready to teach you all about Korean. A teacher with her patience and temperament would probably usually go into teaching pre-school kids, but the gods have blessed Columbia students by placing her here. That doesn't mean that she treats us like kids, though... She genuinely respected and cared about each and every student in her class. 
You also learn a lot from her class, and she does her best to incorporate fun things (about Korean pop culture, Korean dramas, etc.) into her class so that everyone stays interested. She's always willing to answer questions, and she takes student opinions into account when teaching too!

Brendan was a great professor to have every M/W, even as an 8:10 am class. The discussion was well facilitated and his office hours were often very helpful. Feedback on essays and grades seemed fair, and aside form occasional essays (of which we were given plenty of time to complete) there wasn't much work required outside of class besides the readings. We were encouraged to read Crime and Punishment over winter break, which I think made second semester a little bit easier than other teachers in terms of reading quantity. However, we voted on which work to read over break so this may change year to year. Seems like a cool guy, 10/10 would be friends with him outside of academic setting.

I don't know why there hasn't been a review of this yet! This class (taken Fall 2016) is an amazing class, and Professor Reed is -the- man to take it with. He's extremely nice, funny, and accommodating. The lectures move at an easy but reasonable speed, and the professor takes the time to provide intuition for and break down all the math and algorithms (if the diagrams in the slides weren't already good enough). At the end of some classes, we even watched some funny old shorts that showcased whatever concept we learned that week and that led into a bit of the interesting history in graphics. There were plenty of resources available - all the TAs were super helpful in office hours and on Piazza too.
The class is also well-paced in that the amount of work is relatively light throughout the entire semester, though we still somehow went through a lot of content. We go through things like colour theory, lighting models, basic algorithms for geometry (ray-object collisions), and their application to ray-tracing and pipeline rendering, interspersed with some short review o graphics-related linear algebra. Once the basic rendering process is down, we also get into optimization through special data structures, and sampling methods. By the end, we will have made a few interactive animations in OpenGL and a full-featured ray tracer. Each assignment builds slightly on top of the previous--so you need to know be willing to organize and architect your code a little (though he goes over this too).
I definitely felt giddy and proud of myself after reaching each milestone, as the images my program could generate looked more and more awesome and expressive.

Relatively light workload: around 1 assignment supposedly every week (but it ended up every 1.5 weeks), graded leniently as long as you implement the algorithm correctly (check against the example outputs/oracle, and pay attention to the gotchas that pop up on Piazza or in the slides).
For each assignment there's an optional creative submission, though unlike the competitive pit in Computer Animation, this is just for fame + maybe a few bonus points at the end.
There's a final exam too that's designed to be relatively straightforward for people who've attended the class or read the textbook, and have done the assignments. For us it was a series of short answers. It was pretty relaxed, and most people finished way ahead of the time limit.

The first class was intimidating and made me almost drop the course.  I didn't -- mostly because I had already bought the textbook -- and decided to stick it out for the rest of the semester.  Clément was patient, understanding, and made the course content easy to digest -- everything you want in an instructor. He really made an effort to make the class enjoyable and help each student learn French through class participation/individual feedback. I also think he made the class environment very relaxing and fun, and was never condescending or negative towards students, even when correcting them. Overall, it was one of the best classes I have ever taken at Columbia, and the fact that I decided to stay in the class -- despite it meeting on Friday evenings -- is a testament to that.

 I feel like responding a little bit to the single review that currently stands here. The review worried me, and it almost made me consider switching out of his class, which would have been a mistake! Yes, he lets the students drive much of the discussion, but the things we talk about require nuanced and critical thinking, so at least in my opinion, it wouldn't make much sense for him to just lecture at everyone how we are supposed to read these texts. And the important points are always covered. The discussions we have in class are helpful and memorable, and he pushes students to articulate clearly and defend their points. So yeah, not really an ""easy A"" type of class if that's what you're looking for. But if you want to be pushed to improve as a student, this is a great class!

I don't get it. At all. Cards on the table: my primary interest in literature (and the aesthetic more generally) is as a source of singular insight into an historical moment. This should not be mistaken for a vulgar ""sociology of literature""--e.g., the literary critic who mines Pere Goriot for historical tidbits about the Bourbon Restoration in France. The insight the aesthetic gives us is much richer than this! Primarily, I think, because the aesthetic has to do, above all else, with form. I don't feel like elaborating my theoretical position here...but I only mention this to show that even I, a person whom some might derisively call a theoryhead, am interested, at the end of the day, in intense attention to the aesthetic aspects of a given text. Even when teachers shy away from the historical, the theoretical, etc., I can still find something incredibly useful (and interesting!) in a good elaboration of a writer's aesthetic choices, or a situating of this writer through genre, etc. 
Erik Gray is thoroughly underwhelming even on this account. I really want to talk to the people who wrote the reviews below. Are they just easily impressed SEAS students? (Hope this doesn't come off as rude. Last semester, I was really impressed by a rather basic elaboration of Einstein's theory of relativity in an astronomy class. My friend, a physics major, probably wouldn't be. Nothing wrong with that. Our levels of specialization differ.) Or are they English majors who have been told so many times that Gray is the best professor in this department that they can only experience his class through, ahem, gray-tinted glasses? I really don't know! I'm so curious. 
Coming out of his Wordsworth lectures, the only impression I have of this monumental poet is that he was obsessed with childhood and nature. (THESE ARE FIGURES. THEY'RE FIGURES. I mean, yes, Wordsworth did really like nature, but this obsession gives way onto a more interesting and complex ideological position. This isn't even contentious or my particular viewpoint! Read any basic Wordsworth criticism and you'll see what I'm talking about. The love poems of the metaphysical poets are not really about love. This is a basic point.) 
Also, this is me just being petty now, but I hate the way he reads poetry aloud. It's so affected and precious and ""poet-y"". I don't know how to articulate this but it cheapens the poetry for me. Yes, poetry has its musical aspect, but that music can be teased out without this hammy reading of ""The Lamb"". But, like I say, this is a minor quibble.
Most of his lectures lapse into vague, humanist language filtered through the ""concerns"" (scare quotes b/c they're not actual concerns) of these poets. Wordsworth is, like, you know, innocence is good, but, in time, you'll gain more from experience than innocence. Gee, that's a nice thought. Makes you think, huh? Wordsworth spent his entire life working on the Prelude and this is what he's reduced to. Pathetic.
Why am I so heated about this, you ask? Well, I find it embarrassing. I really do. I'd be embarrassed to have a friend sit in on this class and think, wow, this is what you do? This is what you study? Second, I was in a great class on Romantic Poetry with Ross Hamilton before this but had to switch out due to scheduling conflicts. I figured, everyone goes on about this Gray guy, I really like Blake and Wordsworth, I'll just hop on over to his section. Such a mistake. Such a mistake. This class makes me depressed. I go in and I can feel myself dissociating seven ways to Sunday because I am so overwhelmed by this intense feeling of dread stemming from the fact that I'm spending good time and good money to hear someone give this...Romantic Poetry TED talk. 
Maybe he will get better. I doubt it. 
Unless you're the kind of person who subscribes to this literature-cum-therapy view (e.g., it's important to read poetry because it can teach us how to lead better lives!, it can teach us about ourselves!, etc.), then this class really isn't for you. Even if you ARE interested in that (it's okay if you are, I think no serious English student should be, but for the dabbler, why not), there are people who do it much better. I'm not a big fan of Edward Mendelson, but at least HE does some actually interesting close readings even while subscribing to this kind of view.
How do I petition CULPA to remove this professor's gold nugget? I saw the person below talk about how this class is not for those interested in the ""sociological take on literature"" or whatever, more for the l'art pour l'art crowd, but it's not even good aestheticism!

If you are ultra liberal, love watching CNN and Don Lemon, you'll probably like this class. If you're a classical Democrat, moderate, or any degree of right, this class will feel like torture. I was expecting a class along the lines of an intro to sociology course. What I got was everything I thought FOX News was just making up. She uses the term first year instead of freshman too because go figure, freshman, man, insensitive and all that ultra liberalist good stuff. The discussion sections can get worse depending on who you get. My TA opened the first session along the lines of ""is this a space where we can engage in a discussion of opinions without getting hurt?"" What that really means is say only comments that conform with whatever the liberal agenda accepts. If you want an A, vehemently argue how we live in a society with great inequality, should make great strides towards bridging inequality, men are oppressors (particularly the white man), men are evil, women are victims, college girls should be open to as many one night stands as they want because equality and college guys get more out of a one night stand than a college girl so victimization etc(if you think I'm kidding, I wish I was and there's more I his topic). This was by far one of the most pointless courses I have ever taken in my life. I'm glad others enjoy this but I'm writing this for those who might not be aware of what they think they're jumping into. If all of this sounds normal to you, go ahead and sign up and have the time of your life. 
One dynamic of the class is that laptops are prohibited from use. Understandable. Some professors do that. However, what makes this pretty dumb is that Prof pretty much reads off a paper and doesn't really stop. This makes note taking via hand a lot more cumbersome. I think this is something Prof can easily fix and would improve lectures.

A class that insults your intelligence. I don't know if all sociology classes are like this but I will definitely NOT major in sociology if this class is any indication of what's to expect ahead. Lots of apologist sentiment and marginalized this, marginalized that. The lecture and recitations felt like an ongoing song of complaints. This is bad because of this. Men are bad because of that. And that's it. No resolution. If you want to take this for an easy A, you might want to look elsewhere because you still have to give somewhat of a hoot to the subject material.

Is there something with Barnard Econ elective professors where they assign homework and give exams that are totally unrelated to what's going on in class? We learn a lot stuff you'd find in a basic finance book, and it's nice he gives bits of info here and there about the topics in reality. However, the problem sets are entirely mathematical. They aren't that hard but you're definitely seeing a huge chunk of it for the first time. Never mentioned in lecture and absent from any of the slides he posts.

I took Thomas Roma's Photography I class over five years ago. I am, in this very moment, listening to Richie Havens cover of Jerry Merrick's ""Follow"" (something only those of you who have already taken Roma's class would understand). You might be wondering why, after such a long time, I am now writing a review. To be fair, I have always wanted to write a review for his class. Probably since the first day I met him, which was when he was selecting his upcoming class roster, which he did while concurrently complaining that he was being forced to accept virtually all seniors (I was a senior at the time). 
I left Columbia for four years during my junior and senior year to pursue a life in another art form. When I returned to Columbia, I had quite a bit more experience than most Columbia undergrads. Upon my return, I had heard that Thomas Roma was an artist (a term I do not take lightly), and I was immediately drawn to him. For those of you who are wondering if the mentioning of Photo I on your resume will be hard to explain to your future bullshit employers or to your parents, please, just please, don't sign up for this class. This class is not for cowards. If you intend to live a cookie-cutter life, good luck. I am instead speaking to you young people who are drawn to the idea of Thomas Roma because you seek meaning beyond your dumbass GPA or your intro base salary. You may not understand this desire, whether it is real or merely some figment of your self-described ""privileged, first-world problems."" But you are drawn, and this is the class for you.
I majored in philosophy. When I was a second semester senior during my high school years, I recall telling an elderly alum that I was intending to major in econ. He scoffed at the idea of majoring in econ. He said, ""Do something more interesting."" I thought to myself, ""f--- this guy."" Well, the first year, I was an econ major. Second year, first semester, I had an existential crisis. Second year, second semester, I checked to make sure I still had my balls, temporarily became an econ-philosophy major, subsequently realized I was half-assing it, then demanded myself to pursue the one major I actually gave a shit about: philosophy.
Thomas Roma is on my mind now because I have been in the real world (as a performing artist) for quite some time. Every year, I get more rejections than successes. But for the past year, I have grown tired of my failures. I have lost the anger and drive that I immediately felt after every failure I had, which, in the past, I used as fuel to catapult myself to the next level. I have become apathetic. I have become an artist who thinks only of clocking in and clocking out, the very thing I despised that led me to my path in the arts.
So this is why I think of Roma now. He is perhaps the only artist who has not only been able to sustain his interest in his artistic expression, but also in his ability to speak so enthusiastically and eloquently about his pursuit, as if he is now just starting off in his career. You're not going to be a photographer. Who gives a shit if you can take a great picture. He will teach you what it means to express and to care. 
Many of you are too young to know what I speak of. Many of you are too stubborn to even consider the notion of apathy. But the real problem for an artist is not whether you will be able to withstand the pain of failure. It will be your ability to resist the urge to not care. 
I am desperately trying to shake this apathy from my soul. The memory of Thomas Roma might be one of the few things that could help me.

Pros
I really love the homework assignments for this course (which are pulled from MIT's Distributed Systems class); I find them incredibly relevant and interesting programming challenges for distributed systems. I also love that the instructions and test cases are all given ahead of time. It gives me a lot of time as a student to start early and make sure I write my program correctly to earn full points.
The TA is good, but I wish he would hold more than once regular office hours per week. One hour of office hours each week is not nearly enough for a class of this level that has ~80 students.
Cons
I find Prof. Geambasu's classroom delivery to be disorganized and hard to follow along with. I am not a fan of how she writes the lecture notes word-for-word on the blackboard, and she sometimes trails off while explaining something. There were several instances (e.g. first lecture of Paxos) when I went to the TA after class to clarify a concept, and was told by the TA that the professor made several mistakes when explaining the concept in class. 
The lecture notes are decent, but could be formatted better.

Although she tries her best, she is not loving to her students and does not celebrate their differences. She simultaneously thinks she is better than everyone else in the room, while I also get a sense of insecurity from her. Her class is pretty much a joke, although she threatens students with participation points when they're not there. She is always late to class, and does not respect her students. This girl kept raising her hand, and she kept laughing at her in such a belittling way. She would critique our poems but not have any real feedback - it seems like she glanced through them for five minutes. 
She thinks she is a big deal, and it's hard for me to respect someone like that even though she is accomplished. I don't think she read our final papers because I bs-ed all of mine, and still got an A in the class.

I can start off by saying that Professor John's CC class is not the place where you go if your goal for CC is to skate by doing as little work as possible. I had him for 2nd semester, and it was a significantly most intensive course than my CC class first semester. 
With that disclaimer, Prof. John is an engaging, skilled professor who's class was not only fascinating but truly impacted the way that I view the world. Every class truly allows for a comprehensive discussion of the text and leaves everyone with a deeper understanding of the material covered. Prof. John does not shy away from conveying his opinions about the text but leaves room for dissenting students to disagree. 
The classes tought workload ensures that a large number of the students who stay in are genuinly interested in the subject matter. The net results is that class discussions are sophisticated and infomative. 
The best part about the course is Prof. John's dedication to teaching it. As he will tell you repeatedly (and he means it) he is always happy to go meet over breakfast to discuss a text that students felt was missing from the course material or to engage in other discussion outside the classroom. 
In short, if you are looking for the easy A, this is not the class for you. But, if you are looking to get the most out of CC, look no further.

This is honest to god the best class I have taken in college so far. It really changed the way I see the world in many ways. It is also an amazing class to take as an undergraduate because it introduces theories and concepts the reoccur in almost every humanities/ social science field in the academy. Professor Pittman is incredibly nice and explains the concepts very well. My goal is to one day have just a fraction of his knowledge. I also really appreciated that he incorporated art, poetry, and even a little bit of film into the class. Honestly, if you are considering taking this class, please do!

Dr. Price does not have full understanding of human physiology to teach this class. She is a chemist, not a biologist, and for that reason she learns the material as she teaches the class. This explains why whenever someone asks a question in class 99% of the time her answer is ""ummmmm I'm not sure ha ha"". The way that her syllabus is planned out allows too much time for group quizzes and group assignments in class, which ultimately feels like a bio high school class with bad teacher.

Do not take this class if you want a future in econ or enjoy econ at all. I came into this class loving econ after taking AP macro and micro in high school. However, this class was confusing, taught poorly, and frankly much too hard for an intro class.
The professor is nice and quite funny in lecture, but lacks the ability to explain concepts which are fundamental to having a solid foundation in econ. He introduces concepts and ideas as if you already understand them; he simply glazes over them and expects you to follow. (I had prior econ knowledge and struggled in this class, so I really can't imagine how you'd get by without any.) I personally attended every lecture, but he posts all his powerpoint lectures online, so it's not that vital to attend class, nor is it necessary to ever buy/open the book. I would say that if you find a good TA, go to the recitations and their office hours, since Wout is actually v unhelpful and rude when you go to his office hours and refers you to the TAs anyway.
The problem sets are not insanely hard or harshly graded, but challenging given that the lecture is very theoretical and the problem sets are more empirical. In the same way, the midterm and final were quite difficult and honestly unfair. He tested concepts which were not introduced in class or addressed in the recitations.

Professor O'Meally's approach is autodidactic, folks. 
And that is what we are here to do in the big leagues. Yes? The model of the Ivy League is to teach us to teach ourselves. So, in response to some other confused reviewers; it isn't about an ""easy workload"" or being ""ripped off"" (to use a less pejorative word than the last reviewer) because the only way that you walk away with nothing is if you put nothing into it.
Professor O'Meally is not just a scholar, he is the foremost scholar--and yet he is somehow able to soar beyond that; he's like a guru. Yes, guru; for that is to say, he is teaching when he hasn't uttered a word. Yes, I mean he is able to convey the unsaid because he is adept in the art of listening. For that reason alone, he's on another level, plain and simple, people. And if you can't see that, then you're just not paying close enough attention because this gentleman contains worlds; he contains multitudes. 
I learned more in that class than I ever dreamed possible. I learned about Jazz, I learned about life and I learned to learn.
I came away with not just the course content but also his associative way of thinking through the material, an approach that I still employ today. It has to do with this whole idea of montage which speaks to an aesthetic that is unmistakable to jazz and the arts of the African diaspora. So---his being able to teach in the aesthetic of the Diaspora is nothing short of brilliance. 
Professor O'Meally is no doubt the best improvisor standing in front of a classroom today, and that is because he is so well prepared, so well versed in his craft. His lectures are thought provoking and timeless because he is just as sharp as they come.
Confession: I scored a ""B"" in the course; my first and only B while at Columbia and guess what? I could. not. have cared less., about the grade---because I was actively learning far and beyond the classroom. I ended up taking off on my own course of study! I was buying books and doing all of the supplemental readings that he had been suggesting along the way and I found myself mesmerized to the point of failing to complete my assigned tasks! So, for me, the grade became secondary to the learning experience-- which was an easy A+

Professor McIntyre was a phenomenal teacher. Everyone talks about how good Dean Awn is, which had me a feeling like I was missing the best LitHum experience by not taking Dean Awn. That was completely false. Professor McIntyre was a delight each and every class period, she is knowledgeable, humorous, and very down to earth. I genuinely laughed in this class more than any others so far, both from the light-hearted discussions and Prof McIntyre's humor and witty observations of the readings. She is able to identify well with her students and now that she is also teaching GS sections, she has adapted those discussions to better fit their perspective.  Our classes felt like very open-ended discussions about the literature, where we could discuss anything within the text that caught our attention. Although Professor McIntyre did lead the discussion, at times she seemed to be more of a moderator to keep the class relevant and on topic. She also showed a handful of relevant media that added a lot of depth and were really entertaining.
Professor McIntyre was also flexible with paper deadlines and was understanding of her students' busy schedules. She responds to e-mails usually same day, and provided me with a lot of useful feedback while I was brainstorming for paper topics. Yes, she is tough on grading papers, I got a B+ on all of my papers, but the quizzes for each book are so easy(as long as you actually read them) that it balances out her tough paper grades. When we read Plato, Prof McIntyre even brought in a subject matter expert from the Philosophy department, who added interesting points to the discussion.
For the participation grade, Prof McIntyre holds ""participation days"" where each student must speak 3 times during the class period for an A. She gives plenty of opportunities for everyone to get their 3 participations in for the A. This is very doable even for those who aren't so vocal in class like myself. 
As a GS student where LitHum isn't mandatory, I took it because I think it is essential to the Columbia experience. After taking the first semester, and learning so much not only from Professor McIntyre but also my classmates, that assessment holds true. I didn't realize how many different ways you could read a text until this class! It remains one of the most memorable classes I've had at Columbia. IF YOU LIKE TO READ, enjoy classics, and actually have the time to read at least *most* of every text, don't shy away from taking LitHum with Prof McIntyre.
As an added bonus, Prof McIntyre is on the board that makes the LitHum midterm and final, so I like to think her exam prep sessions were a tiny bit more guided since she helped pick the prompts.

Overall very good class. I am a philosophy major and this course helped steer me in the direction I feel like I am going in. Not sure if it's good for non majors since it deals a lot with the internal narratives of the philosophical tradition. We covered Heidegger, Gadamer, Foucault, and Derrida. Carman has lots of great things to say about Heidegger and Gadamer. He has some to say about Foucault, and while its not as inspiring and fascinating as his other lectures, it explains the material well. he has almost nothing to say about Derrida except in relation to Heidegger (which is important stuff.)

She loves hearing student's experiences/perspectives. Overall she is never discouraging and really makes you feel at ease (especially if you don't love speaking up in class, I thought I would have to force myself to participate but honestly it's probably the opposite). This class was super interesting, 95% of the readings are just as interesting. This class explores the Caribbean from before colonization to the time following independence. I would highly recommend this class and Professor Horn!

Good amount of reading, but usually the readings are super simple or super interesting so you get through them relatively quickly. She has a weird habit of having longer readings in the week as opposed to the weekend, so I just read ahead during the weekends to not ruin my week. 
Take home midterm and final
Occasional in class reading quiz (just about major themes in the text/new ideas/connections to previous texts) --- supeeerr simple, she gives 6 quizzes and gets rid of lowest score
20-25 min in class presentation on one of the readings (present major themes, etc, basically what's on reading quiz and have some questions for the class to discuss)
Lectures are always set up to talk about major themes, new ideas and connections to other texts so the quizzes/presentation are pretty simple.

Do not take this class. My other classmates and I find Heller ridiculously unhelpful and she has no idea how to answer questions asked in class. Her lectures are completely different from the reading, but of course her shitty lectures are what she tests on. She cannot explain basic concepts in biology well, and it's rather sad. Her exams are nearly impossible to study for because of the random questions she asks. I really regret taking this class and feel like I would've been way better off taking a 1500 bio class with a better prof.

I took Machine Learning with Professor Pe'er in Spring 2017 - I've been tardy about writing a review, but I feel it is necessary. I am genuinely in awe at how bad my experience in this class was, in seemingly every way.
To start: Professor Pe'er. It is fortunate that this man is, in fact, a professor - were I to call him ""Instructor Pe'er"", one may get the false impression that he is capable of instructing anyone. He is not. I have never seen a human so uniquely unsuited for pedagogy as this man. His classroom delivery is a complete trainwreck - when he's not stumbling over his words or saying ""ehm"" for 15 seconds, the words he does say are incomprehensible, even when explaining material that is clearly within students' grasp. Unfortunately, most of his lectures did not fall into this category, as the prerequisites for this class grossly understate the necessary statistical background. As a CS student with only an intro-level stats background, I rarely had any idea what the hell was going on in lecture. Professor Pe'er's attempt to bridge this gap was laughably insufficient: he spent one day at the beginning of the semester attempting to speed through all of statistics. It didn't play well.
Here is how Pe'er explained what a convex surface was: he brought a muffin into class, and passed it around the room. Here is how he explained differences in dimensionality: he printed out a picture of Antarctica, wrapped it around an apple, and placed it under an overhead projector. He proceeded to stab the apple with a knife, cutting out the outline of Antarctica. I wish I were joking. One gets the impression that he might not know the difference between ""preparing for lecture"" and ""purchasing lunch"".
The homeworks, while being the only useful part of the course as far as my own learning was concerned, similarly left a lot to be desired. Each problem set was written in impossibly dense and questionable English, requiring several hours of what was essentially decoding by TAs and other students before the meaning became clear. After this, the process of completing the homework wasn't much better. There was a STRONG emphasis on the mathematical background of the material, which I wasn't a fan of: despite having completed a course in machine learning in the computer science department, I feel I've gained almost no intuition for how/when to use the models we supposedly learned. Focusing on the math behind ML seems to be typical of 4705; this could have been fine if the instructor was capable of pulling it off. He was not.
Even Pe'er's slide decks were of marginal use, combining incomplete/incomprehensible sentence fragments, mathematical derivations that were somehow both excessively long and too incomplete to actually follow, and completely indecipherable scrawlings done in class. The textbook for the class was also too dense for a beginner in the subject to comfortably consult. In order to be able to complete the homeworks, my classmates and I had to teach ourselves all the material from slides we found online from other universities. Literally nothing the professor provided to us contributed to our learning in any capacity.
The only saving grace was that the TAs were all qualified, helpful, and not completely devoid of pedagogical abilities - unlike the professor.
I regret this class more than any class I have ever taken in my time at Columbia. I had read the previous Culpa reviews and thought, ""Oh, it'll be fine."" I flew too close to the sun. It was not fine. Do not take it. Do not take any class with Pe'er.

Would not advise. Rios is not very good at explaining concepts. He seems to be very smart, but his teaching skills are just not there. He will work through complex problems in his head, skip steps, estimate numbers ""to make it easier for him,"" and his handwriting is horrendous. The class follows no particular order and he says that the book is useless even though his syllabus says you won't succeed unless you use the book... Overall, a very unsatisfactory experience.
The only issue is, it seems that all the professors in the Stats department here at Columbia are just as bad based on other reviews. I have yet to find a teacher that has more than 5 reviews stating that they're ""good."" 
For anyone wishing to take statistics, search for Professor Leonard on youtube. He has a robust channel that covers all of the concepts and he is amazing at explaining them. This is the only reason why I did not fail miserably in class.

I feel as though I am fairly qualified to write a review for Barraquand as I have taken 3 semesters with him so far: Calc III, Linear and ODE. Over all, I think Guillaume is a great teacher in comparison to the rest of the math department. That being said, he is not the best teacher ever. GB is not the best teacher in terms of actual lectures. He sometimes goes on tangents of proofs which are albeit interesting not really relevant to the class. That being said, when discussing actual content he is fairly clear on what to expect and how to approach most problems. In linear particular he was a little confusing, but that was perhaps due to the subject matter rather than himself. His classes are somewhat dry but enjoyable, he cracks a lot of jokes and the class is fun.
I think GB is an extremely fair teacher. All his HWs are very fair and his grading gives a lot of partial credit. His test, while difficult ask about the entire scope of the topic. They are very well made and really show if you understand the material. His curves are very generous, the last commenter was accurate in terms of grading. Moreover, since the tests are difficult and the averages are usually in the 50s-60s, getting a good grade is a lot easier then meets the eye.
I would gladly recommend him to any of my friends.

If you can, try and do the 3000 level version of this course instead of the 4000 level one. The 4000 level one is open to graduate students, and it will royally screw the curve for you.
Be prepared to marry the book. Forget your girlfriend, forget your boyfriend--the book is your new significant other. I can't promise a happy voyage for you either, however. The book is decent at best.
Just know if you're going to do any learning in this class, it sure won't be from the teacher. Sure, she's nice. Sure, she tries. But in the end, she's just a poor teacher. Have a question? Raise your hand? Oh, don't bother speaking-- she knows what your thinking (except she doesn't). She will finish your questions for you, assume everything is good, then move on. 
""Okay, fine, I'll be dandy with the book,"" you may think.
Too bad she isn't organized either. She'll grab a little material from this chapter, or that chapter, until the exam shows up and she can't even tell you (true story) which sections the midterm is on! (""Uh I think we just go up to Chapter 3... Just follow the note I posted!"")

I loved Prof Taylor's class! TAKE THIS CLASS if you like flexibility because she lets YOU choose how you want this class to work for you. We had 3 midterms and she gave us the option of either taking the final and dropping our lowest test score or keeping our 3 midterms and not even taking the final!! Her lectures are pretty okay... she follows powerpoint slides which are pretty boring but cover most of the material and then she gives us optional study questions after each powerpoint which are SUPER useful because she will NEVER test you on anything that's not on the questions. That being said, if you put in the work, you can do well in this class. Overall I liked her a lot, she makes jokes in class and always explains the concepts with lots of examples to help you understand. Definitely recommend her!!!!!!

DO NOT take this class unless you're a CS major and are required to. 
This is absolutely the worst class I have ever taken. 
Jae Lee is is a horrible teacher.  
Besides being extremely disorganized and random in his lectures, he is arrogant and rude towards his students. You will honestly learn the material better by going through the TA's recitation notes and going to the TA hours. 
Learning C and C++ is beneficial to anyone wanting to work in a CS-related field, but Jae insists on forcing students to memorize very specific syntax of functions, and ""punishes"" (his words) those who can't regurgitate the exact code on paper. Frankly, most of us found it ridiculous.
The midterm exams are insane. The median is usually around the 40's-50's.  This should tell Jae (and Columbia) that his course is awful and is failing the students, but we all realized Jae takes some kind of sick satisfaction in teaching ""the hard course.""
Jae also has this weirdly extreme obsession with cheating. This isn't exaggeration; he is constantly on a delusional witch-hunt for anything remotely close to what he considers cheating. Supposedly, he runs all written code through a program that compares your code to EVERY SINGLE SUBMISSION FROM THE PAST 5 YEARS. There are 3-400 people in the class per semester. Meaning that many people's code will match someone else's somehow, and if you deny it, he starts a full investigation. 
How this sadist is still allowed to teach a required course for a major, I will never understand.

Michael ""Mike"" Woodbury is a really nice guy. And impossible teacher. His main teaching style is: do the homeworks/learn the material by yourself and ""go over it"" in class-- which is really just a waste of time. The homeworks (2 problem sets + 1 webassign/week) are generally not too challenging, but the harshness of the grading really varies. He expects you to know your stuff, and he will force you to think about math. If that sounds good to you, take the class.

Professor Han is a kind and caring person who if very knowledgable about her field (a few of the readings she assigns us she co-wrote) but I'm fairly certain this is the only class she teaches and she's definitely a psychiatrist first and professor second. 
The homework consists of readings and 3 essays over the course of the semester. The readings are either psych research or books. Psych research is hard to understand for someone with no psych/science background, but general idea is easy to get through skimming. Books are really damn good. I'm really Free Food for Millionaires and it's 600 pages but I've read 540 pages in less than a week - it's that good. The 3 essays are relatively creative. One is an analysis of your own family, another is about the model minority myth, and a third is literary analysis of the books you read.
Class only meets once a week and is super low maintenance. Participation is really easy, especially if you've done the reading, and a lot is sharing personal opinions and anecdotes. Sometimes we spend part of the class screening a video, and sometimes we have speakers. It's called ""Asian American Psychology of Race"" but it's mostly East-Asian, and the class make-up is predominantly East-Asian women.
I like this class because it's pretty easy (although I've only gotten back one essay so far) and gives me an excuse to read interesting books. Also encouraged me to take advantage of the psychiatric services at the university, which was good for me. I'm not really sure if I learned a lot over the course of the semester though. Professor Han is also not very available (my pet peeve is that she doesn't have office hours, and offers to meet in her office downtown, which is annoying because who wants to trek all the way there for a 20 minute meeting). It's not necessarily a life-changing class (though Free Food for Millionaires is kind of life-changing) but I don't regret taking it either.

I had her for calculus III, and she was way better than I could have expected. 
Advantages: 
Very easy midterms (all 3 of them). Every midterm was identical to the practice midterm, with some numbers changed here and there. As long as you understood the questions on those practice midterms, you were guaranteed to do well (read: essentially guaranteed A/A+).  
Straightforward problem sets, all problem sets have answers available online. The level of the problem sets was always the same level of difficulty as the textbook taught, so there was always an example problem in the textbook very similar to the ones on the problem sets. 
Final was also not that hard. Final was especially short, so really no trouble to finish, but it did have a couple questions that required a level of understanding further than just having the right equations memorized. 
Disadvantages: 
Quiet lecturer, not engaging, and made mistakes on the board frequently. But calc III, especially the level required from this class, is something you can teach yourself. Going to lecture did not give me any extra understanding that the book did not lay out clearly. 
Conclusion: perfect if you want to a gpa boost and you're comfortable skipping lecture and just learning from the book. I got an A but barely studied for any of the exams. Also nothing is curved in this class so prepare to push yourself to get every part of every problem right if you want to do well (VERY achievable).

He gives a little more work than other professors, but he grades fairly, so if you do the work you will probably end up with an A/A-. His midterm was very straight forward, it was mostly quotes we had covered in class. At the beginning of the class he seems intimidating and he tells you have to do all the readings, but the workload is very manageable. Only a certain amount of the discussion posts are graded, so most of it goes to your participation grade (which is really good if you don't participate much in class). As far as the readings go, it's just like any other class; some kids do none of the reading and still do fine. There are more essays than other classes, but the first few are really short, the third one is an outline of an essay, and the last one is a standard essay.

Karen Phillips is an incredible professor. Her love for teaching and her passion for her students and organic chemistry truly radiate through the classroom. I have such a strong knowledge in organic chemistry after taking her class both semesters and am so appreciative to have had her as a teacher. I am not saying her class is easy by any means- you need to be invested by putting in both the time and the effort in order to see good results. While this may seem like more work than other orgo profs from the outset, you end up coming out of her class with a strong background in orgo- enough that I haven't even opened up my orgo MCAT book once. While her workshops may seem like extra time out of your day, you would end up spending this time plus more working through the problems on your own anyway. Dr. Phillips also attends these workshop sessions and I also found that having her explain the problems in her own words was really helpful in the learning process. Keep in mind, Dr. Phillips is not required to have these sessions- she is taking time out of her own personal work day to be there. This is just one of many examples of how Dr. Phillips goes above and beyond for her students. 
Yes, there is no curve, BUT  I am telling you that if you have strong work ethic and you are invested in the material, you can succeed. Her exams fairly reflect what she has taught in class and the problems she has given you in workshop. There is no surprises, so with the right amount of effort you should see yourself improving substantially from exam to exam. There will be moments of despair, but at the end of the day you will come out of the class an expert of orgo!

Terry Plank is my hero. This woman is the reason I chose my major. Her lectures are honestly inspiring and so brilliant. She's hilarious and super down to earth (even though she's literally a MacArthur genius). Her Geochemistry for a Habitable Planet course is the highlight of my week. The problem sets are definitely difficult but extremely rewarding. Her lectures are very engaging and provide all of the material necessary to do well on the tests/psets. She definitely values being able to apply knowledge more than rote memorization, so it's worth it to go to office hours and work through the concepts. On the whole would 10/10 recommend this class to anyone interested in chemistry or earth science.

Professor Moncada is a great man, he chooses extremely interesting texts for the class. The workload, however, is horrendous. This is a colloquium class, so a lot of work is expected, but the readings easily exceed 100-200 pages a week including ""memos."" These memos are not reactions, but rather critical analysis of 4-5 pages. This, on it's own would be a lot of work, but there is the research paper component requiring large amounts of research. He is a harsh grader on research papers and could be better about communicating what he is looking for. Do not take this as a first colloquium. If you want to take this class, make sure you feel comfortable with other colloquiums first.

I liked this class a lot. If you're looking for a course that you might actually get something personal out of, I would recommend this. It's probably the only class I've taken where I experienced the ""love of learning for learning's sake"" thing. The material is fascinating and uplifting, and Branka teaches it passionately and eloquently. She also breaks down the difficult concepts clearly, so you actually get a good understanding of the philosophy. The class was a lecture but the size was small, so we could participate if we wanted to, but weren't obliged to. We only read Emerson and Thoreau. For Emerson, we covered a sizeable chunk of his essays. For Thoreau, we did Week on the Merrimack and Walden.

A philosophy class for students who want most of all to avoid actually doing and discussing philosophy.
If this sounds like you--if you are taking CC purely because you have to and would normally avoid philosophy like the plague--then by all means enroll in Dr. Ramsey's section. If not, then read on.
As far as I can tell, there are couple reasons why students might enjoy Dr. Ramsey’s CC. She really is a nice person and is approachable. It’s not hard to sense that she is genuinely concerned about the success and welfare of her students. Other commenters have noted her frequent digressions about binge drinking or partying to be strange, but to my ears it comes off more as genuine good-will than anything else. Dr. Ramsey is a perfectly fine person, but she builds her class around such hopelessly misguided pedagogy that I began to dread Tuesday and Thursday afternoons. 
What about her teaching style is misguided? The biggest issue: this class allows for next-to-zero critical engagement with the philosophers on the syllabus, preferring summary. 
Class discussion works in the following way. Ramsey will ask the class a question about the text with a right and wrong answer, usually asking for the definition of a key term. Sometimes the class will be silent either because nobody did the reading or nobody wants to answer a dead-end question. Other times someone will answer and, regardless of whether they’re right or wrong, Ramsey will nod and move on to the next question. There are times when students respond to one another, but the problem is that the question being ‘debated’ is often just a definition to be found explicitly in the text, so that the discussion quickly revolves around flipping to different parts of the book to find any occassion when the author is reiterating a point already made just to speak in class and pick up some participation points. I understand that the CC curriculum moves very quickly so that there might be little time to do anything other than summarize doctrine, but even History of Philosophy courses (and other CC sections!) with equally packed syllabi manage to set aside some time for substantive discussion, so there’s no excuse.
When discussion doesn’t take that form, it’s when Dr. Ramsey decides we should be having a ‘fishbowl’ or ‘Socratic circle’ style conversation. This consists of Ramsey separating the class into groups of four to discuss four questions (again, these are not discussion questions in any recognizable way, instead they’re just asking for summaries of the text). Then, one member from each group is selected as a representative for one of the questions to meet with all the representatives from other groups and discuss their shared question in front of the rest of the class. This is repeated until every question has been discussed. If all that sounds confusing that’s because it is confusing (it took our section some practice before we all understood what we were meant to be doing), and once you do understand what this fishbowl is supposed to look like, it’s clear that it is an awfully ineffective way of generating debate. Why? Because while the five or so representatives of a question are carrying out their discussion, the rest of the class sits silently and researches their own question so that they can prepare a few answers to recite during their discussion in front of the rest of the class. It’s clear that Dr. Ramsey expects everyone to participate, so everyone spends these fishbowl sessions deciding ahead of time what to say instead of listening to other students or engaging with their ideas. 
And really I like to think of these fishbowl conversations as a good metaphor for the way Dr. Ramsey’s class works in general: you are forced to wade through seas of confusing bureaucracy and contrived ivory-tower ~pedagogical methods~ just to avoid meaningful engagement with the ideas you encounter. 
That principle applies to writing as well. Almost all of the writing done in this class consists of merely summarizing arguments, and much of the work comes from navigating Ramsey’s bizarre expectations. There were a total of five writing assignments (one of those was split into multiple parts, involving group work and google form submission) plus twice-a-week discussion board posts and an in-class oral presentation on a thinker of your choice. 
This has turned into a rant, but all this is to say that this is a CC section which manages to be difficult but not rewarding. If you enroll in this section you will learn the bare basics of important philosophical doctrines laid out in the past couple thousand years. But nowadays this is something you can get from scanning wikipedia. If you have even marginal interest in developing skills such as learning how to engage in rigorous philosophical discussion or how to write argumentatively or how to read critically, I do not recommend enrolling in this section.

If you have the choice to take it another semester w it's someone else, do so now. Nadia Urbinati should be your last choice ever, because you should not expect yourself to be able to drag yourself to her horrific lectures to actually listen. 
As explained by others below, Urbinati has a wonderful resume and is a renowned political theorist, but her lecture style and manner of speech really does not reflect that. If you can tolerate her thick accent and unstructured lecture style (which I doubt you will), you will realize that you are truly better off spending the same time reading your texts and making notes instead of being shouted at her. She refuses for students to use laptops even when most of the long  readings are digital and is very rude about any students having disabilities that require them to use a laptop. Don't even think of challenging her on that, or on anything else - she deals with questions extremely badly. She either ridicules the question without fully responding to it, or claims that it is a good point she was about to make despite it being contradictory to her entire lecture. Your biggest supports will be yourself, any study group you manage to make to divide the readings up and your TA. Urbinati is truly horrible and should be avoided at all costs.

The first day of the course, you get awed by looking at the course content and topics that will be covered. CNN, RNN, Self Driving cars, LSTMs etc. People who got into the class feels that this is the best thing they have done and who didn't get in pity themselves. 
Class:
When the 2nd lecture happens, then we realized how the rest of the course is going to be. Professor teaches it completely in a way as if you are already an expert in Deep Learning. Classes feels like as if the topics are just being revised (like they do during school days before exam). This course should be called Advanced Deep Learning  and prerequisite for this course is that you have already taken a deep learning course before. 
After few days, students literally stopped coming to classes as we realized that there is nothing to be learnt in class as most of the lecture is very high level and hard to grasp.
Assignments:
There are 2 ridiculously heavy assignments. Expectation of the accuracy on the assignments it too high for any normal first time deep learning learner would feel. Instead of inspiring us to work on the assignments, they are made to demotivate you from taking any deep learning course ever. 
Also, what the prof teaches in lecture is completely mathematical and what is asked in assignments is completely practical implementation of the stuff. You are expected to do everything on you own. 
Project:
Then there is project which covers 80% of the marks. The expectation on project is so high that it alone will take you full semester. 
Suggestion:
Don't take this course unless you are too thorough in deep learning because it won't be taught in this class.

But what we heard was that the grading is tough in Stein's class and we didn't feel it any lesser under Mihalis too. 
Assignments:
They are really really hard. And almost never made sense because in class what he taught us is literally very simple topics than what is asked in Assignments. Assignments should inspire students to learn more not to demotivate them. 
Exams:
Midterm is average in terms of hardenss. SHOCKING aspect is that final term has full portion and it made the whole thing very heavy, and also given that second half has heavy topics like Greedy, DP, Graphs(5 chapters), Flows, Linear Programming and NP. Moreover, there was an assignment due in the last week and the exam date is also kept very short.

Barbara Spinelli is the best damn professor at Columbia. She's the kind of person who is genuinely interested in what you want to do with your life, what your favorite movie is and why, what your family's like, and your personal story of how you came to Columbia. You feel less like a student and more like a person who gets to practice speaking Italian with your older, much smarter friend. You don't even have to go to office hours to develop a close relationship with her because her class is extremely conversational and interactive. 
Despite being so friendly, she is extremely well-qualified as an educator and directs the entire Italian language program. Our class runs on schedule and covers a ton of material each week. You will have to pay attention and study vocab that you don't know. 
If you accidentally skip an assignment, she will let you turn it in late for full credit, probably because she actually wants you to do well in the class. Her grading is very fair and she will gently call you out in class for missing something simple that you should already know. 
At the beginning of the semester, I knew zero Italian, but by the end, I felt like I could talk fluently in six different verb tenses about literally any topic without stuttering or freezing up.
Honestly, attending her class is the best part of my day. It's never boring and mainly consists of answering questions out loud and giving your real opinion on different situations. We listen to songs and watch funny movie clips in order to learn stuff. You can tell that she puts a lot of effort into making the class interesting, and she's always well-prepared. I'm really going to miss her next semester because she doesn't teach the next level up. I highly recommend taking any class with her because she's so awesome!!

Professor Sivard is hands-down a gold nugget––she really cares about her students. My experience in her class has given me a really meaningful understanding of art that has helped me understand society better, and links really well to the rest of the core. I think this is the section to take if you believe that the core can make your ways of interpreting knowledge more whole. 
The museum trips were probably my favorite part about the course, as we took time to look at female artists and artists of color who are left out of the curriculum. Dr. Sivard is quite cognizant of the fact that the curriculum is made up of white male artists, so she gives a lot of opportunities to think deeper about how marginalized people fit into our conception of history. My favorite segment looked at the female nude and the power-based implications these images have on the viewer.

- Straightforward midterm, two papers, final project (creative format), and final. Though I procrastinated, she gives plenty of time to prepare for each and understands that we have busy schedules.
- Fair grader––gives great feedback and lets you make changes to your first essay for a bump up in the grade. Does not make the class unnecessarily challenging as I've heard of other professors. Great class for a schedule with a full workload. Just show up wanting to learn!

Diana Romero is a terrible teacher. Honestly one of the worst Spanish professors I have ever seen. I think my Spanish skills may have actually become worse while taking her course. If Diana likes you then you are set- she will grade more leniently for you and treat you with respect. This being said, even if she likes you there is still no guarantee that you will get an A, or do well. However, if Diana doesn't like you, then you can completely rethink getting that easy A in Spanish. If she does not like you, then she will be rude to you in class, and in her emails when you email asking her for clarification, and she will give your grade no slack. She also is not very willing to meet with you outside of class for extra help, and when you do meet with her, she only will meet with you for about 5-10 minutes. 
Diana cannot explain grammar. She expects you to just know how to do the work and grammar straight off the bat. This is an elementary level course, so please explain to me how anyone people in this course should be as fluent as Diana thinks you are. She  speaks only in Spanish in class, which makes sense as it is a Spanish class; however its an elementary 2 class, so she needs to understand that students will not understand everything she says in Spanish. And when you ask her to repeat or clarify because you don't know what she says, she will just keep repeating it in Spanish and not speak in english to you. 
She also gives an absurd amount of work and a group project. The directions for the project are extremely vague and confusing, and she grades the project very harshly. She also gives homework in the Grammar text book and grades it very strongly for accuracy, even though she never get over it in class.

There's no attendance grade so nothing really happens, but I would rather study the material independently and wait until the Review for the exam comes out and study from there. This is not to say there's no work! I personally did read some of the chapters in the book because I found them really helpful, and there will be quite a bit of cramming,

Love this man and those glorious sideburns of his. Great course to take as an non-core/non-major credit as a quantitative major.
At first glance you might be intimidated because you see ""Economic and Financial Methods"" as a sustainable development major and you're spooked. This is not the case. The course is quantitive, obviously, but not in a way that is designed to be confusing, nor without the study of real-world implications alongside theory.
The course surveys Economic and Financial methods through the lens of sustainability, but don't misunderstand- the course is not incredibly quantitative. Still, we went through a wide variety of concepts including but not limited to: game theory, financial statements, principles of accounting, and more. I'd say this was more of an applied theory course than a hard accounting, finance, or economics course (and I'm an econ major).
Professor Bose is such a real g. Not only is he incredibly approachable, funny, quirky, but Bose knows his shit cold. Seriously- our discussion went into super-specific tangents ranging from private equity to ramifications of specific carbon-emissions policymaking and he knew every aspect of detail that was relevant. He brought up great examples that were super interesting but still at least tangentially related to the material (kind of). He's sharp, and loves loves LOVES when students participate. 
Honestly one of my favorite classes I've ever taken. Really applicable content too- knowing excel, accounting, and basic game theory is applicable wherever you go in life, and Bose focuses consistently on practical applications of the material. 
The reading and powerpoints contain FAR more information and in-depth content than what you'll be assessed on- focus on the problem sets/review slides he shares as well as the practice midterm and you'll nail the exam. Final project was also a ton of fun. Definitely go to his office hours too- he's willing to talk about anything from topics from class ranging to personal life.

Sonam is an amazing human being and teacher! You definitely have to get used to the way he speaks (a little condescending and never holds back), but if you don't take him too seriously (which he doesn't either) then he's really funny and awesome. He has lots of really critical, interesting things to say about anything he speaks about--Barnard, Columbia, Butler, western culture, the patriarchy, racism. Beyond how amazing and funny he is as a person, I learned so much from this class as a writing seminar. He teaches about transitions, citations, introductions, and general structure of essays in a way that means you can use his instructions for any class. He explains how to use Butler, borrow direct, CLIO--it's truly so helpful. He is so smart, so fun. I don't know how much I can stress how great this class was on so many levels. It really was the most enjoyable class of my semester. Also!! He is always available to schedule meetings--my friend scheduled like 3 every week for a while cause she was so worried about an essay.

This was a mandatory class -- and once in, you couldn't switch. Professor Chun was unreasonably strict compared to other professors of Freshman Seminars. She was quick to mark students absent -- even when they were simply late. She demonstrated little to no flexibility in her approach to teaching first years. 
In terms of the materials -- she was completely uninterested. In fact, she told us on the first day that she found the materials we would read ""boring."" Needless to say the class was boring cause she brought nothing to it. 
Near the end of the semester she repeatedly told us she had not time to meet with us. For a freshman teacher that seemed very strange. I would not recommend her or the class.

Anyways, she posted the lecture notes in advance so I would simply copy them either before or during class. 
Don't get me wrong, I do not in any case regret taking her course. The content is eye-opening and the lab section that goes with it is fantastic (you get to do such relevant and fun labs). 
She also organized several guest lectures which were very interesting.

Professor Durgin is legitimately my favorite professor at Columbia, for a lot of reasons. Let me be clear that this class was far from easy. He will make you work on your craft and he won’t let you get away with bullshit. If you’re the kind of person who is interested in getting away with bullshit, yet have somehow made it to Columbia, I can promise you that you will be writing a review that looks a lot like the one below mine. If not, though, read on. 
The evolution I witnessed in my own writing and, I would venture to say, my concept of my abilities and worth as a person were substantial. This is EXACTLY the kind of class I envisioned myself being a part of when I accepted the admission offer at this school. 
Durgin is charming, funny, interesting, kind, and incredibly passionate about the craft of writing. He will meet you at your level of interest, wherever that level is. I could not have chosen a better or more fulfilling UW experience, in my opinion. 
Tips: do the seemingly meaningless busywork during the progressions. It seems like BS at the time, but it adds to your understanding of the progression goals in meaningful ways. Go to his office hours. As much as possible.  You will be rewarded for it hugely, and you’ll emerge from his class with a great friend and ally on campus.
Take Durgin. You’ll thank me later.

This is a pretty easy class to take to fulfill the Research methods section of poli sci. You learn how to Code R and various research methods used by political science.

So easy. 5 problem sets and attendance make up the entire grade (no midterm, final or paper).

If you're going to take an intro poli sci course, I'd recommend this one. Phillips is a great lecturer and all you have to do is go to lecture to get the info for the tests. The information is really important to know for a poli sci major. Mandatory recitations which, if you get a good TA, basically tell you exactly what to study for the exams. Would recommend this course.

Do not take this course. Literally take ANY other course to fulfill the American politics classes. Erikson is a bad lecturer. Plain and simple, there is rarely any rhyme or reason to why he is lecturing on the topics he is lecturing on. He will sometimes talk about important things but most of the time just talk about random graphs. I will say, he grades very easily. The midterm was graded: A= 100-80%, B= 79-60%, C=59%-40%, etc. But the material is stuff that you learn in both ""Scopes and Methods"" and ""Intro to American Politics"".

Professor Ullman is one of the best professors I've had at Columbia or Barnard. She cares tremendously about her students and provides meticulous feedback on all of your work. 
The content of this class is fairly wide ranging -- we discussed workforce participation, political representation, participation and ideology, and public policy issues around paid family leave and childcare.

This is not a first choice class and I understand why after taking it. Professor Paparella has just started working at Barnard and giving her the benefit of the doubt, I went into her class with an open mind. However, it was a very rough class. Although her expectations are clearly labelled on the syllabus, I cannot stress enough, how chaotic this class was. There are many rough draft assignments for the same big essay and not once, did she give them back in a timely manner. Instead, Professor Paparella staples your drafts to your final, graded draft, which is not helpful in the slightest. She is also a very harsh grader, with the highest score being a B plus on all the papers. The other twelve girls and me were constantly under the stress of not knowing what our grade was, because nothing was given back and she demolishes essays during office hours. This was another terrible aspect of the class: she tells you very close to the deadline that your essay is not good and that you should revise.

Juan Jimenez has been my favorite professor at Columbia. He is so kind and understanding, and he truly wants you to enjoy his class. Juan Jimenez even invited those of us who weren't able to go home for Thanksgiving to his house for his family's Thanksgiving! His goal is to help you learn spanish and have fun doing it, not to trip you up and give you a bad grade. His class will be the least stressful class in your schedule and possibly one of your favorite. In my case, my entire class wants to participate and everyone seemingly has a good time. While I have not gotten my grade back yet, it seems that it is fairly easy to get an A- if you are participating and putting effort into your assignments.
Workload:
2 Compositions: about 350 word papers on interesting subjects, he allows you to get points back if you correct your mistakes (for the first composition)
Occasional MySpanishLab exercises: approximately 3-5 a month, probably the most time consuming assignment in this class
Midterm: very similar to the MySpanishLab exercises, study the vocab from Gente textbook
Final Presentation: given more than enough time to complete this project, present in class for around 6 minutes
Oral Exam: literally a 10 minute informal conversation with another student, and he helps you if you are struggling
Final: have not taken it yet, but I assume it will be very similar to the midterm

Professor Morris is kind of crazy. She's disorganized, her thoughts and comments are sometimes incoherent, and her view points are very extreme. The class is entirely discussion based and most classes are someone in the class giving a presentation/running the discussion, so she just sits on the side and occasionally comments. The professor and most of the students in the class have very extreme viewpoints, so if you like that it's great, if no, it's torture. 
That being said, she is usually an easy grader, if she likes you.

Christina is a wonderful person to converse with about film and about writing film, but not as wonderful a professor. Her lectures tend to be long and only interesting if you have a pre-existing interest in film. Don't expect to have a fire kindled in your heart or anything for the subject matter. I highly encourage you doing lots of reading on your own and watching video essays.
She also highly values participation, so be ready to speak consistently in class.

Professor Brotherton was great. 
His lectures were not exhausting; on the contrary they were very coherent and engaging. He gave us a 5 minute mind break half way through the class which was nice to catch up on note-taking or just relax. 
Lecture slides were posted on Canvas a couple days later. Honestly, his class was so interesting I didn't mind going, but you could always get away with missing a lecture if needed because attendance is not taken. 
The course material is fairly simple and easy to grasp. However, I feel like the basics of psychology still have to be learned at some point so no regrets! 
P.S.: I had a friend taking another intro to psych class at Barnard and they didn't have an essay nor did they have homework. However, I feel like that's a loss because the homework stimulated me to consider the significance of the concepts I was learning with respect to other concepts in psych.

Professor Lozano is INCREDIBLE! I went into this class with terrible expectations because I was not enthusiastic about the topic (it was the only one that fit my schedule). However, I was blown away by Professor Lozano to the point where this class was my favorite this semester. Professor Lozano is engaging, approachable and genuinely a wonderful person. She is incredibly understanding about our other work/commitments and always tries her best to accommodate to your needs as a student (especially with deadlines, which barely exist in her class). The readings are interesting and the discussions in class are even more interesting as a result of Professor Lozano's engaging teaching style. We discussed topics that were very real and relatable and the class in general was very enjoyable. Professor Lozano starts every class asking us how we are/how are weekend was/etc showing how much she truly cares about her students. She constantly made us work in pairs/groups, stimulating a positive collaborative environment in the classroom. My class had students with different levels of Spanish and Professor Lozano was very good about accommodating for these different levels so that nobody felt inferior/superior in the class and so that everybody was comfortable participating in the discussions. If you need/want to take a Spanish class, TAKE IT WITH PROFESSOR LOZANO!!!!

Professor Schor-Haim is the best Professor/teacher/instructor that I have ever had. Although I am not an English/literature person, this class was by far the most enjoyable this semester. Let me start off by saying that Professor Schor-Haim is INCREDIBLY knowledgeable in her field. She is an expert at medieval literature and this really enhanced her class and teaching style. However, she is not arrogant and doesn't impose her ideas on any of her students or make anyone feel uncomfortable about speaking in class. She is very approachable and her feedback on the essay drafts is clear and direct. I always left my meetings with her knowing exactly what I needed to do to succeed. The class itself was super enjoyable and I looked forward to going twice a week. The readings were sometimes long but very interesting so I wasn't bothered by it. I also felt like Professor Schor-Haim was a very fair grader and genuinely a very wonderful and understanding person. If you can, try to take at least one class with Professor Schor-Haim! She will drastically improve your writing skills (even though this wasn't an ""English"" class) and your ability to make educated and significant claims about texts. I LOVE HER!!!!!!

I love Dr. J. He is an incredibly efficient and knowledgeable instructor. His pre-lab lectures are always concise and to the point, meaning that he doesn't bore you with unnecessary content. His eloquence in the lectures demonstrate his extensive knowledge of the topics he teaches. Most people dislike him because he doesn't answer questions in a direct manner. This is true, but he does it to stimulate your own learning and understanding of complex chemical concepts. This for me was very helpful in developing my skills as a chemist. And although he doesn't hand you the answer, he gives you enough hints for you to be able to confidently reach the answer on your own. I always learned more in his pre-lab lectures than in Professor Austin's actual lecture and although Dr. J is harsh, he is still incredibly friendly and approachable. I loved having him as my lab instructor, but I understand that his teaching style isn't for everyone. If you truly love chemistry and are actually interested in the material (instead of just wanting to get an A without learning anything like most pre-med students), then you will learn a lot from Dr. J and will leave the semester with a lot of respect for him as an instructor and as a scientist.

I can't say enough good things about this professor, and I disagree with the other reviewer (I can't believe the reviewer almost discouraged me from taking his class). He is one of the most engaging, energetic, and intelligent professors I've had at this school. Our class discussions are always lively and interesting, and he is extremely clear about the ideas he wants us to take away from the text (and, if you have a hard time understanding, he is happy to take his time thoroughly explaining a concept). He often discusses the texts alongside contemporary legal issues, and I will really miss this aspect of the way he teaches his class. A lot of professors focus on the text without discussing how those ideas apply to the real world - but that's exactly what makes ideas in CC so meaningful and important, and I'm glad that Zach does this. Also, in general, he is nice, approachable, and funny. He can be casual in a way that might rub some people the wrong way (and I see how that can come off the wrong way) but, trust me, he's NOT rude, as the other review makes him seem. He genuinely cares about his students and will always make time for office hours. Yes he is harder than the average (and can grade harshly), but I'm glad I was forced into a section where I couldn't slack - this class and this professor made me fall in love with political theory/philosophy.
Overall, workload is fine, it's just the grading that can be harsh. I know my classmates struggled with their essays. His exams are fair, he won't surprise you with anything that wasn't discussed in class. Take his class!!!

I agree with everything that previous reviews have mentioned about the steel bridge project (namely: lack of clarity about expectations, harsh review regardless). I would like to add by discussing his similar lack of clarity in day-to-day class presentations. 
Professor Panayotidi often spends the class having students flip through pages in building codes as he mumbles on about various minutiae that he expects us to remember for eternity. If a student forgets to bring their book to class, he'll chew them out. Other days he spends the class writing the solution to an example problem on the board, but saying very little about the process as he goes. He might spend five minutes just jotting down math and formulas as we copy along without explanation as to his specific considerations. His examples never properly show the diversity of problems that we may encounter in tests. In other words, there are usually many variations in a type of problem that we are expected to cover, however he never is clear about the differences that we may encounter. 
...Which brings me to the topic of his tests. His tests always include some twist on the class material. The twist is usually something that he might have mentioned once for a few seconds. In other words, even if you thoroughly study the class material and know how to do all of the textbook problems, it is likely that you will take a look at the midterm and final and have absolutely no clue how to do it, because Professor Panayotidi likes to teach students what they don't know via his exams. This testing strategy is completely demoralizing to students. It makes you feel as if you can study Structural Design for ages and still have no grasp of the material. 
Professor Panayotidi is very welcoming and understanding outside of class. If you go see him in his office hours, he is happy to help and further explain the concepts. It is clear that HE MEANS WELL. However, if you ask a question during class related to a topic that he already covered, he might respond by asking why you don't remember it from a previous class or semester. 
I wish I was not so harsh on Professor Panayotidi, but considering that he teaches every structural design class at Columbia, it would be to the great benefit of students if he improved as a professor. From talking to my peers, I know multiple of us that have been steered away from pursing structural design in industry because of our bad experiences with Professor Panayotidi.

Prepare to have any intellectual curiosity you have about race stifled. Like one of the previous reviews, this class is truly a detriment to the educational institution Columbia/Barnard stands for. Manu does not encourage discourse or opinions that are contrary to his own.
I lost track of how many times he said, ""this is the greatest class you will ever take"". How conceited and insecure can one be to say this repeatedly to a 200-student lecture hall? Dial it down.
FACT CHECK if you take this class (which you shouldn't). I couldn't believe how many times I heard Manu misquote ""facts"" or statistics. I've studied immigration policy extensively and during his lectures on the topic, I was shocked at how completely wrong he was about certain policies. Making me doubt the efficacy of the rest of his lectures. It is as if he copy+pastes CNN headlines and uses that as definitive fact to outline his arguments.
He is obviously passionate about the material and that is fantastic, but you should take everything with a grain of salt. I genuinely feel bad for all the students that took (and will take) classes with him and suck down everything he says as unbridled fact.

He both starts and ends class late, he rushes through all of the material and tries to get everything done instead of throughly teaching everything, he doesn't give any examples, he yells at students when they give wrong answers even though he did not teach the material sufficiently, he mislead students about the midterm by making the practice test and problem sets much easier, and so much more.

Tsygankova is an intelligent, nice, and intimidating professor all at the same time. This is the deadliest combination ever, which resulted in lit hum being one of my hardest--yet one of the most beneficial--courses I took at Columbia.
She truly supports a seminar-style class, where she almost talks little-to-none except for opening the conversation and directing what we should be discussing. Other than that, she leaves the room for the class to bring up new ideas, discuss and challenge them, polish them, and arrive at conclusions, all without her intervention. She also maintains the discussion to be heavily text-based; meaning no speculation and broad generalization about human nature, etc..but rather discussions about ideas born within the texts we read.
Tsygankova is a very nice and friendly person. She would occasionally bring sweets and snacks to class, and she makes some delicious banana bread. Whenever you would suggest a discussion point, she truly encourages you and makes you more confident contributing to the discussions.
On the other hand, she is an extremely harsh grader, which has its ups and downs. On one hand, you will have to work really hard to earn one of those B+ essays, but you'll find your level improving at an incredible rate.

The workload was kind of standard of Lit hum, which is by nature heavy. Depending on the text, expect from ~75-250 pages of reading a week. No quizzes or assignments, sometimes just in-class writing assignments at the beginning of the class, but they are relatively easy and just to give you some feedback on how well you're progressing in the course.

Extremely difficult to deal with her, I wish I listened to others who warned me.
You'll be forced to write exactly as she commands. There is no room for creative writing, opinions, or original thoughts. You'll need to write exactly as she wants or it's going to be a nightmare. 
She is not really willing to work with you if she doesn't agree with your arguments and if you aren't willing to change your views.
Office hours were very frustrating. She stares at her phone a lot while pretending to listen, fake smiles and nods as others mentioned. Everyone in my class had strong opinions about her. She really is an awful human being.

Paul Grimstad is a gift from God to Columbia University and the estate of Edgar Allan Poe. His eloquence is unparalleled. His knowledge of American literature is perhaps paralleled, but not possibly exceeded. He has extraordinarily good hair for a middle aged man and wears a canvas blazer with ferocious exactitude. 
Edgar Allan Poe is brilliant in his own regard, but the real value of this course is in Professor Grimstad's ability to bring him to life. By ""bring him to life"" I quite actually mean bring Edgar Allan Poe to life - a few of us met at the Rare Books and Manuscripts library after hours and held a séance, during which a spectre of Poe emerged from the fireplace in the loft, spoke extensively with Grimstad in French, outlined our final papers for us, and dissipated into ash.
This is not any old seminar, because Paul Grimstad is not any old professor. Expect a four credit thrill ride and the word ""denouement"" at least 3x per class.

Masterpieces of Indian Art was an excellent class: entirely straightforward, interesting material, with an insanely low workload. Take it for a quick and painless way to fulfill global core! Dehejia is an exceptional, lucid lecturer, and clearly a star in the field. She was associated with pretty much every site we studied in class in one form or the other, as a scholar or curator, and it was fun to hear her personal anecdotes. Class got a little awkward at points when she’d try and get the students to participate at the end of lecture, but that really wasn’t on her. The midterm and writing assignments were extremely upfront, nothing that tries to trip you up, and all material that was highlighted in lecture, as well as the weekly meetings with the TAs. 
Discussion section with Tara, was one of the highlights of the semester. I’m a senior whose had my fair share of TAs, and I can honestly say she is one of the most talented grad student teachers I’ve ever come across. She is warm, funny, and kind, and incredibly dedicated to the course. She was extremely accommodating with office hours, organized, and clearly worked her butt of to make sure we all understood the material. She obviously loves to teach, and her enthusiasm for the subject made the discussion sections all the more stimulating. I wouldn’t say she’s the easiest grader, she tends to be a little critical on papers and push you to perform to the best of your abilities, but I do expect to land up with an A- in the class, at the very least. 
I 100% recommend taking this class, and Tara’s section if you get the chance! Like so many other reviewers note, you won’t regret it.

Attendance: They pass around a sign-in sheet at lecture/discussion sections. 
Readings: Not too heavy, maybe 50 pages a week? My TA tended to encourage us to do them for discussion section, but you could probably get away by just skimming before exams, if you’re paying attention in lecture and weekly meetings. 
Midterm: Exam made up of straightforward definitions, ids, comparisons. 
Papers: 2 papers on objects at the Met, Buddhist and Hindu sculptures. Would have actually been interesting if we had the chance to write on Indian painting, as we saw so many examples in lecture, but none at the Met.

Aho is apparently retiring, so perhaps this review won't be useful anymore. However, he also tried to retire 2 years ago and is still here, so I'm not really sure what he is doing?
In general, I enjoyed the class. I thought the homeworks in particular were very well thought out – 5 problems, only 5 homeworks per semester and he drops the lowest grade. They neatly covered the concepts and they weren't easy, but they weren't too hard. With some help from office hours, I learned a lot from completing the homeworks, and got good grades on all of them. Aho's office hours are quite good, but the TAs helped a lot as well.
That being said, unfortunately I did feel like I learned a lot more from the homeworks than I did from the class. Aho is not a very engaging lecturer – he talks very slowly in a monotone voice. He also fails to go over very many examples for a lot of the theorems, because they are common sense to him (he is a very Smart Man). I do, however, believe that you can learn to learn from Aho – at the beginning of the semester I felt lost at every lecture, but towards the middle and end I realized that if I attended class and wrote down everything he said, then went over it later for ~30 minutes with the online lecture notes, I could definitely understand the material.
Note: apparently Aho is also the only one who teaches lambda calculus (other than Verma, who is new). Although the subject itself is easy, it is also useless plus it means the rest of the semester is rushed so that he can fit in lambda calculus.
Overall, I would say it is a good course taught by a good professor. However, it seems that the other sections have been taught by amazing professors (Yannakakis, Verma, etc.), so make sure you look at your options but don't feel bad if you get stuck with this one.

Ansaf is nice. That is the best thing I can say about her. I had her for Python last year, and she has improved since then, but her Discrete Math class remains disorganized and frustrating. 
Ansaf has the basic skills of a teacher. She is able to introduce and explain new concepts and provide examples to clarifies what she means. Beyond that, though, she becomes very repetitive. She teaches at an extremely basic level without any breadth or depth. Her lectures could be condensed to fifteen minutes. Her lectures are organized and simple, which made them worth going to rather than just reading the textbook, but not extraordinary or even excellent. 
Ansaf's exams are a nightmare. Not that they're hard - they're actually quite easy, according to the nonexistent curve. Which means that if you make a mistake, there will be no ""safety net"" to catch you. Her exams simply aren't rigorous enough. You need to be careful and achieve perfection.

Much of class time was spent in silence, waiting for someone (him, the TA, one of the students) make a comment that we could run on for the next five minutes. I wasn't happy to be in a class that was so unstructured, and it made it seem like the material I was learning wasn't standardized in any way, but was rather whatever he felt like saying. I did definitely learn objective facts about the construction of musical harmony that were very valuable and made the class worth it, but the particular style of this professor detracted from its efficiency.

I don't even know where to begin with Professor Chauncey... I'll start by saying that I have never written a CULPA review, but I knew it would be an injustice for me not to do so for this class. Professor Chauncey just came with his husband to Columbia from Yale, which is probably why you hadn't heard much of him before. When he taught this class at Yale, it was so large that he had 15 TA's, so that should tell you something about it to begin with.
In regard to the class itself, I will say that this is by far my favorite class at Columbia (and I am a senior). Each of the lectures is incredibly interesting and engaging, and you will learn so many things that you probably knew nothing about or took for granted in the past. Chauncey is at once brilliant, compassionate, and funny. He is cited in almost all of the books he assigns (because he is one of the best in his field), but he is not at all pretentious. He goes out of his way to meet as many of his students as possible, and even offers to meet them for coffee or lunch. One day, he came into our section to observe how the TA's were doing (which I have literally never seen a professor do at this school), and by the end he successfully went around and named everyone in the class.
I also feel it is important to add that this class is not as white-washed or as dismissive of queer/trans identities than its title or description may suggest. Chauncey says from the day one that he makes it a priority to incorporate the stories and histories of queer people of color into the narrative (and he is currently writing a book that aims to do this in the context of New York City), and he does a good job of sticking to this throughout the semester (unlike other professors whose efforts to include PoC into their curriculum are tokenized or minimal). As for trans identities, you will quickly learn that this is an integral part of the course, but that it is simply the words that change throughout history. For example, you will learn that at one point, people assumed gay men or women to be gender inverts.
This is all to say that Professor Chauncey's class is a must-take at Columbia. This is history that everyone should know something about -- whether or not you identity as queer or trans. Chauncey is taking a year off to finish writing his book about queer life in NYC, but when he comes back and teaches this course in Fall 2019, TAKE IT.

Easily my favorite Spanish class of the four I've taken at Columbia. Sonia is an incredible teacher and person, and I cannot recommend her class highly enough.  It was a year for me between Intermediate Spanish I and II, and as someone who is already not good at communicating in Spanish, I was really nervous about this course.  It is completely taught in Spanish and Sonia will almost never communicate in English except to give the definitions of some words or clarify important instructions.  She doesn’t work with the Gente book at all, though some assignments stem from it, and she’s most interested creating an environment where everyone is speaking Spanish with each other.  Sonia worked really hard to make class fun, but even with the relatively relaxed environment, it’s also amazing how much information she managed to transmit, and how much everyone in the class improved over the semester.  She obviously loves her students and makes speaking Spanish fun and low-pressure.

Day-to-day workload is light (usually SBG or completing a handout) but she keeps on top of it so you definitely have to do it.  Assignments include watching movies (always really interesting) outside of class and writing responses.  Final project is going out into a Spanish-speaking neighbourhood and talking with people about a specific topic.  With all essays she’ll help you with two rounds of edits, and will only grade the final draft you send in.  Easy grader, and gets really excited when you care about what you’re writing or try to incorporate the grammatical concepts she’s teaching.  The midterm is hard but I think it’s written by the department because in the essay section she pretty obviously tried to give back points that were lost in the multiple choice section. For the oral portion of the final I think pretty much everyone got an A- or A.  I have't taken the written final yet but am sure it will be similar to the midterm.

Michelle is a genuinely nice professor. She apparently said some intimidating shit to scare people off in the first class. I switched in late, so I wasn't there for that, but in my experience she was not anywhere near a strict professor. 
Her classes go by pretty quickly and I found her to be a pretty nice grader. I handed in some incoherent garbage (I'm in SEAS so I do mean garbage) for the first essay and got a B+, which I could have raised to a B+/A- with a rewrite. Her midterm was also pretty straightforward, I got an A with a reasonable amount of studying. She gives the midterm and final essay questions ahead of time (although she gives more options than will appear on the day of). 
She's a great lecturer, but she's not so great at leading class discussion. She often asks a question fishing for an answer. She frames it as a discussion, but she's clearly looking for a correct answer. It makes it harder to want to jump in when you know that your answer will be brushed off as wrong if it isn't the answer she's looking for. That said, she became a lot more self-aware about it by the end of the semester, which makes it a lot less awkward.

The best Spanish professor I have had at Columbia. She was extremely approachable and easy-going in class, and never made me feel scared to make mistakes. She led fascinating discussions on a variety of difficult topics (immigration, global warming, colonialism and indigenous ideology), and helped make practicing our Spanish fun by framing our activities and discussions around powerful books, movies, articles, and poems. There was less focus on workbook activities and more on discussion, critical thinking, and writing. I was able to devote less time doing busy work for this class, and yet felt that I learned far more than in my previous Spanish classes.

Paulson is a solid Lithum teacher, he's easygoing and seems to actually enjoy speaking with students.  His section is very light on him actually talking though, he seems to prefer just letting the class talk among itself, which is a plus if you're one of those people who likes the sound of their own voice, and a minus if you want a teacher instead of a discussion leader.  He brought food to class and generally has interesting and useful things to say when he actually speaks.  He writes very useful class breakdowns/agendas on the board before every class if you like taking notes.  Pretty average grader talking to my classmates, not overly easy but also not likely to hit you with a C on your first essay.  Would recommend.

10/10 Professor.  If you can get past the whole having to learn Latin part she's extremely knowledgeable and interesting to listen to.  She always has something worth hearing to say, and she leads classes wonderfully and with a great sense of humor.  She assigns a lot of work in this class but that's because it's intensive, not because she sucks. Her grading is actually very generous, but an A is hard to get because of the rapidity of going through the material and the fact that there are concrete goals we have to reach in the class.  I recommend the teacher, not necessarily the class; it would be wonderful to have had her knowledge and spirit in a class where I didn't have to learn basically the entirety of Latin grammar in 1 semester.

I just took this course and let me tell you, EVERYONE should take this before graduation. I am not kidding. When I saw the previous reviews, I went just to meet Professor Mercer, and although she will try to scare off people in the first lecture by showing the amount of work we'll have, its worth it. This course will teach you how to think, how to see things differently, to consider things you've never thought of, to analyze, to challenge, it gives you a different mentality. This class should be a requirement. 
I've never written a review on Culpa, but Professor Mercer is so good that it made me want to write one. I do not understand how this woman does not have a gold nugget on here. She is the best professor I've had in my 4 years at Columbia. She is amazing at explaining philosophy and super complex concepts in a simple manner, repeats things to make sure everyone understands, and includes current events as examples to ground these abstract theories on. The discussion posts really help you understand the material and apply it to your daily life. The papers help you think concisely. It is an amazing amazing amazing class and I wish everyone would take it.

Do not trust these earlier reviews!!! He was the worst teacher I have ever had. The reviews are all from three years ago before Woodbury's ""transformative"" trip to Germany. He now only uses a ""special method"" involving no lectures and spending all of class going over one or two homework problems. Class was not at all relevant to what would be on the tests since he would only focus on 1-2 problems from a 12 problem homework or talk about his research. It was incredibly boring, but if you didn't go you would miss the in class pop quizzes which can kill your grade. Each midterm was absolutely terrible. His midterms are never what you prepare for since he believes you should be ""able to put the pieces together to show you understand."" The homework took forever and was always not relevant to exams.

Absolutely do not take any course with this professor. He is incredibly nice, but his lectures are awful. I attended every lecture, but the slides are all completely useless and this class could be better learnt through youtube tutorials. The coursework is extremely light, with only a couple of homework assignments and a final project. The problem sets can take a little while, so don't push them off until the last minute.
His grading is extremely brutal and his exams don't accurately reflect the course. You're going to have a lot of graduate students with database experience who are going to slaughter the exams, leaving the worst curve I have ever experienced. Many of the people I knew in this class received C's or below despite performing at a seemingly decent level throughout the semester.

Kate is one of the best teachers I've ever had. She passes all the standard tests by which we judge teachers with flying colors. She has great knowledge of the subject material. She is familiar with the Keller & Russell textbook. She is a fair grader, and returns assignments very fast. She is incredibly available: she holds two office hours a week, and schedules extra times to meet with her before big exams or during particularly difficult parts of the course. She gives very personal feedback; she intimately knows each of her students' strengths and weaknesses, and will tell you what to focus on to improve. She is remarkably consistent, and to her credit never let tiredness or personal problems get in the way of her teaching.
Beyond all of that, though, Kate is one of the most passionate and caring instructors I've ever met. She clearly loves Latin, and does her best to share that love with her students. She's a genuinely funny and interesting person, and she will make you want to go to her office hours. Because Columbia gives comparatively so little reward for taking Intensive Elementary (it is worth the same number of credits as the regular Elementary course), the quality of the professor teaching it, and his/her ability to generate enthusiasm for it, is especially important. With a different professor, I could easily have come to see this class as my biggest chore of the week. But because of Kate, even at times that I didn't do the work and knew I would fail a quiz, I still unfailingly looked forward to class. Kate is the kind of teacher that you wouldn't mind getting an F from, just because she's so great.
All of this isn't to say, though, that Kate is just passionate and nice. Her greatest strength comes from her fairness. She knows when to be tough and when to be understanding. She is not afraid to challenge students and call them out when they make avoidable mistakes or arrive to class unprepared. But she never does this in a mean way—she does it because she really cares, and everybody can tell. More than not wanting to fail the course, I ended up not wanting to disappoint Kate.

Wei Min is a very intelligent guy. He's done a lot of work in the field of Physical Chemistry, and through his lectures, you can tell he is extremely passionate about Chemistry. He's super witty and seemed like he wanted us to understand the material. However, at times, this fell short because he has the tendency to go off on tangents and complicate concepts that could've been communicated much simpler. I guess that because he is so distinguished in the field, his explanations, at times, flew over our heads and seemed esoteric. He lectures using Powerpoint but he uses the slides more as a guideline rather than reading straight from the slides. I found it easier to just print out the slides before hand and write notes on that, which many students did as well.
His exams are HARD. Mainly because he doesn't assign any practice problems/ specific areas to concentrate on. He literally just says, ""Do all the chapter problems."" I found it helpful to read the chapters that corresponded to the lecture and do the most challenging problems in the textbook. But sometimes, the exams covered topics that were not deeply covered in the textbook. I recommend going online and finding alternate practice problems that are different/ more in depth than the ones in the textbook, just so you avoid any curveballs in the exam. 
His tests aren't something you can prepare for a few days before. Start studying the chapters immediately after he lectures on them. (I know you guys will probably still try to study the night before, so you will have to learn the hard way)
If you take this course, make sure you pay attention to those small topics he just barely brushes over in lecture, because chances are, 1 or 2 obscure questions related to those topics will be on the test.

Don't leave Columbia before taking Dr. S. Mowshowitz class. You will never (I repeat never) get this chance to dive this deep in immunology. Not in medical school. Not as a PhD immunology student. I'm not exaggerating. I work with immunology PhD students in a lab. Understanding immunology is critical to anything health/medicine related. Dr. Mowshowitz is a walking encyclopedia, a philosopher, and a really nice guy. I challenged star medical students from Johns Hopkins with some of the questions that showed up on my immunology exams and they couldn't figure out the answers... 
The bad: grading is horrible. Exams are graded by undergrads who are busy and don't have time to think if your answers can be right... taking off points because you missed a word that's on the key they were provided... bright people, but not suited for the job (in my opinion).

Humberto is as about as good as it gets for lit hum, I'd imagine.  The workload is very light and he is very lenient with grades.  Just speak up during discussions, have a presence, and you will most certainly be fine.
That's not to say that he lacks as a professor in any way whatsoever.  Humberto is always enthusiastic, has great insight into the texts, and masterfully leads conversation.  He is always considerate and puts a real effort into approaching the books from different perspectives, often providing his own translation for pieces of the English translation he feels lack in properly conveying the original text.  You will come out of class each day with much more than you came in, especially if you put a true effort into participating.

Only one thing to say: do not take this lady's class. First of all, her accent is difficult to understand. While obviously, that is not totally her fault, this fact makes Prof. Urbinati's already meandering and unstructured lectures even more impossible to follow. She jumps from topic to topic without even alerting the class that she is doing so and the lectures seem to have no structure or organization whatsoever, rather they are just her stream of conscious as she reads to us from the texts. Really, I did not learn anything in this class that I couldn't have on my own. 
Secondly, she was completely disengaged from the class. She never had any idea about what the assignments were and on the class before the final, someone asked what the format was and she merely looked confused and motioned for a TA to answer. She didn't even know whether we had a final or a final paper, and it turned out that we had both. According to my TA, she had no part in creating the syllabus and therefore was not as committed to the class as she could have been. This was abundantly clear to me. Every lecture seemed perfunctory and Prof. Urbinati seemed to have no desire to engage with her students. 
Overall, I cannot warn against her class enough.

Professor Broom is, thus far, the best teacher I've had at Columbia across all the disciplines. She is committed, wildly intelligent, and will push you to new limits every time the class meets. She is also a careful reader of your work, and provides incredible feedback that is comprehensive and useful. Nothing feels like busy work in this class. And the readings she gives — about two or three each week — are of a wide variety, including works by James Baldwin, Hilton Als, Jamaica Kincaid, Jo Ann Beard, and many more. Not only were these readings wonderful, but they were also discussed, as Professor Broom would efficiently take us through some of the pieces page by page, or paragraph by paragraph, and show us, in detail, what the writer does to make each moment so affecting. While this sounds tiresome, trust me when I say that Professor Broom is so insightful that these tours are never dull, and they WILL help you grow as a writer. 
You will also go as a critic in this course as well, for a large backbone of the work is centered around reading and writing one page critiques on your classmates' work each week. This is pretty standard for a writing workshop, but Professor Broom puts particular emphasis on the importance of developing this skill.  
The only thing I would say about this course is that it is probably one of the more intense workshops out there. I think it is wonderful for this reason, but if you're looking to get an easy A in a creative writing course, then this is not the one for you. 
Workload:

- Two submissions of 10-20 pages of nonfiction

This class is ridiculous. Many people I know have P/D/Fed by the middle of the course. The beginning of class had over 120 people, and now there's only 58 people left in the course because everyone got the feeling that this would be an utter disaster. I had the same feeling but nonetheless chose to stay, so I guess I can't even complain much.
First, the class is not organized, and Andre goes way beyond what is on the tests during his class lectures. This leaves people extremely confused.
Class average was a 40/70 for the midterm which is 57% ish......
I don't know how else to stress the fact that no one should take this class. Even if you're the smartest person in the world and somehow believe you can meander your way around his confusing material and pull an A....you're wrong. Spend your time somewhere else. Most people I know who are A- to A students in harder Econ classes at Columbia are struggling to get a B+ at this point. I'm not sure who was the delusional reviewer down below who glorified this class and said it was easiest thing out there. Most of us probably got swindled into taking this awful class because of that reviewer.

Sophie Schweiger is a wonderful German professor. Even though I was only enrolled in German Intermediate 1, I felt constantly intellectually stimulated and challenged to succeed. Frau Schweiger was both encouraging and strict, as she constantly expected the most from us while never forgetting to check in on how we were doing. We started class EVERY DAY with a round-the-classroom style discussion (in German) about how our days went. Immediately afterwards, the classroom felt more comfortable.

He always takes questions and responds to them fully, but never compromises disagreeing with you while still respecting the point.

My favorite professor this semester. Professor Franklin has a great sense of humor. She tells the best anecdotes about growing up in Italy and her long career in academia. Best of all, she bears a striking resemblance to Edna Mode from the Incredibles, with her fabulous outfits, glasses, and hair. Her presence is equally as demanding of respect as Edna's.
The class is not so much about grammar as it is about translating real Latin texts. Still, if you have a grammar question, she is very receptive and will take the time to review it. Although she is a master of the language and the history, Professor Franklin is also very considerate of students' ideas, and she frequently asks for input from her (equally knowledgable) TA.
Of course, there is an expectation that you will do the work by preparing translations for the class. When she noticed that some of us were more prepared than others, she began randomly calling on people, which I think worked to the benefit of those who weren't as prepared.
Definitely recommend! Loved her.

CV with Prof. Nayar was a very good course. Prof. Nayar is super clear when explaining confusing topics, and he does so in a very concise way. His lectures have good depth and very large breadth -- by the end of the course I was surprised by the sheer amount of material that we learned. It was intimidating to study hundreds of slides for the final but after finishing the final it was rather gratifying to look back on the amount of material learned.
The homeworks in general were very doable if spaced out evenly throughout the week. The first few homeworks were harder IMO because I wasn't used to MATLAB. But if the concepts make sense in class, the implementation should not be too difficult.
The exams were also not too difficult, no notes or calculators allowed so you can imagine that it can't be very math-intensive. It was purely conceptual with a few math questions or recalling formulas here and there. Overall studying for them was more painful than taking them.

Class was challenging but rewarding. I feel like I learned a substantial amount and can speak intelligently about free speech. The reading material was dense and long, and oftentimes it was not clear what sections of the book we needed to cover. The confusing format of the textbook made it difficult for me to tell what cases were more important than others. 
Classes themselves pretty consistently started with prezbo randomly selecting two students to pick on for the entire class period. Then he would present a hypothetical situation and ask the ""cold-called"" people to analyze the free speech issues. I guess this is a standard law school class format, but I personally wished that prezbo would have done more ""teaching"" himself (rather than relying on students to try to answer the questions). Since classes themselves were sometimes confusing, TA sessions were essential to actually understanding the material. 
I wouldn't take this class if you like to be spoon fed the stuff that is going to be on the exam. There were no assignments whatsoever to prepare us for the 2 exams, meaning that we had to make our own judgements about what would be on the exams and how to study for them.
All that being said, the class was definitely thought-provoking and overall, I am glad that I took it. I don't think that the fact that Prezbo taught it made it any better or worse. I would definitely not recommend someone taking this course just because of Prezbo. Instead, I would say take it if you want to come out of a poli sci course and feel like you actually know something relevant about politics.

Heidi is hands down one of the best French professors that I have had at Columbia. As someone who has struggled with the language but has to finish the program for the language requirement, I've found it very difficult to find a professor willing to go the extra mile to make sure that I understand concepts and the myriad of grammar rules that the language demands. Heidi has been so accommodating and has always offered extra assistance. Her attitude is very sincere and approachable and I appreciate her patience where other professors have displayed frustration. 
While I agree that her accent is quite American, I don't believe it takes away from the course at all. Her intense knowledge of the language more than makes up for it. I found her to be an incredibly engaging professor who is always prepared for class. Class sessions are very well structured and thought out, so if that is an environment that you prefer, she is a great choice. 
In addition to her language knowledge, she also knows a ton about French culture and makes an effort to integrate cultural topics in every lesson whether it be discussing current events or connecting grammar concepts to films and literature beyond just the scope of a typical Intermediate II syllabus. 
I am so happy that I got to have her a as a professor for Intermediate I and II and would whole heartedly recommend her to anyone looking for a professor that is personable, invested in your classroom performance, and knowledgable about the subject. Plus she is just a really cool person.

I took this class with high expectations after reading the glowing CULPA reviews. After taking Homa's class, I can tell that she is a good person with the best intents as a teacher, and probably was at one point a very good teacher when she had more control of the curriculum. However, this class has been the greatest source of my stress this semester, and it is the class I most regret taking. This review should be taken as a review of Homa's intro to economic reasoning CLASS, not of Homa in her other classes.  
The structure and time management in class was very poor. In class, Homa used powerpoints that she hadn't made, and she was clearly very unfamiliar with them. She would breeze through slides saying ""this is all in the book,"" before we could write anything down, let alone grasp the concept. Toward the end of class, she gave up with powerpoints all together, just scrolling through the online textbook projected on the board. Overall, the class always felt disorganized and jumbled. Homa spent a disproportionate amount of class going on tangents about GMOs or factory working conditions in developing countries or Amazon. Although I actually really enjoyed and appreciated her insight on such subjects, the result was that we never learned the actual concepts that we were tested on in class. On the last day of class, Homa tried to race through THREE whole units that we had yet to cover (each unit is supposed to take at least a week,) and these happened to be the units that made up the majority of the final.
The problem sets were excessive and access to to help inside and outside of class was limited. There are problem sets assigned each week, which take an absurd amount of time for only being worth 25% of our grade. The exercises are VERY unclear, and the TA does not help clear it up. In fact, if you go to TA (Hoda's) office hours, you only receive help from  the other confused students, because the TA usually hadn't even read the chapter yet. Going to the professor's office hours instead didn't help, since this semester she assigned the homework the day of and sometimes even AFTER her office hours had taken place.
My biggest problem with this class was THE TEXTBOOK. Homa and some of the other intro to Econ professors started using the CORE this semester as some alternative way to teach Econ. While, in theory, I really do like the idea of learning Econ in a non-traditional way, this textbook does nothing but confuse you and set you up for failure. The textbook explains everything in a very round about way, so that by the end of each chapter, you have no idea what the key terms even mean. Most importantly, the exercises in the CORE were not applications of anything we were tested on for the midterm or final. I might have less complaints if the material we were tested on was as theoretical as the textbook, but the midterm and final were math heavy. 
The class did not end on a good note. The final exam was atrocious. We were given hardly any materials to prepare (only a short practice test that was unlike the final in every way,) and since this textbook is so alternative, you can't easily find practice problems online. So I went back through the entire textbook and re-did every exercise, studying for over a week straight. All of this was in vain, because only one question on the final exam was reasonable based on the material we had practiced in class. I don't even care if there is a curve, (I don't know yet whether there will be,) it is just insulting that I spent so long learning things that I would not be tested on. 
I am writing this review before I have received my final grade, so I'm not even here to complain about my grade. I simply feel that the way the material was presented and the unfairness of how we were assessed in this class was so egregious and caused me so much stress that it doesn't matter what my grade is, I just deeply regret taking this class.

There are four exams total (three midterms and one cumulative final exam). Each is worth 25% of your grade. The required lab course is worth 25% as well. The online Sapling homework (required, and you have to purchase it yourself) is also worth 25%. This adds up to 150% - so two of those 6 grades will drop. Usually, students count two exams, the lab, and the homework. The lab grade must factor into your overall course grade. There is one lab report per week, and takes average 2-5 hours each, depending on the lab.
There are ""modules"" posted on courseworks for every day of class. The module usually contains one or two videos that you are encouraged to watch before class. Each video is about 10 minutes long, give or take. The videos are usually helpful, but sometimes the writing is blurry which can get cumbersome.
The online homework assignments on Sapling are due 1x per week, and are about 25 questions each. I spent an average of 3-5 hours on them. They did help reinforce the conceptual material with detailed quantitative problems. Your lowest two (out of 14 total for the whole semester) will drop in calculating your overall homework grade.
On the syllabus, it states ""exam and semester grades are not curved."" From what I've seen, this is simply not true. The individual exams are definitely not curved (although on one midterm they did add +5 points to everyone's score). However, I received a final course grade of an A-, when by the syllabus' guidelines, I got a B- or low B. Rachel Austin does curve the semester grades, which does benefit students at the end of the semester, but goes completely against her syllabus (and what she has said repeatedly during the semester). In fact, Professor Austin failed to follow the syllabus for the majority of the semester. Assigned textbook readings for each class were listed on the syllabus, and often did not correspond to lecture material at all. The lecture schedule on the syllabus was completely different from what actually happened over the semester. Instead of modifying/updating the syllabus, she continued on lecturing whichever topic she thought should be next - leaving us students unable to prepare for class by doing the readings and studying beforehand. In any course, and especially in STEM, being able to prepare for class is considered to be vitally important to succeeding in the course. By refusing to modify the syllabus, Professor Austin showed complete disrespect towards her students.
Moreover, Professor Austin regularly wasted at least 5 minutes of class time at the beginning of each lecture. There were several occasions where the actual lecture did not start until 10-15 (and a few times, 20+ minutes) after the actual start time. Her lectures are generally helpful, and focus on the conceptual basis for the material with some easy problems. Whenever we were given a problem to work on in small groups, she wasted about 10 minutes per problem walking around the huge lecture hall answering questions, instead of simply putting the explanation on the board. She would often not finish a problem in class, say she would put the solution on courseworks, and never would. She would also repeat problems discussed in the videos (or similar problems with different numbers), which was a waste of everyone's time.
Please do consider taking the chemistry sequence at Columbia. Yes, there are more office hours for Barnard's chemistry course. However, the syllabus is not followed, the course is not structured well, and there is an obvious lack of transparency that results from Professor Austin's policies.

*Now Seyhan Erden. 
Professor Erden is a very kind and approachable professor, and she can competently teach Introduction to Econometrics. However, for Advanced Econometrics, her very presence in the room was harmful. She clearly did not understand most of the material, and during class, she would just copy down information from her slides, not really explaining anything. This would almost be acceptable if what she wrote wasn't riddled with errors. Professor Erden has just about zero attention to detail. I do not know how she has a PhD. Several times each class, students would point out these errors, and eventually convince her she was wrong. But so many were never caught (for example, only giving half of the definition of ergodicity), because the class was so completely lost. Probably the worst professor I have ever had. Sure, it was her first time teaching the course, but she put in no effort to make up for that fact. 
On top of that, the substance of the class itself is pretty challenging. The midterm and final covered more material than any other tests I have ever taken, and with only 5 problem sets, you don't get much opportunity to practice applications. Most of your time will be spent wrapping your head around the theory and derivations. If you enjoyed Intro, are comfortable with Linear Algebra, and are smart, this class is probably worth it. But DO NOT take it if Erden is teaching it.

Wow!
Professor Haider is really wonderful. I am a religion major and signed up for his course as part of the major. I thoroughly enjoyed the course! 
While the workload may seem like a lot, you end up learning a lot. Professor Haider (or his TA in discussion sections) makes sure to address the readings. He is an absolutely incredible lecturer-- Professor Haider has both the ability to explain things with depth and clarity, as well as maintain a high energy level that keeps the class engaged. 
Professor Haider is someone who constantly pushes you to think critically, be it during class discussions or in your weekly response. My writing and my way of approaching sources has changed for the better having been in his class. 
Overall, I highly recommend taking this course! 
Workload:
70-100+ pages of reading a week, along with a written response. Most of my responses ended up being 4-6 pages. You have two free passes a semester (use them wisely!). If you do not use your passes, Professor Haider will drop your lowest two response scores. 
There is a 5-7 page final paper and a project within the first month of class. The project is a creative project, and is rather fun.

If you don’t have time to read this full in-depth review, those 3 letters are the only advise you need when considering this class. Run away from this professor, and never look back. I am serious. While I have been through some pretty shitty classes, all of them have had something of merit. Not this one. For the love of God, just don’t take this class. If this is not enough to persuade you to not take it, let me list a couple of bullet points why you definitely need to stay away from Kolluri and her infamous Calc-Stat course.
How she teaches 
She reads directly from the slides. Now you might think, this aint so bad. No, its bad. The slides she reads off are not even her own, its copied word for word from the textbook, and you all know how boring the textbooks are. Instead being an actual professor and trying to breakdown the concepts so that we all understand it better, she just reads the whole book to the class and expects us to follow on. After about two classes, her voice stops to register and you kind of have to sleepwalk through the class. While you might be thinking, well I’ll just skip the classes all together right, you can’t. (move to the next section)

Mandatory In-class quizzes
I understand why she does it. Without these quizzes I am 100% sure that her classroom would be completely empty everyday of the semester. So to stop this inevitability, her solution is to force us to take a mandatory quiz at the end of each class. The quizzes are easy. Even if you get everything wrong, you still get like 8 out of 10. BUT you still have to drag yourself to a 1 hour and 10 minute class that you know you will learn absolutely nothing. Most people just go on their phones or laptops and burn the hour doing nothing that will contribute to their lives. But come on. That is two and a half hours of your precious week you are burning there. You could watch two House of Cards episodes during that time. Just don’t do it.
How you have to study the materials
Say you made the wrong move and chose to stick with the class, how are you going to study. Well good luck, because the next 4 months of your Stat-calc experience will be you cramming materials that you barely understand, so that you don’t get an F. Statistics is not a fun subject to teach yourself. Take it from me. I am NOT a math-person. And I can only say that I survived this class from the help of the lovely Khan Academy and sleepless nights when I had to fight the urge to go into an existential crisis every 5 minutes.
As a final note: If you are a person who is proficient at math, had a previous education in Statistics and does not care whether you waste their time, as long as they get an A, then sure take this class. If you are the 99.9% people that do not fit in this category, just follow my first advice. RUN

From the opinion of one student who had taken calc AB in high school and another who had only reached pre-calculus, Ila Varma is an incredible professor. Unlike our perception of the rest of the math department, Ila is genuine and realistic in her presentation of concepts. The occasional error (which is always fixed quickly and with amusement) reveals the easygoing nature of the class, while still being stimulating. She has been eager to help students, and has been entirely understanding throughout the semester: this semester she allowed for the final exam grade to replace any of the two midterm exams that it exceeded. For anyone who is looking to fill a math requirement, we heavily stress taking calc I with Ila. She is the best. A great add on is that if you go to lecture, she usually waves when you pass her in the street. TAKE HER CLASS.

Professor Stokes is a funny woman.
Her class is most definitely not difficult, as long as you show up. Professor Stokes doesn't follow any of the textbook's outline for the information and she basically makes her own curriculum. Her class if definitely interesting, she brings in many personal examples for the different topics that this class covers. She grades very fairly, and it is most definitely not hard to get an A. She gives extra credit for every exam, for example. She talks about her past professions A LOT, and how she doesn't need the money she earns from teaching, but if you could get past those two things this class is probably the best option for an Intro.

Yitzhak is the best teacher I ever had for hebrew language. He is nice, understanding, and extremely smart. He teaches the material slowly and clearly, and always makes sure we understand before continuing on. The tests are extremely fair, they're always exactly what we learned in class AND he provides a practice exam beforehand which is extremely similar to the test. He grades fairly, and drops our lowest grade. He is just a great great teacher, and I can honestly say I've learned an insane amount of hebrew compared to before the semester.

TLDR; Interesting material, low workload, awesomely smart professor, but very bad grading practices.
I took this class as my global core elective to complement the Asian lit course I took. You definitely don't need to take an Asian lit but it helped a little bit with some of the artwork connected to literature. The material could either be very interesting or very boring, depends on how into pottery you are, which is half the class. Personally, I found Prof Delbanco very knowledgeable. She really knows what she is teaching, but sometimes this can cause problems. When talking about certain art pieces, it seems like I am not learning to analyze them on my own observations, but hers. When it came time to write an essay or take an exam, if you do not regurgitate the same interpretations as given in lecture as pure fact, you will lose lots of points. In this class, the world of asian art oddly becomes NOT open to interpretation, I was criticized on every single essay because the TA disagreed with my analysis. Making logical points and connecting the dots in your own analysis does not save you!! The TAs are HARSH graders, with very little to justify their grading. I handed in well-thought and polished essays that should have been As, but was given Bs.
For a course that has easy and enjoyable material, it is made artificially difficult through intentionally low grades. The intention of low grades, like other liberal arts courses here, is to incite students to produce better work in the future and show a sense of improvement. My art analysis did get WAY better from this course and I can confidently speak on the subject, but my grades do not show this. If you are thinking about taking this course, don't expect an A. Expect your grade to be low on essays and exams based on arbitrary things. If you don't make the exact same points in your exam essays as outlined in a pre-made answer written by the professor, you will lose points. If your interpretation of a painting or word does not align with theirs, you lose points, even though these things are open to interpretation, the prof and TAs expect you to know specific symbolism on a variety of subjects, some of which are not discussed in class at all. 
Take this class if you :
-don't mind getting a B or a B+. 
-want something with a pretty low workload.
-are interested in the material.
DONT take this class if you:
-cannot regurgitate information
-think art is open to interpretation

Grading tends to be a full letter grade below what you anticipate.

Terry Plank is an amazing professor. Anyone vaguely interested in earth sciences and geochemistry should take her class! Her class is divided up into three sections roughly, planetary synthesis and the early solar system, the formation and differentiation of the solid earth, and the effect of life systems on the earth. It's really cool how you can understand the conditions that make up our Earth at the end of the class! 
She is an excellent lecturer and is often very patient with anyone who has questions. Plus she's a MacArthur Genius Grant Winner! So she's brilliant. You don't need to be hardcore earth science major to take this class although previous experience definitely does help. There are four problem sets and 2 in class exams. Though a great lecturer and a very nice lady, her assignments should not be taken lightly. Definitely dedicate a reasonable amount of time to her class.

Barely prepared for class, assigned weird readings none of us could understand or figure out why we read them, gave us some blatantly incorrect information (about grammar rules, for example), gave higher grades as essays progressed to give the illusion of the class helping our writing, and making up reasons to lower essay grades that he couldn't even explain. Sometimes, he doesn't show up for office hours and when he does, he comes out with bullshit criticisms of your writing that don't make sense and when you press him on it, he can't explain or even takes back his made-up criticisms. It's not a ton of work and you can probably pull a B+ or A- just by writing the four essays. Quality of discussion depend on the people in the class...he resembles competence in leading discussions but sometimes asks nonsensical questions and there's just awkward silence for minutes.

If you're looking to take this class for an easy A, don't do it. This isn't fro sci. It's at 8:40, and attendance is part of your grade. The homeworks are very easy and you shouldn't have a problem getting 100% on them. However, the difficulty of the class lies in all the material that you have to memorize. She posts her powerpoints on Canvas but they're vague and not very helpful - you gotta be there for lecture and take notes so that you actually do well on the exams.

Oh, Ann McDermott. 
Let me start off from what I got in this class, a high B. I had an A- before the final exam. I'm a premed and had other science requirements to fulfill. If you are taking other science-heavy courses with this, it is not easy to get an A.
First off, she makes you hate the word ""lead."" Lead this lead that -- nowhere in the textbook did we learn about ""lead concentration determination in soil of nyc."" If this topic sounds fascinating to you, go ahead and click to enroll. If not, please don't, because :
1. you won't understand what she is talking about
2. you'll find yourself digging through soil and you really have no idea why (except for the sake of participation points that worths 15% of your grade)
3. these seemingly irrelevant topics come up on your exams and tear your soul apart
She is very research-focused, like comments below, and inserts random questions on exams that you've never seen hw assignments or practice exams. At the end of the day, you hate yourself for not being an overly passionate science scholar -- because if you were, you probably asked lots of questions in lectures (that you have no idea what she's saying since she gets distracted easily + you get distracted) and did all the hw problems *and* was so interested in her projects and other textbook-irrelevant chemistry. 
We didn't take this course because we were so interested in your project, professor.
Lastly, she makes it sound like she's doing so much for you by making the participation a free giveaway point in the beginning of the semester. Well, surprise - even if you have a 100% attendance on recitation, you won't get that full 15% of your grade. So, if you are taking this course, please please go to recitations and talk. If you talk and TA thinks you talk a lot - and by a lot, I mean ""ok stop talking I get how amused you are"" a lot - you will get the 15% free.
Each exam had different number of questions. You never know how many there are - they are different from practice exam. The practice exams helped a lot in preparing, though.

Milnor is a really nice person and a great lecturer!  I had her for Reacting to the Past.  The nature of the class doesn't really call for much professor involvement, as the class is student-run.

This is one of the easiest classes I've taken at Columbia! Professor McDermott often goes indepth during the lecture on topics that are not tested on except on the final. The curriculum only covers a few basic chapters of chemistry and is thus significantly easier than AP Chemistry in high school. 
McDermott gives practice exams before each midterm, which are great practice and are almost identical to the real test. Quizzes are identical to homework problems with just a change in numbers, so it's extremely easy to score well in the class.
The class is broken down into 6 sets of 170 points, with the worst set being dropped (totaling to 850 points). Each midterm is 170 points, and the weekly quizzes in recitation combine into 170 points. Your worst quiz of all your quizzes is also dropped! The final counts as 2 sets, and if that is your worst, then it only counts as 1 set for you instead.
I ended up with a 99.8% in the class and I'm a comp sci major, only took honors chemistry in high school, and put much less effort into this class compared to multivariable calc or comp sci. 
Do keep in mind that you will be learning a lot of this material on your own and doing practice on your own, as you don't need to pay attention in class. She has these OWL clicker points, you just have to show up and click a button it doesn't matter if you're right or wrong

This class is very different from standard Calculus classes that you will take/have taken. Professor Youngren puts a lot of emphasis on conceptually understanding the material as opposed to just knowing how to do the problems/regurgitating equations. For a class geared towards engineers and applied scientists, it was surprisingly theoretical and not applied at all. Although Professor Youngren is an enthusiastic and intelligent professor who is very approachable, the reason this class is more difficult is because you get so lost in the basis of the theorems and the proofs during lecture that you come out not knowing what you even learned. 
The second problem with my experience wasn't the professor, but since this is the highest level math class a freshman can place into, the class is filled with mathematical geniuses and students who took the class three years ago, making it very difficult for those who haven't taken the class to keep up. He also doesn't curve your grade as a result, but will shift it up 1-2% to the next highest grade increment if you're close. My 87 was still a B+ after the curve.

Rachel is great! As someone who took Art Hum as a junior, her class makes me regret not exploring art history earlier. We were her 10th+ semester teaching Art Hum and she really has it down (often anticipates our questions/reactions in a funny way, and is very in touch with the student experience). 
Rachel created an environment where I really felt like I could participate even though I had no prior exposure to art history. She basically asks ""what do you notice?"" about each work of art making it easy to speak up. She's great at facilitating conversation, although students really drive it with their raw observations. She also posts her slides after class (although they're mostly images with artist and date) which is nice to look back on for papers. 
The readings were generally short (10-20 pages), but not required to participate well. You do have to write a 1-page double-spaced reading response for each class (part 1 is summary, part 2 is your thoughts/impressions), but these can easily be accomplished by skimming the reading. She grades on a check-minus/check/check-plus basis. I felt like the reading responses were a good way of making us extract the main points without being too onerous. She likes to get student feedback on the reading, especially when it is one she hasn't assigned before or conceptually challenging.
Other than reading responses and participation, the class is entirely paper-based. For the first two papers she gives prompts on specific works (all on display in NYC, and you have to bring a ticket to show you saw it). You have to integrate at least 1 reading in some way, but that makes finding something intelligent to say much easier. For the third paper, you can write about any piece of art on display in NYC as long as you get it approved. She has you submit an outline which she comments on and grades before the final paper is due which is super helpful. She's always very responsive to email and is very accessible during office hours.

In all my years of schooling, this was the single worst experience I have ever had with an instructor or professor. Dieker is weird, strict, terrible at teaching, intellectually arrogant, and a miserable human being. Try taking out a phone in class to see the time, and prepare yourself to be lambasted in front of all the other students. Thinking about going to his office hours for help with his ridiculously long homeworks that are infinitely harder than the material covered in class? Prepare for him to lecture you about how you should handle the responsibility of homework yourself, are inadequately prepared, and he can't help you (lighten the fuck up dude). His exams are just about impossible to finish in the allotted time given the amount of problem solving you have to do, not to mention he does not allow you to bring notes of any kind or a calculator to check your work. 
The sheer amount of memorization you are going to have to do for his exams makes the course truly suck. When will you have to ever have formulas memorized as a professional engineer...when?! During his exams, he splits the class up into two different rooms because he is terrified that one of his students might cheat on his exams (trust issues...) and literally runs back and forth between both rooms inspecting every water bottle on your desk and watch on your hand. Oh, I almost forgot to mention he literally forces students to take their hats off before they enter his midterm and final AND forces you to show your ID...yea, he's that kinda crazy.
All in all, most people who are reading a review about this guy probably have to take one of his classes to fulfill the requirements for their major or a master's degree of some kind. However, IF YOU CAN AVOID THIS CLASS BY ANY MEANS, I ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO SO!!! Dieker sucks in so many ways, and the class will be a frustrating struggle with an absolutely awful professor from start to finish.

His problem sets are a set of 12-15 questions, none of which contain material covered in class. So, you will have to spend a lot of damn time breaking the questions down, talking to classmates, seeing tutors, etc. For the most part, it will be a struggle for you to finish them on your own unless you have had a thorough prior course in possibilities and stats. 
His exams are very, very difficult, and you must study at least 2 weeks in advance. No calculators, watches, or notes (........or hats, or oversized water bottles, or big jackets...ugh).
Just do yourself a really big favor and avoid this human being and any course he teaches for as long as you are a student at Columbia or anywhere else.

They were nice. There were always office hours between each class meeting (Mon/Tue/Fri). I never went. They were good about correspondence with students.
The reviews below this are either scathing or flattering, and I think that neither are fully appropriate for this class and professor. 
Here's what I know, 100%:
- On the first day of class Lax will read off his horrible CULPA reviews and admit that some of them are true (see below).  It's not like you weren't warned.
- Lax's handwriting is atrocious.  You will confuse Y and Z.  There will be extra letters and missing letters and non-letters.  If you can't read something on the board, you're going to have to ask.
- Lax is nice.  Sort of silly, not necessarily funny.  He's available to talk after class, but I don't think he had set office hours.
- Lax can and will talk quickly. It will be confusing if he sprints through a chain of logical if/thens.  Ask him to repeat things slowly. He does tell short silly stories and joke about the class taking bets on how often he will trip and spill coffee. Other reviewers seem to think this is a big deal? 
- Lax will answer your questions in class.  If you have them, you should ask him.
- There is no textbook.  There is only your notes, an occasional handout, and office hours.  If you miss class you will miss something important for an exam.  Either go to class or find a friend who takes excellent notes.
- There is no math. You need to be able to count.
- The class is capped at 100 students.  It was full on day 1 and at 50 students by the end of the drop period. 
- A lot of people struggled in this class.  Smart people took it pass/fail.  It's not everyone's piece of cake. Sometimes, it's not even a matter of going through the logic but of holding large amounts of information in your head at one time or thinking through small technicalities.  
Here's what I think:
- I love this material.  It's interesting and important for anyone interested in election method. It's my sort of thing, and I did really well in the class. 
- I don't think the class is disorganized. The topics build off of each other, especially after the first midterm. 
- Not everything that Lax says and writes down is important. 
- All of Lax's flaws do not make him a terrible teacher.  His saving grace is that he is nice and *will answer your questions*.
- I didn't have a study group. I think that having one would have been really great for compiling (maybe digitalizing) notes.

This class was dreadful for only one reason:  prof. Gaifman.  His utter lack of respect for his students' time showed through week after week.  He was almost always late for lecture, and when he did arrive, he would be completely unprepared and disorganized, and somehow struggled each week to figure out how to use his own laptop and how to lower the projector screen.  He would ALWAYS keep lecturing past the ending time for the class, sometimes by up to 15 minutes.  Readings were typically distributed around 3-3:30am on the morning of lecture, giving students zero time to read in preparation for class.  Assignments were always ""hinted at"" and never concrete, i.e. prof. Gaifman would hint that there would be a midterm paper, but never *actually* assign anything—no prompts, no expectations of content or quantity of work to be done, not even deadlines!  It got so bad that the office of academic affairs had to step in and tell him that if he wants his students to do assignments, then he needs to tell them what the assignment is.  Why it took university administrators to make that point clear to a professor is beyond me.  He assigned the take-home final on the first day of finals week, a total of eight Peano arithmetic proofs.  Then on the second to last day of finals week, he assigned an additional long paper to be written during Christmas, with the consolation that we could submit it via email.  He didn't seem to understand that it's incredibly rude and unprofessional to wait until 3-4 days before Christmas to assign a big research project (university libraries are closed during the holidays) that's due on the 27th.  The bottom line is prof. Gaifman is a very confused and forgetful man who did nothing but cause me undue stress.  I learned *absolutely nothing* from him.
Avoid this professor at all costs.

He would ""graciously"" extend his deadline by three days, forcing us to churn something out for which we had not prepared for.

At first I also thought this course with Professor Stokes was HIGHLY overrated, but (thankfully) I wasn't allowed to drop this class so I was forced to stick it out. For the first 2 weeks or so it is very difficult to follow what's going on in class because it's not explained. However you'll soon realize that your classmates feel the exact same way - no one knows what's going on or what's expected of her - but you will eventually figure it out together. 
I highly recommend taking Reacting To The Past for First-Year Seminar. And of all the Reacting classes, this one is definitely the most chill and enjoyable. You will learn a lot about history and improve your public speaking and writing. And as Professor Stokes will tell you, this is her second career so she truly likes what she does or else she would not do it.
Professor Stokes expects effort, attendance, and respect - all reasonable. She genuinely cares for her students to do well and is a very generous grader. One time we were stressed about an assignment because we all had midterms and Professor Stokes said we can just start a rough draft and not worry about it until the following week.

This is the best class I have ever taken at Columbia so far!
As you'll learn if you take the course, AP is a programming class with a narrative, and Jae constructed the syllabus carefully. It's nice to have a professor who cares so much about the class and the students. He hosts a hackathon with food and the only chance of the semester to work with friends on a homework. Jae is a great lecturer. GO TO LECTURE and ask questions!
The homeworks are called labs, #1-10, and are worth 100, 120, or 150 points each. Pay careful attention to the homework instructions, they are very specific and graded exactly to homework specifications. Best advice is to go to lecture, go to the review sessions, and start the homework early so you can go to office hours before they get super crowded near the homework deadline. If you do this you should be able to get good grades on all the labs. 
Jae is a stickler for academic honesty/no cheating, and it was both the most stressful (when asking friends for help and not wanting to cross the line) and the best part of the course. Since you have to do essentially every part of every lab by myself (besides TA help) my confidence in myself as a programmer grew a ton with every lab.
The exams are ~very~ hard, yet doable. If you stay on top of the material, start reviewing early, and understand what you are programming you can do well. The questions require clear knowledge of C fundamentals, and exams often include at least one question that is incredibly complicated. Exam questions are pretty similar to the types of questions on the sample midterms/finals.
I heard a lot of hype about how horrible and difficult AP was before I took the class. Don't let that scare you, it is totally possible to do well and have fun in this class!

BEST PROFESSOR. I'm happy I trusted CULPA on this one. Daniela De Silva is probably the nicest, most caring professor at this school.
She is actually a fantastic teacher. She teaches the material in a very clear way, is happy to answer questions until everything is clarified, and spends the first 2 minutes of each class summarizing what was taught last class.
She does not want you to stress. She is happy to see you in office hours even for the most trivial Calc I question and will tell you to email her to set up another time to meet if her scheduled hours don't work.
This class is not easy. In my opinion her exams are really difficult, especially the last problem, no matter how much you study. However, she gives partial credit generously and curves the mean of the class to a B+, so it's possible to still do well. Every single one of my classmates had only positive things to say about De Silva because she is a great teacher and really shows she cares about her students. This was my lowest grade of the semester, and I'm not a the biggest fan of 8:40AM classes, but I still recommend taking Calc 3 with Daniela!

This was a horrendous course -- avoid Benezra like the plague.
I signed up for two of Benzra's class in one semester in what might have been one of the greatest academic mistakes of my career. She assumes immediately that everyone in the class is an expert on Marxist theory and the political history of Latin America, which makes her lectures impossible to follow and her long, vague explanations incomprehensible.
Class was a mix of people not having done/completely not understanding what was sometimes long, dense philosophical readings in Spanish and her failing entirely at explaining them or getting lost on some tangential theory of hers that wasn't related to the readings whatsoever.
She was by no means any more helpful in her office hours. She graded quite harshly, and in an attempt to improve, you would go speak to her and talk about your future paper and try and get a handle on what she wanted. Even when walking away with a bulletpoint list of a step-by-step of what she wanted, she still wasn't satisfied with the final product and grades stayed rather static the entire semester.
After spending years in the department and having a pretty good run, I was extremely disappointed with my encounter with Benezra -- LAIC could do so much better.

tons of assigned readings - none are necessary. he covers the readings u need to know in class. no textbook chapters or anything.. just some research articles u can read the abstracts of to understand. (either way, the readings will only be a few points on exams)

Kindness is not a bad thing--it would not have cost Professor Kolbert anything to praise the incredibly good work done by students in this class. She constantly gave unjustified (and unexplained) criticism to myself and my classmates as we gave presentations and completed assignments. There were two times during the entire semester when she gave genuine praise. That was it. I truly do not believe that an entire class of this size was made up of terrible students--this is not narcissism, just statistically unlikely at Barnard. Instead of telling us her expectations throughout the course--and instead of answering genuine questions, she would courtly tell us to consult the syllabus--which was not always comprehensive enough on every assignment, hence our need to ask questions. She never returned any of our written work or provided feedback, so I had (and still have) no sense of how I did in the course, and what I could have done to improve (although, again, she would certainly tell us how terrible we were during in-class presentations). Prof. Kolbert is a busy person, and not generous with her time. I felt every (mandatory) meeting in her office was a bother to her. Overall, she could approach a CLASSROOM environment with smart and excited students with more kindness, willingness to help, and genuine feedback. If this is impossible or too tiring for her, then she should not be a teacher. 
It is required for the Athena Scholars program--had I known that I would only be given recognition for completing the program via my transcript, I would not have participated. This course was useless and stressful, and the program is overall not rewarding or educational beyond the rest of my Barnard career. 
It encouraged me to complete a project that I was passionate about, but I will not be picking up the work again until I graduate, if at all. The course met my expectations in terms of its stressfulness and lack of clarity. I would only recommend this course because I'm assuming it's an easy A, and 4 credits. Otherwise, I gained nothing new from it--there was no real teaching being done--and I feel like I wasted a tremendous amount of time listening to my equally disillusioned classmates explain their projects throughout the semester and be criticized. This class certainly creates a sense of camaraderie in that we all disliked it.
More clarity in expectations for individual projects (beyond the syllabus). Literally any amount of feedback on our work. More teaching of new material that can help us with the project--the highlight of the course was a guest lecture by Jehmu Greene, which was the only point at which we were taught anything new, and one of the only times we were engaged. j.coats@phalanxsystems.com

Christian was obviously extremely knowledgable, and when he lectured it was interesting and exciting, because he clearly loved what he was talking about. He made himself available twice a week, which was also helpful.
Christian had extremely incorrect expectations of his students. This is a course for environmental and urban studies majors with limited math and science experience, yet he expected us to be mathematicians like himself. The math used in the course was fairly simple, but the problems came when we did have questions that he coyly refused to answer during his office hours or during class. His attitude was dismissive and plainly unhelpful. Expectations for different problem sets were not well explained, and there were many times that homework questions were not even touched upon during class lectures, making them impossible to answer without consulting the Internet, which certainly would not have one clear explanation that would align with Christian's expectation for the correct answer. I have no suggestions here, but student participation was very low and difficult to drum up in the class--perhaps because of its size and our limited time in the classroom. Overall, Christian could approach different students with more empathy for their knowledge backgrounds, and be more generous with his help. 
Cynthia is also a very passionate person, and an incredibly talented scholar. It was an honor to learn from her, and I wish I had more time in the classroom with her. She communicates with enthusiasm and joy, even during the most depressing class discussions. Cynthia was great at answering direct questions and tried her best to engage us.
Cynthia's lectures were surprisingly unstimulating, for such a brilliant person. She read off the slides and didn't offer much more information beyond what was written on them. There wasn't anything she covered that couldn't be found in the readings. I was so disappointed and confused by this! Again, I don't know why class participation was abysmal in the course. Her feedback on work was unhelpful when we did receive it. A peer of mine had Cynthia (as opposed to Christian or Ella, the TA) grade her first draft of the final paper, and Cynthia gave her a D even though it was comparable to my own work--it seemed her standards (and their collective use of a rubric) were arbitrary, and my peer said Cynthia's comments were vague and unhelpful, especially given the grade my peer received. More time with Cynthia would have been great. If she spent more time speaking off the cuff about her work and how it related to the class during her lectures, I'm sure it would have been marvelous.
It was a course I have wanted to take since I join my major two years ago. I'm personally interested in agriculture, and there are very few course on it at Columbia and Barnard, so this was an exciting opportunity. The professors both work at NASA, which is impressive. It also fulfills a major requirement for my program, but it was one I had previously completed. 
I learned very little overall, but almost everything I did learn was new and interesting. It met none of my expectations, because I had none, but somehow I was still disappointed. I would recommend this class if it were better than it is now, because it is a very valuable course, and, again, nothing else similar is offered for undergraduates. In its current state, I would not recommend this course, because I learned very little for a number of reasons, listed below. 
I can't emphasize enough how poor the clarity of grading standards were! This is the most frustrating thing about the class. The professors decided halfway through to become more lax in their grading scheme. There was an overall lack of cohesion in the flow of assignments, what was expected of us, and literally how to do homework assignments. The class would be served better if it met more often. There was definitely not enough time in each meeting for all that the professors were trying to get done. If we met twice a week it would be easier to have full meetings with our presentation groups, complete discussions and actually have time to talk as a class, and hear full lectures and be able to ask questions. I think all of this would make a HUGE difference in the quality of the class.

Absolutely fantastic! He really knows his stuff. He's also quite a bit more meticulous than previous professors I've had, but I don't think that hurts the class in any way. It's small things like keeping really careful track of time, but also putting a ridiculous amount of work into providing resources for everything: from class repertoire, to his own study/homework guides/analyses, to assignment structure, to generous submission feedback. He planned the class to align two of the central pieces we analysed with a New York Philharmonic performance that he organized a trip to. On the last day of class, he even got a living, breathing composer to come in to talk about their work! 
The syllabus is a little intimidating, what with the amount of content and the preface on his approach to the class (which is a little more formal than what I'm used to), but nonetheless he lectures and leads discussion with incredible humility, openness, and respect. This semester, he experimented a bit with daily exercises in ear training and basic theory/notation, which was a bit of a grind but definitely helpful for making the most out of class work. He's also extremely receptive to feedback about class or his teaching, to the point where many of our comments he incorporated into the structure of the final exam. Generally, he's more than happy to discuss or help with anything music/theory/class/pedagogy-related after class or through email, and I would highly recommend taking the opportunity to chat with him! This was my favourite theory class at Columbia, and I think it really made me grow as a musician.

Grade-wise, you'll get full credit if you do the assignments/activities in good faith. Load was probably no more than with previous theory classes, though significantly less stressful.
This was the rough breakdown for our semester, but it may very well change:
25% - Final exam. Review of topics and repertoire, through listening IDs, exercises, and analyses (some unseen, some seen), all very guided. It's not supposed to be super stressful, but just to encourage you to review the semester, and he provides plenty of study material. It ended up being very reasonable.
39% - 1% to attend each class
24% - 2% for completing each of the ~12 assignments (pretty consistent in workload; a mix of analysis, short composition, and exercises)
12% - 1% for each listening session contribution (for us, it was finding a piece that matched some weekly theme and introducing it in class)

I would disagree on several key points with the last reviewer. At least in my experience, when there were only 24 people in the class, this course wasn’t a sleeper easy A, given less than 12 people in the class can receive A-range.
Further, Wojciech does release Problem Set solutions, and he also provides copious practice problems before the final (with solutions) which serve as great study guides. His Problem Sets are very well-designed, in that they really provide understanding the underlying model of whatever topic is being addressed in the PSet.
The midterm and final were relatively straightforward and similar to practice problems. One issue, however, was that the averages for the exams were actually too “high” (around 85-90%). One mistake moves you back substantially in the pack. Nevertheless, it’s good to know you don’t have to kill yourself studying for these exams.
I personally enjoyed Wojiech's class because of the content he focused on. The second half the class focuses entirely on taxation, which was exciting because the class coincided with the tax reform bill so you could really understand the details of what was happening in Congress. However, for the two months, you are not working out of a textbook, so the lecture slides are all you have to rely on. Nevertheless, he knows tax policy extremely well (he’s recognized among fellow economists as a top scholar of taxation), so he teaches the course to his strength.
Wojiech is generally a nice guy in office hours, he’s willing to talk about class material or other topics. However, he is a slow lecturer and doesn’t manage time well. This meant he had to continually revise his lecture schedule and occasionally drop lecture topics altogether. However, he’s very good in that he always posts slides ahead of time.
My last comment is that if you have the choice of taking Wojciech or Francois Gerard for Public (in different semesters), take Wojciech. The main differences are the following: Wojciech takes a special focus on taxes, Gerard on healthcare. Gerard’s PSets ask you to read academic papers and don’t relate well to the exams. Lastly, Gerard is very rude and not easy to talk to during office hours (I took Gerard’s class for three weeks last year).

I found Professor Hayashi's class, interesting, eye-opening, and informative. We ventured through approximately eight authors over the course of the semester. Meeting once a week and covering the material in class via student interpretations and discussion led by Professor Hayashi. 
He leads by posing questions and making observations, in this manner I found myself questioning long-held beliefs. Much to my benefit, he was happy to allow all of us to make as many mistakes as we needed as we stumbled along to understanding these works.
Some of the readings were at times difficult to follow, typically due to neologisms. I learned to rely on some interpretations of the texts to eliminate or reduce the learning curve.
He scored us on class participation and two papers, with the final paper worth 40% of the grade.
He tended to grade on theory uptake more than on some of the minutia other professors focus on.

Do NOT take this course - at least not while Elizabeth Hess teaches it. The title and course description suggest an in-depth look at Shakespeare and the different techniques that can be employed in the modern day performance of it. This is misleading and deceptive. Not only is there absolutely no structure, but there is also very little actual instruction regarding Shakespeare given.
Elizabeth disregards the syllabus completely, giving vague descriptions of assignments, and then getting upset when students fail to meet the specific aspects she demands. It is not only frustrating, but also anxiety-inducing. It is clear that she is a new instructor in the department, as the concept of grading is lost on her. Despite turning in multiple typed assignments as well as performing scenes, we received NO GRADES the entire semester.
This is a four hour per week class, and two of the hours are spent on frivolous ""exercises"" that bear no semblance to Shakespeare or even really performing in general. I am familiar with the concept of theatre warm-ups and exercises and believe that those are quite beneficial, but the ""exercises"" done in Elizabeth's class are certainly not these and prove to be a waste of time.
Elizabeth herself creates a rather unprofessional and unwelcoming environment for performance. She frequently asks actors to do things that they are clearly not comfortable with, and makes an alarming number of sexual comments throughout every single class.
This course, in theory, has the potential to be extremely stimulating and intellectual, but until a more competent professor takes its reins, steer clear.

The exams are 120 points each and you have two of them. They are a combination of MC, short answers, and long answers. MC are tricky and sometimes aren't straightforward. The short answers are just memorization. The long answers (make up more than 1/2 the exam) present the context of what you learned in lectures in a new way. This often throws off many people, speaking of experience, so our study group posed critical questions and we tried to answer them. Like: how many H+ would pump into the innermem space by 1 NADH+H+ when the malate-asparte shuttle failed? Plus you are allowed to bring a card filled with the pathways so you don't necessarily have to memorize them. There is always a chimera problem where he shows an enzyme site and you have to decipher the puzzle by recognizing amino acids, and redrawing the substrate. Then some form of a mechanism problem. Don't worry if you have never seen the mechanism because it isn't expected but know a general pattern. When we studied in our group, we looked at for example how oxaloacetate becomes PEP. We asked was a there a theme in the mechanisms - for instance phosphorylation by ATP (commonly tested), dehydration to form an alkene, etc. The final exam was somewhat easier (meaning less curve). The previous reviewer on testing diseases on the final is true - you are resposible for 13 diseases - biochemical basis and treatment - but honestly not hard and most just cram it into the card anyway.
Research Project
We took this lightly and did really poorly. He grades really harsh. We lost points for content and formating because our font size fell below 12. Really that's about it. Our group had people on the brink of an A/A- and it was just upsetting. So follow the directions closely and please use appropriate FONT and SIZE!
Quizzes
Every class you have this 10 point quiz and is really annoying. Sometimes they are nit-picky specific and sometimes its like a walk-in-the-park. But you get to drop 2. Do well on the 1st few weeks they only get harder.
Trivia
Bonus! Just as you would expect! This was an awesome end to the biochemistry really showed how far we came from our 1st day.
The class does take a lot of work. I struggled in the class but ended with an A just by having near perfect HW/quiz/and good exam 2 score. I did average on the exam 1 and the final and was fine - with a poor research project (B-). Be ware he does not curve the class but curves the exams. So there is a curve sort-of. You see if the class average is 67% then instead of making the exam worth 120 pts (80.4/120) he makes it worth 100 points (80.4/100) to make the average 80%. nam doesn't realize that in doing so the exam now contributes less to your overall score (he needs to rescale the score to 120). The class is total points so again do well on the HW, it adds up to an exam, same goes for the quizzes (roughly 1 exam).

Professor Suarez-Garcia deserves a gold nugget. I had the pleasure of taking him this past semester, and the man was absolutely amazing. He truly cares about his job and does everything in his power to help all of his students master the language. He is always available to speak outside of class...and does more than most teachers will do for a student. Can't remember a teacher who was this good at his job. Anyway, if you care about your grade...you'll get a good one. I'm sure most people in the class had a grade in the A-range (I got an A+).

Don't be FOOLED by the reviews! The course is different from the reviews. Now the course consists only the projects. The lecture weren't that helpful for the projects. And the way she grade the project is by the number of test cases. If you made everything right, you will get 100. But if you messed up with one tiny thing, you will get a super low grade. So the grading cannot show the understanding and effort fairly. Most of the projects were frustrating.

Disclaimer: I went to two classes total.
I can't speak to his teaching style, but Dr. Bauer organized and designed the class very well. The coding exercises on the homework were generally simple and easy. For the programs that required a little more thought, Bauer provided skeleton code that tended to trivialize the problem. The midterms and final were fair. The tests both consisted of 
A few true/false that required you to know some small nuances of the python language. A few short answer about interpreting code.
1-3 simple coding exercise that required only basic control structures. 
Honestly,if you don't need this course as a requirement, you should just teach yourself the material. Otherwise, it's still a solid class to leisurely learn the bare basics of python. 
Also, his lecture notes contain everything you need to know.

Professor Schor-Haim is a brilliant and compassionate woman, who truly cares about her students and wants them to thrive in and out of the classroom. She is incredibly helpful during office hours and genuinely wants to help you. Sometimes she was flaky about scheduling things and gave us a few (very small) assignments at the last minute but she was totally understanding if you couldn't get an assignment done. Also, classes really only focused on that day's material so bigger items on the syllabus could sneak up on you. Just pay attention. Her compassion made her a wonderful professor to have during my first semester because I felt very overwhelmed by the high school to college transition anyway, but her kindness helped a lot. 
She also designed this curriculum herself and is really passionate and knowledgeable about the historical contexts as well as the texts themselves. This class talked a lot about gender roles and harmful stereotypes about women (spoiler alert: witches aren't real. Men accused ambitious and sexual women of being witches because they felt threatened) which is what I was really into. The texts ranged from ancient Sumer culture all the way through western fairy tales and modern feminist theory. We also got to see Wicked, with Barnard paying for our tickets. 
This was one of my favorite classes!! Take it. You won't regret it.

tldr: this class was nothing like the previous reviews. the lectures are useless for the projects. the projects are insanely hard for no good reason. martha kim was not caring like some previous reviews mentioned but seemed to gain pleasure from giving people 0s on projects. the curve is bad. she might change, since this semester seemed like an outlier, but i personally had the worst educational experience in my academic career so far and i would not recommend this class to anyone.
here is a list of things that i felt was wrong with this class:
1. first four of the six projects all have super high average (around 90). if you mess up on any small thing, even something she did not mention in the prompt, there is a high chance that you will get a very low score, including 0. for instance, in one project she first gave some people 0 out of 100 for not having the correct reset behavior but otherwise perfect circuits. she did not mention anything about the reset behavior in the prompt, and so later gave these people 80. there are many other examples where people turned in the circuit thinking they have a functional design, but because of her failure to fully describe the specifications, ended up being surprised by poor scores.
2. there are so many specifications you need to meet. if you fail to meet any one of them, you get a 0 regardless how else you have demonstrated what you learned in this class. while some might argue this is how things are done in the “real world”, but i think for a class where each project weighs about 1/6 of the entire course grade, giving out 0 out of 100 so easily is seriously wrong.
3. the later 2 projects are supposed to separate people, so it’s about how well you can optimize. here’s a quick fact: about 1/3 of the class got 0 out of a 100 on project 5. the averages and medians are really low for both of these two projects. i spent five days straight working exclusively on this project, and ended up being right above the average. i never worked so hard on any school project ever. i know at least four other friends who worked even harder and received poor grades. it’s really not about how hard you work.
4. project 6 was due on the THURSDAY OF READINGS WEEK, just a week after project 5 was due. because these two projects were so hard and took so much of my time, i was not as prepared for the finals as i should have been. i’m not sure if that was even allowed, but it was a real pain in the ass when you are trying to study for other finals but had to be stuck with two hardest fundies projects of the semester.
5. sure there are people in this class who are very passionate about the material and spend a lot of time on the projects. but based on the experiences of most people i know in this class, they are taking this class only because its in the CS core. most people will never touch these stuff again and absolutely do not have interest in the low-level stuff. this class definitely failed in both properly introducing people to the field and giving people a general idea of how things work under the hood, given how difficult the projects are. what people learned in class is virtually useless, which defeats the purpose of projects.
6. the TAs are literally incompetent. i went to many office hours and one time for project 5 the TA told me the completely wrong idea, which is later corrected by another TA (Tom, who seemed to be the only legit one). i feel like most of the time their lack of knowledge and/or poor ability to teach only confused the students even more.
7. Martha Kim is nothing like what the previous reviews said. she did not postpone a project due during midterm week, which is fair i guess. but scheduling projects 5 and 6 so close to each other and one in readings week was a huge fuck up. students really suouldn’t be penalized for her own poor ability to schedule things properly. in addition, like i said the numerous specifications make you think that she loves giving out 0s to people and see them suffer, as demonstrated by ~60 zeros for project 5.
8. curve??? i got basically perfect on the first four projects and 50ish on the later two, which are all above average, and i got a B?? based on my experience with the CS classes, i was expecting an A or A-...
this class was a total nightmare, and i just hope that i will never touch anything lower than C and see Matha Kim again.

This course has changed from previous years, apparently. I have never seen students put in so much work for a class and get such little return on their investment in terms of grades. This class does not account for effort in any shape or form. The tests she designs to test your circuit are at best surface level and the TAs don't even glance at your circuit to see how hard you tried. Obviously I'm not a circuit engineer but I can see merit in awarding students points for at least building the underlying functionality associated with the prompt even if it doesn't pass the most ridiculous handshake tests. 
There were 6 projects in Fall 2017, with the first 4 being doable and the last 2 extremely difficult. Mental health goes out the window because the last project was due in the middle of reading week, and takes up to 40 hours for the average student with testing, OH, and talking to other students. Because there were 6 projects, they didn't have a lot of spacing between them, especially towards the end of the semester. There isn't a lot of space given if you slip up--there's like 3 late days for the entire semester and only 2 can be used per project. 
Also there's very little point going to class, the material is in no way related to your understanding of the prompts. If you want to learn about the field and what a processor looks like etc, then go. She was a pleasant lecturer, and answered questions in class. Before the due date of every assignment, she would do a 5 minute quick review of the prompt which was helpful sometimes. 
Hope this course changes/becomes a little more of a modern discussion and application based class. Best of luck to others!

This course is not easy, and Jae will not hold your hand. He will expect you to keep up and master everything that he covers in class. Do the readings as they're assigned, at least the required ones; if you don't, you will most likely fall behind.
Jae's lectures go by quickly, so make sure you take notes quickly or have recordings for backup (usually if you ask the listserv for recordings, someone will have one). You want to use a combination of hand-written and typed notes because he talks fast and writes a lot of code and diagrams on the board.
The labs are not terribly difficult but they can take time if you want to make sure your program(s) work exactly as instructed.
The exams ... oh boy ... The averages are typically in the 40s-50s, with even lower medians, but the curve is generous (but not that generous). In Jae's words, ""if the average is a 40, then a 50 is good"" (but of course it's not). Aim for a 60-70 exam average for an A- and 75+ exam average if you want an A (assuming your labs are perfect or near perfect). The exams account for 75% of your grade, so they're a huge part of your grade.
The TAs can be a mixed bunch, so choose your favorite(s) and they will help you succeed on the labs.
If you want to do well in AP, I suggest you
- allocate 15-20 hours a week for it; if you feel like there's nothing left to be done for the week, you're wrong.
- take a good set of lecture notes (Jae's notes are just a skeleton); review them regularly
- do and REDO every one of Jae's practice exams - this is critical!  You should ask a friend to grade them (if you have friends).
- go to office hours regularly - you are bound to have questions while studying. Each week, I collected a list of questions to ask the TAs or Jae.
- talk to the TAs about the labs. they will give you hints. More often than not they will indirectly tell you exactly what you need to do or how to approach a problem. Ten minutes during office hours can save you hours in the library.

Workload:
10-20 hours a week, depending on the difficulty of the lab and amount of reading assigned. Not terrible if you use your time efficiently.

Martha is a great lecturer. When she speaks in class it's generally very easy to follow and the subject material is always very interesting so it's easy to be engaged. She's also very good about taking questions and stopping and going back to review places where people have indicated confusion. The same goes for her office hours. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND going to her office hours. Even if the people there have questions that you're already clear on it's always illuminating listening to her explain concepts. She really goes out of her way to try and help the students that come to her office hours. Like, I've been there at its peak where there are 20+ people in a small office space and she's taking questions and explaining them painstakingly and patiently or she's on her knees since she's offered all her chairs to her students and she's reading a massive circuit to try and troubleshoot some edge-case bug. Truly, she's a great professor.
That being said, the way the class is organized is a bit uncomfy. The project-orientedness is nothing new for a CS class but the way that they're graded can leave a lot of work unrewarded. At the very least, it's all entirely objective for better or for worse. The good news is you can typically accurately calculate what you're going to get. The bad news is it's very hard to argue a better score later. Any distribution in score comes from optimization whether it's from gate count or CPI. However, if you fail her entry cases it comes to a 0 regardless of how close you got or the optimization algorithm beyond it. Coming very close to having a working circuit and submitting an empty file will get you the same score which is something that's really harsh.
The first 4 projects ranged from easy to doable; averages were in the 90s. The distribution really came from the final 2 projects that were centered around CPI optimization so the averages were in the 60-70 range. 
All this being said, I still highly recommend this class with Martha. Even though the grading scheme feels a little unfair at times, you really do learn a lot from a great professor. Also, so long as you get a working circuit that passes her entry cases you don't have to worry about getting a 0. The material forces you to think critically and is very engaging. I found even when I wasn't working on the projects I wished that I were.

Professor Verma's ML section was definitely worthwhile. He's a clear lecturer and gave homework that really helped further develop the concepts we learn in class. But, be warned that the homework was difficult and time consuming, though this is somewhat mitigated by the fact that he allows students to form groups of 3 to work on homework together.
Tests were a mix of very easy questions and a couple rather hard questions. Some of the more in-depth math was fortunately not tested on exams, but there were some difficult theoretical problems. Overall, particularly with the curve, the tests were definitely manageable.
Personality wise, Prof. Verma is great. He cracks jokes during lecture and he really cares about his students. His OH often seemed to extend passed the slotted time so that he could continue to help students. His niceness was a bit of a drawback at times in that some students would occasionally eat up a lot of lecture asking basic or unnecessarily involved questions and he wouldn't cut them off, but he got better at handling this as the semester progressed.
Overall, this was a good course that'll teach you ML basics, but it will probably be one of the heavier workload courses you'll take in a semester.

Please trust the reviews dating all the way to the early 2000s - Herbert Terrace is the reason that tenure should be abolished.
The class contains little more information than did Science of Psychology. Actually, that's not true; now I know what the field of psychology was working through in the 1990s, because that's the last time Terrace bothered to update any of his course materials.
Ironically enough, he doesn't even update the information he has on human evolution, despite that being a central unit of the course. And even the information he does have misrepresents the most widely accepted theories of evolution. The readings are (still!!) mostly drawn from the textbook manuscript he's been trying to publish since 1999. Spoiler alert, Herb: nobody's gonna publish it!
Terrace is condescending and rude to students during class. He often interrupts people while they answer his questions, or simply chuckles at their answer and provides no response to them. But if you simply repeat verbatim what he said, you'll get a smug smile and a knowing, dry sip of his morning Fresca soda.
The tests were maybe the most frustrating part of the class. The questions are still poorly worded and intentionally try to trick you with arcane syntax and multiple correct answers. It's clear that Terrace doesn't want to test your knowledge but test your ability to regurgitate his idiosyncratic material exactly as he teaches it. Two students during a test had to go argue with the TA (since Terrace doesn't even bother to come on test days) about a question on human evolution.
Also, if you're interested in the class because of Nim Chimpsky, don't waste your time. First, watch the movie. No need to listen to Terrace moan about having to raise a chimp in groundbreaking research, then completely throw out the results. Spoiler Alert: Terrace ended the experiment and the chimp ended up in pharmaceutical research being sedated and injected. Terrace didn't even bother to say goodbye to an animal that he raised as a human child.
Dear Herb: if you're reading this, do everyone a favor and retire so the Psych department can hire an actual scientist and professor.
