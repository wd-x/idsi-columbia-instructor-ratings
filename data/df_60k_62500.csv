I see that no one has reviewed Professor Hertz in a while and I think he deserves a good review. I am 99% sure I am a Biology major. In high school, I had very bad experiences with science teachers... So we can say that my preparation was not the best, although you are expected to have a solid background to succeed in the 1500 level course. My not-so-good preparation has been just enough. 
Professor Hertz is great. He KNOWS what he is talking about (he is one of the authors of the textbook). He makes his lectures easy to follow by providing us pre-made (by HIM) outlines and we only have to fill them in. He  tells you exactly what chapters (and sometimes even what certain pages in that chapter) you need to read to be prepared for that lecture and consequently, to be prepared for the exam. He does question periods like 2 weeks before the exams. He is very open to questions from students during this period but not during lecture because lectures are HUGE. ... So his lectures are great. They can become boring at the end of the semester because it is the same style of teaching all semester long. But whatever! Everything he says helps your understanding of the material. Besides, exams are mostly based on lectures and less based on the textbook. 
The most annoying part is the weekly online homeworks. They are so long and you actually need to read the textbook to answer the questions in the Aplia portal. I hate doing this, but it will certainly help your grade at the end if you do them NOT-carelessly. Besides this, you have the option of doing online quizzes posted on Courseworks for bonus points. He says it doesn't matter what your score is. You just do the *optional* quizzes and you get bonus points at the end. No one really knows how much these bonus points help you... Bust JUST DO IT. 
All in all, Professor Hertz is very smart!!! I'm not saying I will be a Bio major because of him. That would be a lie. But I will say that he does make the course a liiiiittle more easy going than it would otherwise be. Bio will always be tough... Especially the 1500 level, so don't expect to be completely prepared for what is to come in this intro course.

Avoid at all costs. He is arrogant, lazy, and not very smart. He'll give you dumbed down lectures , saying things about comic books that my grandma could come up with. Ignores anything interesting or even a little controversial (he had a really difficult time talking about race and gender in graphic novels, for example, even though we were reading great material like March and Fun Home--maybe because he doesn't think about these things?). I also got a pretty sexist vibe from him and he was very condescending in office hours. Maybe jocks have had other experiences. But especially in a class like the American graphic novel where you teach sensitive material about gender and sexuality, you should be aware that these things are issues! 
He's also a really bad communicator, never clarified assignments, pushed around deadlines and skipped lectures or replaced them with bullisht ""discussion sections."" Everyone was so confused in this class! Even the other professor and TAs who were really sweet, seemed fed up with this guy.

This class was amazing. The professor has a way of breaking down complicated concepts, which not only makes you feel smart for understanding but gives you confidence to attempt to understand others. Who knew I would be able to calculate orbital periods of planets after the end of this course? Certainly not I! Seriously though, the class gave me a good working basic knowledge about the Earth, Moon and Planets which comes in handy every day. Every time I watch a science fiction movie about the solar system, this comes to mind. Articles about satellites and the discovery of Earth like planets, which are always on the news are no longer intelligible. The professor is also very approachable in the class but also office hours. I recommend this class to all. You won't regret taking it. (I am not a science major, took this as part of my Core)

Heidi comes across as extremely nice during the first few weeks of class (aka shopping period), but then she becomes extremely passive agressive towards the class. Her exams are extremely difficult, both to prepare for and to take. The majority of class will be going over literature, but the bulk of the test will be grammar, barely discussed in class. Plus, this is the class where your accent will come to die. While Heidi definitely has a fantastic grasp of French grammar, her American prononciation of all words forces you and the rest of the class to care less. There is a serious lack of organization and communication.

This class is just time consuming. It isn't hard to get a decent grade in, per se, because the math isn't hard and because you have homework assignments that bring it up no matter what. I didn't study for the exam and got a C, but with the HWs I was able to pick up my grade to a A-. The class gives you a chance to think in a really interesting way in terms of statistics, Professor Donoghue really cares about how you do and what you're taking away from his class, and it's a fair class. Those are the positives. The homework is quite time consuming. Like others have said, even with the time-consuming hw assignments, it is beneficial because you're really learning the info (which is good because honestly I never understood Statistics that much better after hearing Professor Donoghue's lectures). Either way, it's a solid fair class, but requires more time than you'd probably like it to.

I found the material to be very interesting but Professor Pereira, plainly said, is a boring lecturer. Her notes on the board are incomprehensible and the information on the slides are grammatically awkward. Also, there is an attendance sheet for each class and you are required to participate once out of the two days we meet a week. The upside is that she is a very easy grader. It is not difficult to write an A paper but still, going to class is a pain..and mandatory.

Congratulations!! You were randomly placed into one of Professor Carr's Frontiers of Science discussion section.  Unlike many other Columbia students, you will not come out of Frontiers hating it or feeling like you have got nothing out of it.  Professor Carr is a great professor who truly cares about teaching her students.  Her discussions are fantastic and she will make sure you all the important points that the lecturers made.  She has office hours set up and she is always there and willing to help you.  She frequently stays after office hours helping students though I would recommend that you actually get to her office before her office hours end.  Although discussion is great, Professor Carr does a great job explaining the material during office hours.  Besides her obvious teaching strengths, she is an extremely nice professor who truly wants to help all her students (besides teaching, she has offered to give us advice on how to get a research position as undergraduates).  She does really interesting research and has other experiences that you should talk to her about during office hours (she actually was invited to the UN during one weekend when I was taking her class).  Overall, she is a great professor and I wish Frontiers of Science was a year long class because of her.

Peter Pouncey is...a mixed experience.
On the plus side, he knows his shit really, really well. He's a very smart guy with a lot of interesting things to say. Lots of historical tidbits (he's a Thucydides scholar), and we usually end up discussing broader themes in life instead of staying narrowly with the text. He's also very funny and nice.
But...he's not always super lucid. He tends to repeat himself several times and revolves around the same topics during discussions. It's not bad at the beginning of the semester because a lot of it's new, but it gets old at the end. He's also not always very attentive and connected to the students. Frankly, we weren't smart enough to entertain him with something new: this was his 50th year teaching the course, so he's basically seen everything and heard everything.
Workload:

So my class called her Dr. Ramsey, and I definitely do not agree with the review below. She told us a few days ago that she won't continue teaching CC next semester (Spring 2014) because she admittedly could not put in the same time and effort in that she wanted to, given her newborn child and other things on her plate (she's a recent PhD graduate from Teachers College). Completely understandable because our class LOVES her stories about her family. But, we were all noticeably sad to hear the news.
Dr. Ramsey is incredibly intelligent and so humorous, and it's possible that it was because of the students and not the teacher, but we never had dull or awkward discussions. Many of our discussions ended in either laughs or serious individual contemplation over the topic at hand. It is very evident that she is passionate about Fall semester CC texts and that passion translated to the discussions. She does this thing where when the discussion starts rolling and people start raising their hands, she writes down the names in order on the board (so that you can put your hand down) and erases them one by one as each person finishes their point. It's a good feeling when you have 10+ names on the board because everyone has something to say and everyone else wants to hear it. At some point, the discussion has to get cut off so she closes with a final comment and then we move onto a different topic. I genuinely enjoyed what she had to say and the way she directed discussions.

His lecturing style takes some time to get used too. He doesn't explain everything outright - which I liked, because it always bored me half to death to have a teacher waste time on something that was obvious - and therefore always finishes class early. (We've even been let out after only 35 minutes - it was a short lecture.) 
Other times, his style can be confusing because he doesn't always explain what he's doing on the board, and if you can't hear him all you'll see are formulas scrawled on the board. He has good legible handwriting, though. Reading the book chapter beforehand, or reviewing your notes/asking him a question after lecture will help.
I'd recommend him for students who are proficient to well-versed in math. If you constantly need a refresher before every lecture, then choose someone else, or get in the habit of reviewing lecture notes a little before class.
He doesn't do WebAssign, which is a great bonus. WebAssign sucks. Instead, he just assigns a bunch of textbook problems.
His midterms are the best part. If you're wishy washy about choosing a math professor, choose Zeitlin for his tests. No dumb True/False questions, no stupid multiple choice questions. He gives you just six problems, all short answer (three to four lines of math), and I've finished the whole thing in ten or twenty minutes before. Some problems are easy, but the latter problems do require a little bit of thought, so overall I'd say the tests are fair.

If there were ratings lower than poor, this professor deserves it. His writing on the board lacks clarity and organization. He often miswrites equations, variables, etc. He can never find anything on the board and always has to rewrite the equation just to derive the next step. He never seems to have a point to his lectures, as he mainly just derives the equations on the board.
The worst part is - I gave him this feedback about halfway through the semester, and he did not even bother changing even a little bit. Really shows how much he cares about students actually learning something.
Unfortunately, you are stuck taking his class as a chem/biochem major, so there is no way out of it.
The only reason I am doing well in that class is because Matt is the best TA I’ve ever had. He is extremely helpful and takes detailed notes. He is the exact opposite of the professor.

Chuck Hailey is not a good teacher. He struggles with teaching. Worse, however, is his struggle with interpersonal interaction. He is by far the rudest professor I have ever had, and he frequently discourages students. Taking a class with him was a highly unpleasant experience and in the future I would refrain from taking a class just to avoid having him as a professor. He was also a complete mess, organizationally, and a nightmare as a lecturer. Nobody ever knew what he was talking about except for two kids who had taken more advanced classes than everyone else and would always ask questions, and he would frequently get in some sort of childish rage and start to be really combative with them instead of just answering their questions, to which he often - even admittedly - didn't know the answers. I learned very little in the class, because I spent all my time pouring over poorly organized notes (for lack of a course textbook) to figure out what his pointlessly ambiguous problems were asking for. Chuck Hailey seems like the kind of person who has made a lot of people cry with his words over the years.

I have a background in East Asian Studies from another institute, so I thought I'd knock out a core requirement here and be done, but Professor Kim has made me want to take another for fun. Let me say I'm not a history person, but her enthusiasm for all of the discussed topics and willingness to go above and beyond for each student made this a class I looked forward to attending. She lectures to a powerpoint every class but expects students to interject where they see fit from our weekly readings and any outside knowledge. She loves discussion so be well read in this class -- my class only had 13 students so get ready for awkward silence should no one speak up for her questions. 
As for the workload, the readings are the most time consuming. She requires a weekly post with a student lead discussion during the last half of the second lecture day. There is also a midterm and final, but she gives you a handout a week prior (she might forget, so be sure to ask if she waits too long) covering everything on it. Both tests are very straightforward and she gives extra credit for knowing specific history details (e.g. slavery was abolished in 1894 instead of saying it ended at the end of the Choson dynasty). The other real requirement is a paper on whichever topic you choose. She meets with you to discuss it and is, again, very helpful. When I met with her, she gave me a list of sources and helped me create a complete outline detailing exactly what she wanted from my topic. 
I highly recommend this course if you're looking to fill a core requirement with a wonderful professor, even if you don't think ancient Korea is your forte.

I want to begin to say that I did not fail this class, nor did I do amazingly well. Now that the end of the semester is winding up, I will probably get at least a solid B in this class. Which isn't great for premed, but I honestly don't give a rat's ass anymore. Words cannot describe the amount of hatred I have towards this class. But let's start with the bright side:
The Good:
1. Stockwell himself is a nice guy. He actually cares about his students, and he does have office hours for those foolish enough to want to spend even more time with him. He also remembers everyone's names. EVERY SINGLE PERSON. IN A 200+ LECTURE. Which is impressive, but terrifying. He can also be humorous (if you appreciate awkward jokes). 
2. The class itself is really easy to do well in. Stockwell gives a lot of opportunities to accumulate points in the class that are not dependent on exams (haha. more on that later. just wait for this). 
3. Exams are pretty straightforward if you like to do bitch work and just memorize his goddamn slides.
4. The class itself if rather organized, and this class was had one of the most elaborate Courseworks pages I have ever seen. 
The Bad:
1. The homework. Either a 30 minute long video of just Stockwell sitting there, reading off a goddamn slideshow, and trying to make the course more interesting by including raps about the TCA cycle during the video (but he fails to send you links to the beautiful musical numbers for reference in the future), OR a goddamn paper. And not just any type of paper (oh no, not the short, sweet, 4 page papers that most professors assign), I'm talking about 60 page reviews. REVIEWS. WHAT. IS. MY. LIFE. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT GLUTATHIONE, WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME READ A REVIEW BY A GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE SHABBY FROM SCOOBY DOO. 
2. Daily quizzes. Every F***ING day. So basically, there are homework quizzes, worth 10% of your grade in total, that you take submit every day before class. The quizzes should be on the homework that was assigned, but oftentimes the questions don't really correspond with the material. The lowest 4 quizzes get dropped. 
3. Learning Catalytics. Basically, even though lecture is completely useless and a waste of my time and my life and the universe, they are mandatory. Sit and listen to Stockwell drone on for an hour, reading off of his projector (which are just his slideshows that he posts on Courseworks), adding no additional material to what you would learn from the slideshow. AND they are worth 15% of your grade.
4. Group Quizzes. This part isn't bad, but it's stupid and tedious. You basically get assigned a group and after every class you do like, 4 questions with your group members. This is quite an easy way to boost your grade (worth 15% of your grade) and you get to drop 4 group quizzes.
The UNBEARABLE:
1. As I mentioned, I will probably get a solid B in this class. BUT MY KNOWLEDGE OF BIOCHEMISTRY DOES NOT REFLECT THAT GRADE AT ALL. As in, I actually know SHIT about biochem, but I'm still able to get a pretty decent grade. This is the bullshit that is this class. 
2. The awkward, dumb pace of this class. Because Stockwell tries to pull in as many papers as possible for students to read, he doesn't actually spend enough time teaching the material we actually need to learn in biochemistry. We spent 1 day on Glycolysis, 1 day on TCA, and maybe 2 days on ETC. Most other biochemistry classes in the world spend like, a good third of the semester doing all of that shit. HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO READ ADVANCED PAPERS ON THESE SUBJECTS IF I WASN'T EVEN PROPERLY TAUGHT THE BASICS?
3. The UNBELIEVABLE amount of bullshit work that you need to do. Work that does not help you actually learn the material in the long haul. Ask me anything about biochemistry and I can't tell you shit, but somehow, I'm still spending 3-4 hours a week doing his bullshit work. 
4. Stockwell's face
5. Stockwell's voice
TL;DR: I would rather lick the inside of the toilet than take this class again. I would rather get hit by a car repeatedly than take this class again. I would rather take Mowsh's class 16 more times than take this class again. I would rather remove my arm, and use my detached limb to throw as a frisbee just for kicks and giggles than take this class again. Do not take this class if you don't like busy, bullshit work. It can be a grade booster since the exams are so straight forward, but honestly, you won't be learning shit. Not worth it. Take it at Barnard, or the other class that meets once a week. Biochemistry should be hard, but it shouldn't be a joke. Thank Baby Jesus that I am forever done with this piece of shit class.

Despite what past reviews have said about Dawn, there's another perspective that's worth considering. Which is that she is an incompetent teacher w.r.t. teaching concepts that students are not already familiar with. For students with a strong mathematical background, this is no problem, because, as previous reviews have mentioned, this class covers more breadth than depth. But because of the increase in CS majors, there's a corresponding increase in students in the class who haven't had as rigorous a math background. For us, Dawn's explanations leave a lot (everything) to be desired. She frequently backtracks, corrects herself, and equivocates when answering questions, e.g. (in response to a student's question) ""Well, you're right if we're on the same page,"" which is a non-answer, or ""If you're confused just try the practice problems on this at home,"" which defeats the purpose of going to class. 
The fact that the class seems to be split into students who have seen everything except graph theory before and students who have seen none of it means that, at least this semester, the latter were afraid to ask questions, which Dawn read as comfort with the material rather than confusion about the concepts (and/or the motivation for them). Disappointing, because I feel like the subject could be rewarding as taught by a teacher good at working with large audiences.
