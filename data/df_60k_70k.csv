I see that no one has reviewed Professor Hertz in a while and I think he deserves a good review. I am 99% sure I am a Biology major. In high school, I had very bad experiences with science teachers... So we can say that my preparation was not the best, although you are expected to have a solid background to succeed in the 1500 level course. My not-so-good preparation has been just enough. 
Professor Hertz is great. He KNOWS what he is talking about (he is one of the authors of the textbook). He makes his lectures easy to follow by providing us pre-made (by HIM) outlines and we only have to fill them in. He  tells you exactly what chapters (and sometimes even what certain pages in that chapter) you need to read to be prepared for that lecture and consequently, to be prepared for the exam. He does question periods like 2 weeks before the exams. He is very open to questions from students during this period but not during lecture because lectures are HUGE. ... So his lectures are great. They can become boring at the end of the semester because it is the same style of teaching all semester long. But whatever! Everything he says helps your understanding of the material. Besides, exams are mostly based on lectures and less based on the textbook. 
The most annoying part is the weekly online homeworks. They are so long and you actually need to read the textbook to answer the questions in the Aplia portal. I hate doing this, but it will certainly help your grade at the end if you do them NOT-carelessly. Besides this, you have the option of doing online quizzes posted on Courseworks for bonus points. He says it doesn't matter what your score is. You just do the *optional* quizzes and you get bonus points at the end. No one really knows how much these bonus points help you... Bust JUST DO IT. 
All in all, Professor Hertz is very smart!!! I'm not saying I will be a Bio major because of him. That would be a lie. But I will say that he does make the course a liiiiittle more easy going than it would otherwise be. Bio will always be tough... Especially the 1500 level, so don't expect to be completely prepared for what is to come in this intro course.

Avoid at all costs. He is arrogant, lazy, and not very smart. He'll give you dumbed down lectures , saying things about comic books that my grandma could come up with. Ignores anything interesting or even a little controversial (he had a really difficult time talking about race and gender in graphic novels, for example, even though we were reading great material like March and Fun Home--maybe because he doesn't think about these things?). I also got a pretty sexist vibe from him and he was very condescending in office hours. Maybe jocks have had other experiences. But especially in a class like the American graphic novel where you teach sensitive material about gender and sexuality, you should be aware that these things are issues! 
He's also a really bad communicator, never clarified assignments, pushed around deadlines and skipped lectures or replaced them with bullisht ""discussion sections."" Everyone was so confused in this class! Even the other professor and TAs who were really sweet, seemed fed up with this guy.

This class was amazing. The professor has a way of breaking down complicated concepts, which not only makes you feel smart for understanding but gives you confidence to attempt to understand others. Who knew I would be able to calculate orbital periods of planets after the end of this course? Certainly not I! Seriously though, the class gave me a good working basic knowledge about the Earth, Moon and Planets which comes in handy every day. Every time I watch a science fiction movie about the solar system, this comes to mind. Articles about satellites and the discovery of Earth like planets, which are always on the news are no longer intelligible. The professor is also very approachable in the class but also office hours. I recommend this class to all. You won't regret taking it. (I am not a science major, took this as part of my Core)

Heidi comes across as extremely nice during the first few weeks of class (aka shopping period), but then she becomes extremely passive agressive towards the class. Her exams are extremely difficult, both to prepare for and to take. The majority of class will be going over literature, but the bulk of the test will be grammar, barely discussed in class. Plus, this is the class where your accent will come to die. While Heidi definitely has a fantastic grasp of French grammar, her American prononciation of all words forces you and the rest of the class to care less.

This class is just time consuming. It isn't hard to get a decent grade in, per se, because the math isn't hard and because you have homework assignments that bring it up no matter what. I didn't study for the exam and got a C, but with the HWs I was able to pick up my grade to a A-. The class gives you a chance to think in a really interesting way in terms of statistics, Professor Donoghue really cares about how you do and what you're taking away from his class, and it's a fair class. Those are the positives. The homework is quite time consuming. Like others have said, even with the time-consuming hw assignments, it is beneficial because you're really learning the info (which is good because honestly I never understood Statistics that much better after hearing Professor Donoghue's lectures). Either way, it's a solid fair class, but requires more time than you'd probably like it to.

I found the material to be very interesting but Professor Pereira, plainly said, is a boring lecturer. Her notes on the board are incomprehensible and the information on the slides are grammatically awkward. Also, there is an attendance sheet for each class and you are required to participate once out of the two days we meet a week. The upside is that she is a very easy grader.

Congratulations!! You were randomly placed into one of Professor Carr's Frontiers of Science discussion section.  Unlike many other Columbia students, you will not come out of Frontiers hating it or feeling like you have got nothing out of it.  Professor Carr is a great professor who truly cares about teaching her students.  Her discussions are fantastic and she will make sure you all the important points that the lecturers made.  She has office hours set up and she is always there and willing to help you.  She frequently stays after office hours helping students though I would recommend that you actually get to her office before her office hours end.  Although discussion is great, Professor Carr does a great job explaining the material during office hours.  Besides her obvious teaching strengths, she is an extremely nice professor who truly wants to help all her students (besides teaching, she has offered to give us advice on how to get a research position as undergraduates).  She does really interesting research and has other experiences that you should talk to her about during office hours (she actually was invited to the UN during one weekend when I was taking her class).  Overall, she is a great professor and I wish Frontiers of Science was a year long class because of her.

Peter Pouncey is...a mixed experience.
On the plus side, he knows his shit really, really well. He's a very smart guy with a lot of interesting things to say. Lots of historical tidbits (he's a Thucydides scholar), and we usually end up discussing broader themes in life instead of staying narrowly with the text. He's also very funny and nice.
But...he's not always super lucid. He tends to repeat himself several times and revolves around the same topics during discussions. It's not bad at the beginning of the semester because a lot of it's new, but it gets old at the end. He's also not always very attentive and connected to the students. Frankly, we weren't smart enough to entertain him with something new: this was his 50th year teaching the course, so he's basically seen everything and heard everything.

So my class called her Dr. Ramsey, and I definitely do not agree with the review below. She told us a few days ago that she won't continue teaching CC next semester (Spring 2014) because she admittedly could not put in the same time and effort in that she wanted to, given her newborn child and other things on her plate (she's a recent PhD graduate from Teachers College). Completely understandable because our class LOVES her stories about her family. But, we were all noticeably sad to hear the news.
Dr. Ramsey is incredibly intelligent and so humorous, and it's possible that it was because of the students and not the teacher, but we never had dull or awkward discussions. Many of our discussions ended in either laughs or serious individual contemplation over the topic at hand. It is very evident that she is passionate about Fall semester CC texts and that passion translated to the discussions. She does this thing where when the discussion starts rolling and people start raising their hands, she writes down the names in order on the board (so that you can put your hand down) and erases them one by one as each person finishes their point. It's a good feeling when you have 10+ names on the board because everyone has something to say and everyone else wants to hear it. At some point, the discussion has to get cut off so she closes with a final comment and then we move onto a different topic. I genuinely enjoyed what she had to say and the way she directed discussions.

His lecturing style takes some time to get used too. He doesn't explain everything outright - which I liked, because it always bored me half to death to have a teacher waste time on something that was obvious - and therefore always finishes class early. (We've even been let out after only 35 minutes - it was a short lecture.) 
Other times, his style can be confusing because he doesn't always explain what he's doing on the board, and if you can't hear him all you'll see are formulas scrawled on the board. He has good legible handwriting, though. Reading the book chapter beforehand, or reviewing your notes/asking him a question after lecture will help.
I'd recommend him for students who are proficient to well-versed in math. If you constantly need a refresher before every lecture, then choose someone else, or get in the habit of reviewing lecture notes a little before class.
He doesn't do WebAssign, which is a great bonus. WebAssign sucks. Instead, he just assigns a bunch of textbook problems.
His midterms are the best part. If you're wishy washy about choosing a math professor, choose Zeitlin for his tests. No dumb True/False questions, no stupid multiple choice questions. He gives you just six problems, all short answer (three to four lines of math), and I've finished the whole thing in ten or twenty minutes before. Some problems are easy, but the latter problems do require a little bit of thought, so overall I'd say the tests are fair.

If there were ratings lower than poor, this professor deserves it. His writing on the board lacks clarity and organization. He often miswrites equations, variables, etc. He can never find anything on the board and always has to rewrite the equation just to derive the next step. He never seems to have a point to his lectures, as he mainly just derives the equations on the board.
The worst part is - I gave him this feedback about halfway through the semester, and he did not even bother changing even a little bit. Really shows how much he cares about students actually learning something.
Unfortunately, you are stuck taking his class as a chem/biochem major, so there is no way out of it.
The only reason I am doing well in that class is because Matt is the best TA I’ve ever had. He is extremely helpful and takes detailed notes. He is the exact opposite of the professor.

Chuck Hailey is not a good teacher. He struggles with teaching. Worse, however, is his struggle with interpersonal interaction. He is by far the rudest professor I have ever had, and he frequently discourages students. Taking a class with him was a highly unpleasant experience and in the future I would refrain from taking a class just to avoid having him as a professor. He was also a complete mess, organizationally, and a nightmare as a lecturer. Nobody ever knew what he was talking about except for two kids who had taken more advanced classes than everyone else and would always ask questions, and he would frequently get in some sort of childish rage and start to be really combative with them instead of just answering their questions, to which he often - even admittedly - didn't know the answers. I learned very little in the class, because I spent all my time pouring over poorly organized notes (for lack of a course textbook) to figure out what his pointlessly ambiguous problems were asking for. Chuck Hailey seems like the kind of person who has made a lot of people cry with his words over the years.

I have a background in East Asian Studies from another institute, so I thought I'd knock out a core requirement here and be done, but Professor Kim has made me want to take another for fun. Let me say I'm not a history person, but her enthusiasm for all of the discussed topics and willingness to go above and beyond for each student made this a class I looked forward to attending. She lectures to a powerpoint every class but expects students to interject where they see fit from our weekly readings and any outside knowledge. She loves discussion so be well read in this class -- my class only had 13 students so get ready for awkward silence should no one speak up for her questions. 
As for the workload, the readings are the most time consuming. She requires a weekly post with a student lead discussion during the last half of the second lecture day. There is also a midterm and final, but she gives you a handout a week prior (she might forget, so be sure to ask if she waits too long) covering everything on it. Both tests are very straightforward and she gives extra credit for knowing specific history details (e.g. slavery was abolished in 1894 instead of saying it ended at the end of the Choson dynasty). The other real requirement is a paper on whichever topic you choose. She meets with you to discuss it and is, again, very helpful. When I met with her, she gave me a list of sources and helped me create a complete outline detailing exactly what she wanted from my topic. 
I highly recommend this course if you're looking to fill a core requirement with a wonderful professor, even if you don't think ancient Korea is your forte.

I want to begin to say that I did not fail this class, nor did I do amazingly well. Now that the end of the semester is winding up, I will probably get at least a solid B in this class. Which isn't great for premed, but I honestly don't give a rat's ass anymore. Words cannot describe the amount of hatred I have towards this class. But let's start with the bright side:
The Good:
1. Stockwell himself is a nice guy. He actually cares about his students, and he does have office hours for those foolish enough to want to spend even more time with him. He also remembers everyone's names. EVERY SINGLE PERSON. IN A 200+ LECTURE. Which is impressive, but terrifying. He can also be humorous (if you appreciate awkward jokes). 
2. The class itself is really easy to do well in. Stockwell gives a lot of opportunities to accumulate points in the class that are not dependent on exams (haha. more on that later. just wait for this). 
3. Exams are pretty straightforward if you like to do bitch work and just memorize his goddamn slides.
4. The class itself if rather organized, and this class was had one of the most elaborate Courseworks pages I have ever seen. 
The Bad:
1. The homework. Either a 30 minute long video of just Stockwell sitting there, reading off a goddamn slideshow, and trying to make the course more interesting by including raps about the TCA cycle during the video (but he fails to send you links to the beautiful musical numbers for reference in the future), OR a goddamn paper. And not just any type of paper (oh no, not the short, sweet, 4 page papers that most professors assign), I'm talking about 60 page reviews. REVIEWS. WHAT. IS. MY. LIFE. I DON'T GIVE A SHIT ABOUT GLUTATHIONE, WHY ARE YOU MAKING ME READ A REVIEW BY A GUY WHO LOOKS LIKE SHABBY FROM SCOOBY DOO. 
2. Daily quizzes. Every F***ING day. So basically, there are homework quizzes, worth 10% of your grade in total, that you take submit every day before class. The quizzes should be on the homework that was assigned, but oftentimes the questions don't really correspond with the material. The lowest 4 quizzes get dropped. 
3. Learning Catalytics. Basically, even though lecture is completely useless and a waste of my time and my life and the universe, they are mandatory. Sit and listen to Stockwell drone on for an hour, reading off of his projector (which are just his slideshows that he posts on Courseworks), adding no additional material to what you would learn from the slideshow. AND they are worth 15% of your grade.
4. Group Quizzes. This part isn't bad, but it's stupid and tedious. You basically get assigned a group and after every class you do like, 4 questions with your group members. This is quite an easy way to boost your grade (worth 15% of your grade) and you get to drop 4 group quizzes.
The UNBEARABLE:
1. As I mentioned, I will probably get a solid B in this class. BUT MY KNOWLEDGE OF BIOCHEMISTRY DOES NOT REFLECT THAT GRADE AT ALL. As in, I actually know SHIT about biochem, but I'm still able to get a pretty decent grade. This is the bullshit that is this class. 
2. The awkward, dumb pace of this class. Because Stockwell tries to pull in as many papers as possible for students to read, he doesn't actually spend enough time teaching the material we actually need to learn in biochemistry. We spent 1 day on Glycolysis, 1 day on TCA, and maybe 2 days on ETC. Most other biochemistry classes in the world spend like, a good third of the semester doing all of that shit. HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO READ ADVANCED PAPERS ON THESE SUBJECTS IF I WASN'T EVEN PROPERLY TAUGHT THE BASICS?
3. The UNBELIEVABLE amount of bullshit work that you need to do. Work that does not help you actually learn the material in the long haul. Ask me anything about biochemistry and I can't tell you shit, but somehow, I'm still spending 3-4 hours a week doing his bullshit work. 
4. Stockwell's face
5. Stockwell's voice
TL;DR: I would rather lick the inside of the toilet than take this class again. I would rather get hit by a car repeatedly than take this class again. I would rather take Mowsh's class 16 more times than take this class again. I would rather remove my arm, and use my detached limb to throw as a frisbee just for kicks and giggles than take this class again. Do not take this class if you don't like busy, bullshit work. It can be a grade booster since the exams are so straight forward, but honestly, you won't be learning shit. Not worth it. Take it at Barnard, or the other class that meets once a week. Biochemistry should be hard, but it shouldn't be a joke. Thank Baby Jesus that I am forever done with this piece of shit class.

Despite what past reviews have said about Dawn, there's another perspective that's worth considering. Which is that she is an incompetent teacher w.r.t. teaching concepts that students are not already familiar with. For students with a strong mathematical background, this is no problem, because, as previous reviews have mentioned, this class covers more breadth than depth. But because of the increase in CS majors, there's a corresponding increase in students in the class who haven't had as rigorous a math background. For us, Dawn's explanations leave a lot (everything) to be desired. She frequently backtracks, corrects herself, and equivocates when answering questions, e.g. (in response to a student's question) ""Well, you're right if we're on the same page,"" which is a non-answer, or ""If you're confused just try the practice problems on this at home,"" which defeats the purpose of going to class. 
The fact that the class seems to be split into students who have seen everything except graph theory before and students who have seen none of it means that, at least this semester, the latter were afraid to ask questions, which Dawn read as comfort with the material rather than confusion about the concepts (and/or the motivation for them). Disappointing, because I feel like the subject could be rewarding as taught by a teacher good at working with large audiences.

This course was one of the worst courses I've taken at Columbia thus far. That being said, it is mandatory for several engineering tracks, so you might just have to muddle through. If possible, take it with a different professor. Professor Feng made the course much more complicated than it needed to be. 
Professor Feng would consistently mislabel variables and make other problematic errors during lecture. When students would point out these mistakes, she would often stare at the board for several minutes in utter confusion.  Sometimes, she would just glaze over the mistake and quickly move on to the next example. Professor Feng also spends very little time explaining the fundamental material and instead spends a majority of each class going through examples. The lecture quality was so poor that attendance dropped sharply after the first few weeks of class.

Workload:
There are 12 problem sets, none of which can be dropped. They are not consistently due on the same day of the week every week, which can be difficult to keep track of.  Twice during the semester, two problem sets were due within a week of each other (once was during the final week of classes).

Professor Ivanyi is one of the nicest professors out there. She is genuinely enthusiastic about this subject and sports a smile throughout every lecture. Overall, her lectures are organized and broken down into the simplest possible terms, which I found to be especially helpful since I had very little prior knowledge of the subject. She will always write down important vocabulary terms on the chalkboard and explain their meaning and significance. If you take no other notes in this class, at the very least be sure to write down the definition of these terms (they will make up a majority of the vocabulary that appears on the quizzes). The reading is, more often than not, helpful but not always necessary. However, it is very diverse and usually quite interesting, so I wouldn’t rule it out altogether.

Professor Rouhe (or simply Todd, as his students call him) is hilariously sassy and overwhelming amicable. He effectively taught the basics of model-making and hand drafting, emphasizing a clean and careful technique. In terms of project content, he provides explicit guidelines but is intentionally vague in describing what the final product should be. In this way, he allows the student to wield tremendous artistic license (which is particularly refreshing for SEAS students like myself). He provides helpful and constructive criticism during desk crits and pinups, but is careful to let the student work through his/her own ideas. With the exception of final pinups for a particular project, reviews were meant to help students at any stage in their creative process. The overall emphasis seemed to be on a step-by-step progression of ideas.

Honestly, I don't think anyone knows exactly how your grade is calculated in this class, but from what I understand, Todd wants to see a concentrated effort on the part of the student.

Listen, if you're trying to see a man with the flyest black crew neck baggy sweatshirt around then let me tell you this is the class for you. It's difficult to pull off the shirt unbuttoned down past the nipples look but somehow Dr. Longman pulls it off. It's almost unheard of to be able to nail the my shirt is definitely on backwards but I'm running with it anyway, but time and again Richard proves doubters, haters, and peasants in the land of academia wrong. 
If, however, you're basing your class choice decision upon reasons other than a professor's fashion sense (not sure why you would do this) then this might not be the class for you............. UNLESS.......
You're someone who: 
a.) Loves cruise control, all things cruise control, and automobiles that have cruise control
b.) Has an undying love of satellites doing their satellite things
c.) Really has a fond appreciation of the equation 1/((s+1)(s+2))
d.) Enjoys not being able to hear the professor's lecture over the sound of an ant sneezing in Piscataway, New Jersey
e.) Really has an unnatural affinity for cruise control (this can't be stressed enough)
f.) Did I mention cruise control

A lot of the material covered in this course was covered in signals & systems and the material is pretty straightforward. Overall, EE's don't mind the class but Mech E's assimilate the course to something akin to those floaty things that move around the corner of your eye sometimes. 
In conclusion, 
Dr. Longman has more swag than a modern day DaVinci (see first paragraph), but sit up front if you want to hear him. He tells some boring stories and covers the same thing every day pretty much but there really aren't any curveballs in the class. Seriously, if you're into cruise control then you'll enjoy this class more than finding that phone charger that's eluded you for the past month.

I had to write a review for Sean because he really is a top-notch TA. 
Sean taught one of the three required discussion sections for the History of the World to 1450 course. I know what the term ""discussion section"" usually brings to mind: a small group of students, glancing at the clock every five minutes, each one thinking of that one golden piece of BS that they plan to say so that they will have spoken at least once that day. But not Sean's discussion section. Sean has an incredible knack for stimulating student discussion without making it feel forced. He is a genuinely nice guy who creates a comfortable environment for his students. Discussion flows so smoothly and so naturally that the hour-long section seems to pass in much less time. Discussion usually focused on the material covered that past week in lecture, and Sean would pay special attention to particularly confusing or complex topics. His clarification was an enormous help in understanding the otherwise overwhelming concepts of world history.
Outside of lecture, Sean was available nearly every hour of the day. He would typically respond to emails within several hours which was especially helpful when working on one of the two papers for this course.
On a final note, Sean connected to his students on a personal level. Before each discussion section started, he would ask everyone how they're doing and how their other classes are treating them. Sean's honest personality combined with his effective teaching style make him truly one of Columbia's best TAs.

Dr Rao is obviously very accomplished and knows her material down pat. I took her freshman seminar CSI to Pumpkin Pie which met once a week for an hour, and it was an absolute waste of my time, which is really disappointing seeing as how I had to write an essay to get into the class.
I do not take any chemistry courses, and this class is catered more towards people with a deeper understanding of chemistry than just snippets from high school. I thought this class was going to be interesting because it would explain the everyday aspects of chemistry, such as in art restoration or poisons. The class mostly comprised of her reading aloud snippets from books, playing videos, or writing complicated chemical structures on the blackboard. I have learned absolutely nothing from that class.
Dr Rao is also extremely flighty and seems constantly discombobulated. 
On the plus side, this class has no final or midterm, and only two papers (4 pages) throughout the entire semester, on anything you want. It's also P/F.

Susan is one of the very few human beings in this world in whom I cannot find fault. She's absolutely amazing at what she does, and despite the fact that she would frequently stress that she was more accustomed to teaching in a lecture style, her ways of running discussion in CC were fantastic. She can effortlessly stimulate conversation for the entire two hours, and after two drab lithum teachers last year, Susan was a welcome change (also, keep in mind that these discussions were always somewhere between mildly inspiring and ground-breaking).
And her fabulous teaching methods aside, she is a wonderful person to be around. She fully understands the stress that this school puts on us, and because of this, she sets up the curriculum in the most painless way possible. Two papers balanced so that their due dates were not during midterms, NO MIDTERM in the class, and very easy pop quizzes (easy as long as you read, that is) made it so that I hardly had to stress about the course as long as I kept up with the readings.
Overall, I'd call it a privilege to have Susan as a CC instructor, and if you're lucky enough to get her, consider yourself blessed.

I could see how some people don't like Professor Kasara.  But at the same time haters gon hate.
This class could be amazing for certain kinds of people and terrible for others.  It really depends on how you learn.  As someone who has a very hard time learning from textbooks, and rather pays extremely close attention to lectures and slides, I have enjoyed this class.  Having read practically nothing I feel like I've learned so much more than in any other polisci class at Columbia and am expecting an A- overall.  She's a decent lecturer and has really comprehensive slides that she posts on courseworks that really tell 90% of what you need to know. 
That being said this class is not for some types of learners.  There are the people in class that read everything and either don't come to lecture or don't pay attention once they get there.  If this is you YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  With professor Kasara these are the people that never seem to know what's going on and get bad grades on the exams (and I suspect the people below who thought the course was confusing).
In terms of personality, Professor Kasara can be subtly hilarious in lecture (if you pay attention), but I can also see why some people could think she's a jerk.  Like she'll make jokes throughout lecture, but also swear heavily at you if you don't put your pen down at time in an exam.  If you raise your hand once or twice she'll learn your name and affably tolerate your puny existence. Just don't piss her off personally and you'll be fine.

As a non-science major who put in effort for the course, I found it more difficult than I had expected it to be.
Prof. Honisch is a nice lady who is quick and willing to entertain questions, as are her TAs. Unfortunately, with little backgrounding in science and oceanography, I found the lectures often hard to follow (8:40am start time does not help). Some of the powerpoint slides, which are essential to the course, were a bit disorganised and questions on the homework and exams were often confusing.
If a non-science major made it to office hours often, he/she could probably scrape a decent grade in this class. But it is far from an easy A if you don't have background.

The class was basically a walkthrough of AWS. By the end you will have seen a bunch of different AWS services and this is kind of interesting but it should be approached as a teach-yourself-as-you-go type of class.
Professor Sahu is an ineffective lecturer. He does provide a list of interesting papers to read, and recommends several other readings which are good, but I took away almost nothing from his lectures. I would recommend never showing up on time because nothing ever happens in the first 20 or so minutes. Additionally he missed several lectures, and had other guest lectures where clearly he had dropped it on the person at the last minute. I got the impression he had a lot of other things going on and this class was not his priority.

You'll spend half of the class learning Java, which is pretty easy if you put time into it. The other half is more theoretical, though it shouldn't be a big problem if you're competent in math.
The workload is manageable. Again, the amount of time you'll spend outside of class studying and working on the problem sets really depends on 1) your aptitude in math, which many CC/GS kids - I'm sorry to say - lack, but more importantly, 2) how much you enjoy CS and learning about algorithmic thinking and problem solving. If you fit into both categories, you'll breeze through this class; if you're merely good at math but spend no time studying, you can expect to get a B-/B, and if you're not so good at math but really enjoy the subject or spend a shit ton of time studying, you can probably walk out with at least an A-.

I was in the same situation as the review below - after scouring CULPA and finding horrible, horrible reviews on Prof. Springs, I tried my hardest to get out of the class, and didn't succeed. Now that it's the end of the semester, I can safely say that this was one of my favorite classes this semester. Prof. Springs is very knowledgeable and so very willing to help out students any way she can. The only time I saw that she used her iPad during class was when she was taking attendance from it. Although I may be mistaken, I do not believe she was ever disengaged because of it. She always responded promptly to my emails, and was always available during office hours. In my opinion, she was a pretty great professor!

I was really excited going into this class—I'm a huge fan of graphic novels and think it's important that they be viewed as serious literature. This class left such a bad taste in my mouth, though. This class is not an engaging look at the history of graphic novels or a study of the development of the medium. You are literally just given a list of graphic novels on the syllabus to read and the lectures are a string of random anecdotes about them. There is a lot of breadth, but absolutely no depth. All of the assignments are vague and have nothing to do with the lectures, and are just given for the sake of having assignments. They try to run the lecture like a seminar, and what happens is that the same five people talk the whole class and the other students are given nothing to work with. There is also literally a ""race week"" and a ""gender week"" and the way the professors approached these subjects is stale and antiquated. 
What made the entire experience worse, though, was that the professors were not open at all to criticism. They wanted our feedback the last day, but spent the whole time justifying their decisions instead of considering the fact that their refusing to plan their lectures or write assignments comes off as lazy and disrespectful of our time. They also told us they didn't want to approach the texts from critical perspectives since they wanted to ""present a buffet"" of works for us to read instead. This class is a survey in the most basic sense, and you could get more out of reading the books on your own then sitting through the painful, shallow lectures. It was also infuriating how strictly the papers were graded when we were given so little to work with. 
This class was not only disrespectful to the students investing time in it, but disrespectful to the medium itself. It's been fighting for years to be accepted as a legitimate literature in the academy, and this class hurts the progress it has made in the past decades.

Alice is not for the faint of heart. As an adviser, she is a lovely combination of sassy and nurturing, and eager to discuss her craft with you. Students who make an effort to ask questions about their directing projects, put in thoughtful effort, and meet with her one-on-one also get to see this side of her. In class, however, she does not suffer fools, and doesn't hold back criticism for late papers and underprepared scene presentations. You will want to work, whether you like directing or not, because if you don't put in a solid effort for each of her assignments, she'll call you out in front of the class - especially early in the semester. If you're particularly sensitive to criticism, this can seem sadistic, but it is her way of creating a classroom climate where nobody wastes anyone else's time, and you come to appreciate that. 
She is good at teaching how to make pretty and effective stage pictures through composition techniques. She uses her own Viewpoints training frequently as a director, which is interesting for actors trained in the discipline. She does her best to teach ""how to interact with actors,"" but takes a kind of trial-by-fire approach - ""you just have to figure out what language each actor speaks and use it in rehearsal"" - that does little to decrease the stress of rehearsing your grade-defining final project. 
Your experience of this course's workload will depend on what play Alice picks for the final scenes. This semester, it was Clybourne Park. Everyone had to do a scene from it, whether they liked the play or not. 
I'd recommend taking a class with Alice - she's got a lot to teach about life and power and art as a tool for representation - but steel yourself for criticism and bring your best to every class.

Two presentations of the same scene, graded by how well you take and integrate criticism into your final scene. A 15-25 page directing portfolio explaining the play from which your scene is drawn, but some of those pages can be visual research, so don't stress about how much writing it will be.

How do I love Jeremy? Let me count the ways: he only assigns the most necessary chapters. Though he lets discussion go where it will and keeps the class pretty flexible, his lectures are well prepared and he makes sure he knows his stuff (though he made it clear on the first day that he was NOT a professor and NOT in expert in anything except Nietzsche maybe sort of). He prefaces each philosopher with a funny story. He's fine with fast-and-loose weekly responses even if they're ranty. He brought us jellybeans once. He sends long in-depth emails. On papers he gives LOTS of feedback and makes sure to comment on the things we did well. He is a fair grader. He has a sense of humor. He makes sure everyone gets to talk, and the class feels like a very safe space to have opinions. He devoted an entire class to Ferguson and came equipped with a hefty pile of police violence and mass-incarceration statistics to refocus the discussion when it strayed. He showed us Philosopher Football in class. Knowing that he is always stressed out about his dissertation and is basically a malnourished grad student with chronic migraines made it all the more impressive that he brought as much attention and care to this class as he did. He's the nicest guy and I feel like I learned a lot this semester.
Workload:
Weekly email responses. Very relaxed. Allows extensions on papers, in fact often extended deadlines regardless. Take-home midterm (which I think was not what he usually does), in-class final.

CONS:
Professor Gaifman may be a brilliant man, but he does not belong at the front of a classroom. I'm still not sure what his intentions were with this course, despite coming in with an open mind and excitement to learn more philosophy. He can also be remarkably cruel, and all but oblivious to student concerns and input. He made probability-which should be tremendously useful and insightful-a depressing subject to learn this semester.
Assignments were extremely vague and unclear due to Gaifman's unique and somewhat esoteric notation. Even when much of the class was unable to interpret certain questions, he only provided stubborn retorts such as ""THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR"" and entirely refused to compromise on what we all believed to be reasonable concerns. His grading method was a mystery, with many points deducted from assignments but zero markings or feedback given. Because the assignments were so obscure, most of the answers given by myself and others were only discovered via Google.
Why is this required for the Econ-Phil major? With statistics and symbolic logic already on the major requirements, this class is not very useful. I would have much rather preferred a course in the history or philosophical foundations of economics. Reading Smith, Marx, Mill, etc. would have been immensely more beneficial than listening to Gaifman's incomprehensible ramblings about abstract probability axioms. Oh well, I suppose I should be used to Columbia wasting my time and money by now.
Also, the fact that he showed up late to EVERY lecture, and proceeded to scold other students for being late was particularly enraging.

Dani (as she likes to be called) makes this class a lot more enjoyable and a lot less painful than it could be given the workload (see below...). She really wants you to succeed, though the quizzes at times may make you feel otherwise. Overall, I was expecting to hate this class given all the hype and it ended up being one of my best experiences at Columbia. Granted, as a postbac I had more time to attend OHs, work on lab reports, etc. I can see how as an undergrad with 5+ classes it could be a nightmare. The bottom line is, this class is much more work than you would expect from a 3 credit course, but you also get a lot more out of it than say, bio lab. If you prepare your schedule accordingly, you will be fine. Also, I cannot stress this enough, go to OH! It will save you a lot of time sitting at home spinning your wheels and probably ending up with the wrong answer.

The course has changed drastically since the last review as Prof Stockwell has implemented a ""flipped classroom."" Although this means more day to day work (hwk quizzes, in-class questions, team problems), I feel that it has drastically improved the course. I thought biochem was going to be an agonizingly detailed look at mechanisms, but was pleasantly surprised when the material was relatively conceptual and brain-teaserish at times. The only downside is that there is no curve, but the drop policy is fairly generous so an A range grade is very doable.

Professor Salanie creates questions for problem sets and exams that can not be solved through the use of the textbook that has been assigned. This would not be so great of a problem if he was able to clearly articulate the material during lectures, but instead he uses circular reasoning to come to questionable solutions (if he ever does reach a conclusion). He is very difficult to follow and does not appear to come in to class with any specific plan of what he wishes to express, which would explain why he often goes off on tangents and rarely defines even the most basic of concepts. Although Principles is apparently supposed to teach us the basics of economic theory, the class taught by Salanie is entirely based off of math and its applications, which is very difficult for those of us who have no background in economics which would allow us to understand the underlying concepts. Essentially, the only people who do not seem to be having extreme difficulty with the course are those who have already taken both macroeconomics and microeconomics courses already.

I suppose when it comes to how much you enjoy Prof Yogesh's class, it's really about learning style. He tends to lecture a lot, but my class did have good discussions almost every class. Sometimes, if not many people have done the reading, it can get awkwardly silent, but most days it's fine. He does ask really difficult questions which can stump the class, but he'd then follow up with more manageable questions for us to guide the discussion the point he's trying to make. He's a very intellectual and knowledgeable professor.
Personally I had a great time. His background in anthropology means that he really focuses on the social context and impact of the texts, which really helped in my understanding of the concepts raised in the books. A lot of theories can be easily misread when taken out of their social contexts after all. After discussing the background he would then walk you through the logic of the authors - it can be easy to get lost in this part of the class since he makes logical jumps sometimes, but not understanding his exact logic won't cost you much in the assessments. If the older reviews are true, then I'd say that he has definitely improved as an instructor of the course. He did not give off a sense of being condescending to anyone. Sometimes he'd play the devil's advocate, but it's really all to get us onto the right track of thinking about the content.
Grading wise, it would be difficult to get an A in this class, though a solid A- is pretty achievable if you have taken good notes in class during his lectures. I had a pretty bad experience with a LitHum instructor that often graded us based on how much our interpretation of the texts aligned with his own interpretations, and I'm really glad Prof Yogesh doesn't do that despite his slightly intimidating class style. He would accept your interpretation as the logic was sound and you could follow through with it in your paper. His paper topics are also pretty straightforward and draws on content that he has given lectures on. His assessments are manageable and humane.
Overall - pretty great professor if you prefer a more lecture-y style class with a focus on history/social impact!

I feel as if I matured three years in the span of the semester. Professor Mercer is a glorious, spastic and intelligent woman. A wonderful class for every gender identity, race and age.

Just want to start off saying that Van is a great professor. He is extremely knowledgeable and intelligent, and yet so relatable! He covers the topics so thoroughly and chose readings that were genuinely interesting. Although, they were tedious, ranged from 2 chapters to half an entire book weekly, I was able to read them all (or at least skim through some). He will tell you his thoughts and opinions straight and honestly, which to some may seem a little abrasive but in actuality he is just a nice guy. I thoroughly enjoyed this seminar. That said the discussions were at times dry and repetitive, going over the general themes of the readings took up majority of the class time.

I'd like to give y'all and update as I read the ""dear brilliant slacker"" post and think that another perspective could be useful.
while it is definitely helpful to study week by week, it is not necessary. if you are willing to study for 3 days straight then you can get to the midterm and do perfectly. if you are willing to study for 3-4 days straight then you can do that for the final and know everything too. 
Yes it is a TON of information to memorize, and some of it i think is not useful for us to learn, however you can memorize it all if you try. Also, you don't need to memorize absolutely everything because she gives you options on the tests and asks for 3-5 traits, so you don't need to know them ALL as she tells you in class.
Going in to the class I thought this would be a fascinating class on the story of human evolution, and would incorporate theories on why things happened (like bipedalism etc). However, sadly, this did not happen at all. Theories don't mater to Shapiro, only what you see in the fossils. 
When the previous reviewers said ""memorize a lot of bones"" , I'd like to clarify that it is BONES AND ONLY BONES. Nothing else is important to Shapiro. Only bones/ skeletal morphology , and how the traits of the bones relate to taxonomy. In that regard, it is boring material - you learn bones and know that they relate to other species. 
Also something I would have liked to know before taking the class: the first half of the class is all about evolutionary principles and morphological trends for primates and humans etc, and the second half is about the actual evolution of humans. However, this is thoroughly detailed, as we start with the evolution of primates and work out way up the phylogenic tree to hominins. just letting you know... there's a LOT. 65 millions years worth. I personally thought that primate evolution was excessive...
Overall, Shapiro herself is an incredibly dedicated professor, and it committed to having every student pass the class. She is incredibly particular and specific about what she wants you to know (throughout lecture she'll point out what you need to know and what you don't need to know for the test. she writes most notes on the board. anything on the board is fair game). this is helpful, though annoying to be always reminded about the tests every day in lecture. 
She also doesn't like taking questions in lecture, but makes you ask them after lecture is over. I found this good because she uses every single minute of lecture to cram information in, and she can't get sidetracked. However i know that some students would rather ask questions in class. She is very welcoming of any questions in office hours and via email, and is extremely punctual at answering email!
know that she is very very very specific about what she wants - it shows in her emails, her exam instructions, and lecture, all the way down to what writing utensil to use on the exams, and whether or not you come to lecture (yes she takes attendance). I found this helpful but a bit overdone.

I'd say he's mediocre. 
his lectures aren't very organized, he kind of rambles and focuses in on things too much. he's a fair grader, and is pleasant. but i think that his personal life gets in the way of his teaching sometimes - he will bring up marriage and divorce a lot in class...

Paula taught music humanities for the first time this fall and was absolutely incredible. She understands that the core forces us to do things with breadth over depth but to make everything more interesting she only goes through one or two pieces of music each class to allow for enough depth to have fun with each topic. Her enthusiasm was what made the class the easiest to deal with, and when she wasn't particularly enthusiastic about a specific topic she made sure to bring in one of her musically inclined friends that was (she couldn't play the piano for our Romatic Piano class, so she brought in a friend who was obsessed with and could play Debussy beautifully, for example). It was also great that she was able to combine her enthusiasm for the music with some critical discussion about why we study the Western Canon and old white men in general, which I don't think can be ignored when you're teaching a class like this. 
Workload:
Four papers, two fun ones that were ""name a piece of music you like/name a piece of music you don't like and use musical terminology to describe why,"" one based on a concert and one short reflection.

I went into this class with mixed feelings and expectations, because I had poor English teachers in high school. Professor Breyer met these mixed expectations.
The books for his class were moderately interesting, but there truly was a lot of reading, and a lot of writing. We had two five page essays and one ten page research paper, along with weekly short papers on the books we were reading. As long as you raised your hand to speak once in a blue moon you wouldn't get called out to speak against your will for participation points.
Professor Breyer himself I am ambivalent about. Did I emerge from his class a better writer? Yes. The writing fellows especially helped. Professor Breyer was more than willing to meet with someone one-on-one and give feedback. However, he also seemed incredibly awkward around people, and constantly talked very quietly - even when we asked him to speak up. He also never made eye contact with anyone. 
Overall not a bad course (complete with field trips out of your own free time) but I wouldn't go out of my way to take this class.

i don't get why there aren't more reviews here!
west is a brilliant professor. she is no-nonsense, which i really appreciate. she has a great sense of humor and is always spunky, and knows the right time to be professional and the right time to be herself. i really liked seeing a mix of that in the classroom, as i felt that she was both a great person and a great professor and researcher. she has so much knowledge, and is great at explaining things.
she also is chill about deadlines - if you need an extension, she will give it to you. she understands that her students have lives and in that regard she really seems like she cares.
she hates email, so its best if you go talk to her in person after class or in office hours or even by phone, she says. 
overall, she made class enjoyable and fun because she is witty and frank and loves intellectual critiques.

This is by far the best global course class I have ever taken at Columbia (tbh though that's not saying much). Berninghausen is a good teacher, though a little green behind the ears (this is her first ever class), and is spunky, charismatic and passionate about both Art History and Indian Art. She made class lively and interesting enough that I never wanted to skip, and actually seemed to care about her students. She was always willing to meet up and talk about any concerns or questions you had about the class, material, or just life in general.
I want to make this a fair review, so it must be noted that there are a few people who would disagree with me. The class was an interesting mix of Art History majors and others (about 50/50), and a couple of the non majors felt that Berninghausen favored the majors. This is a tricky suggestion to unpick, partly because of Berninghausen's level of investment in the class (which was very high) and her personality type / teaching style, which is quite personal (we learned a lot about her trips to India, her Hindu husband, her wedding, her childhood, etc.). So while I'd say that it's true that Berninghausen is not a purely objective, calculating person, and it's probably true that she did favor some of the students, I don't think the divide was between the Art History majors and the non-Art History majors, but between those who showed interest/enthusiasm and those who did not. For instance, she definitely graded you higher if you went in to talk to her about your paper before writing it. I think it's just that there's a correlation between people interested in this [Art History] class, and people majoring in Art History.
I'm not trying to defend her: it's totally unfair that she was biased in this way, and you shouldn't be expected to act enthusiastic about something if you are not (and it should certainly not impact your grade). It's just something to be aware of. I think it can be an enjoyable class for all majors (it really wasn't heavy on the Art History). I hadn't taken a non-Western art class before this but really enjoyed it. The material we looked at and discussed is fascinating and I feel like I now have a basic understanding of the art, history, geography, religion and politics of a country I knew absolutely nothing about before. 

Workload:
There was a decent amount of reading (particularly at the beginning of the semester), but Berninghausen was aware this was a problem. I read a few, skimmed most, and skipped some entirely and was absolutely fine.

She's awesome! Really fun to be in class with, she makes jokes that are actually funny! Her classes are pretty casual with a lot of conversation and not too much lecture. She's very understanding and lenient with deadlines and loves creativity even if you bend the guidelines of projects. Overall, a good class to finish up your language requirement with.

Professor Rojas is the superhero of organic chemistry. I took the full two-semester orgo sequence with him, and think he is by far the best science professor I have had at Columbia/ Barnard. He has consistently been an outstanding instructor and all-around great guy. He also manages to be inspiring, engaging, patient when explaining concepts or answering questions, enthusiastic, funny, interested in liberal education and subjects as diverse as poetry and the ukulele, and clearly communicates this technical subject matter to students. He also makes it all look easy. I regret not having taken a class with him sooner, as I may have been convinced to become an organic chemist. 
More specifically, Rojas performed all of his professorial duties excellently: his lectures were clear, concise, and enjoyable; his use of the blackboard was efficient, neat, even aesthetically beautiful; his course requirements, expectations, and structure was clear; he held daily office hours that were as good, if not better, than having a private tutor; his daily problem sets, solution guides, and posted problem solving videos were incredibly helpful in practice and in preparation for exams; his decision to accompany the course with one of the best and most accessible organic chemistry text books on the market was greatly appreciated (and not the norm); he did all of his own grading of exams and was fair (both of which were much appreciated and not the norm among Columbia science profs); and his exams were challenging, fair, and free of errors. Although the workload was demanding, I felt I could trust in Rojas’ beneficence in all aspects of administering the course (this has also been rare among Columbia science profs). 
I have no complaints about this course. However, I am exhausted after two semesters of organic chemistry. After the many horror stories I’ve heard about organic chemistry classes, I’m pleasantly surprised and grateful to say I enjoyed and will miss Rojas’ class. I wish Professor Rojas all the best moving forward. I would not be surprised if someday he becomes the President of Barnard College.

Professor Gupta is very friendly and approachable. Objectively she's not the most charismatic lecturer, but it's clear she tries very hard. That being said, the course itself was a bit insufficient. Much of the focus was on the history of clinical psychology and backgrounds to respective treatments. The term paper was the only method used to demonstrate your understanding of a respective treatment in application, but had very ambiguous grading. The exams in the class were probably where students had to biggest complaints. They were incredibly poor in design. Many questions were ambiguously worded and were not an objective measure of student's conceptual understanding of theory but rather determinant on subjective interpretations. There were also questions that were entirely meaningless in and of themselves. These questions were simply on arbitrary bullet points on random slides. The information required on these questions would have no contribution to the understanding of the discipline or theories relevant to the field. 
Overall, this was neither a class that discouraged or encouraged anyone's interest in the field of clinical psychology. It was rather a class simply on the historical background on the discipline and tested on random and arbitrary information that were not necessarily reflective of students' knowledge of material and conceptual understanding.

This review is as much about the class as it is about Professor Zoli himself, as the two are inextricably linked. I can't imagine this class being taught as successfully by another professor, nor can I imagine Zoli leading any different sort of class.
Professor Zoli is truly one of a kind: he's at the top of the field in his working profession (bridge design, duh), he possesses vast amounts of knowledge on every imaginable technical and practical aspect of bridge work and the civil engineering industry, and, to put a nice bow on it, he brings it to this class in ways that make the content matter accessible for students with varying backgrounds (undergrad or grad) and with varying areas of interest (construction, steel, concrete, dynamics, etc.). Zoli is an engaging lecturer: slideshows and handouts seem to be the very material he uses in working career, and the design examples and anecdotes are often first-hand from projects that he has personally worked on. Accordingly, he gives life and vibrance to concepts and topics that textbooks (and perhaps other lecturers in this department) would otherwise render dry and abstract. Though Zoli undoubtedly respects, understands, and gives credit to those that undertake Carleton Lab-esque work, his outlook and presentation have a decidedly practical and “real world” slant. Above and beyond the lectures and their content, however, the group project (and Zoli's role in yours) is what distinguishes this class (and its professor) as being truly great.
Lectures and individual problem sets make up roughly the first third of the semester. By halfway through the semester, Zoli asks that the class divide itself up into groups of 4 to 6 people and pick their own topic for a project. The topic consists of an entire bridge that the project group will have to do some/all of the following as part of a conceptual program plan: design, model, tweak, explore, analyze, re-analyze, optimize, critique and summarize. Interested in pedestrian bridges? Interested in curved cable stayed bridges and their performance under cable loss? You name it, Zoli has a plethora of background information and potential bridges/topics, and will guide groups based on the interests and experience levels of individual students. 
As professionally busy as he is, he truly shines in his devotion and accessibility for helping those with their group work. Each group meets multiple times with Zoli to flesh out topics, note progress, and examine difficulties. As deadlines approach, Zoli often works alongside students into the late hours of the night, instructing them in the use of structural analysis software. (Note: there WILL be late hours working in the computer lab, unless your entire group is made up of structural geniuses: there’s always design features to iterate on and refine, and there’s always more technical knowledge to incorporate into your report.) To his credit, he encourages students to help each other learn the software and design techniques from each other. While this may seem like a bunch of hand holding, Zoli seems to strike the right balance between providing information and tools, guiding students in their interests, and setting reasonable expectations for results and reporting.  Groups present a summary of their results in the time slot allotted for the final exam (15 minute .ppt), with (as of Fall 2013) a very refined draft of the report due at the same time. Zoli will formally critique your presentation and design on the spot, and most likely ask the group to revisit aspects of it and incorporate them into a final draft of your paper due at some point over winter break. (Yes, over winter break. Final grades in SSOL are accordingly a bit later than typical.)
While the lack of formal progress deadlines might frustrate some – the ones that do exist are late in the semester, and practically the entire workload for this class IS the group project and presentation – there’s no other course in the CEEM department that I could say that the sky’s limit for. What you get out of this class is profoundly tied to the effort you put in, and the interests of you and your group, and Zoli truly fosters interesting reports and analyses. All in all, a course and experience that should not be overlooked.
