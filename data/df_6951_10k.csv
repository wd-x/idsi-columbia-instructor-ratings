DEAR LORD, SAVE YOURSELF!!!!!!!!!
At first she comes off as this really sweet old lady, with full intentions of helping you learn and appreciate the Spanish language.  Little do you know the amount of time and effort needed to exceed in the class.  If she were the slightest bit exciting or lively, maybe the class might have been a bit more tolerable at 9am.  DO NOT piss this woman off or get on her bad side, b/c she will turn into the most condescending woman alive.  Nothing you do will ever please her.   Tardiness for any reason is unacceptable.  She's not as understanding as she looks.  Be aware!  I've seen she tends to be twice as hard on the native spanish speakers, trying to change the language that they are accustomed to.  In other words, don't take the class if you don't have to.

This was honestly one of the worst classes I've ever taken.  Prof Balsam in some ways does a good job at making the rather dry ideas more accessible through his numerous everyday examples.  However, I do not believe that makes up for his extreme arrogence and self involvement.  The last few weeks of the semester he decided to torture the people who came into class late, which in my opinion was grossly inappropriate, and frustrating to both the people who came in late, and those of us that had come on time.  The lab was by far the worst portion of the class.  The assignments were incredibly time consuming and didn't actually help you learn everything.  Additionally, there were 3 full APA papers, which is ridiculous for a 1.5 credit lab.  The new lab technician (Dr Florer) was unclear in her expectations, and completely inconsistent in her grading.  Although she seems like a nice person, she is highly emotional, and a disaster to have as a prof.  So, unless you have an enormous interest in the psych of learning, I would STRONGLY recommend that you find another class.

Lecture: reasonable, 3 exams.  Lab: average about 5 pages of writing per week in the beginning, and then 3 full APA papers in the second half of the semester.

Justin is very very cool, and not simply because he's buying the class beer after the last day of class, nor because he has a bizarre, hilarious sense of humor that will leave you stifling huge guffaws of laughter in class, but simply because he loves teaching this class. This is one of those few classes at Columbia that was one of the most pleasurable activities all week. If you're a film major, and you're interested in making films (as opposed to writing film criticism), you should enjoy this class, but Justin is such a perceptive, intelligent, articulate instructor that this class absolutely shone. Not only does he know everything you would need to learn in this class, but he knows it like the back of his hand. Even any criticism he may have for your work is expressed out in such an overwhelmingly encouraging manner that it's hard not to thank him secretly for noticing all the little details that you spent so much atttention on while doing your exercises. While he is not afraid to point out your flaws if he thinks you did something wrong, he will make sure to make you laugh twice as hard in class if he thinks you need cheering up. Justin made this class a pleasure. He doesn't really believe in deadlines for the video exercises, so it's easy to get an extension for your work if you want, but exercise caution. I think it depends on what kind of person you are, if you really need deadlines to finish your work, you may find yourself trailing in this class, but if  you're a steady worker, you'll be fine. Justin is by far one of the best instructors I've had at Columbia.

However, Professor Grimm failed to give the class any direction. He was very stiff in class, and wasted a lot of time repeating comments he had already made.

Professor Russell is a very brilliant person: she's well read in political science literature and knows plenty about public policy and social welfare.  However, all of this does not come through in her lectures: she's rather boring, speaks too quickly, and inserts ""UM""s between every few words.  You will leave her class scratching your head trying to find the point of her lecture, and you won't be the only one either: the TAs all agree that her lectures are disorganized and not cohesive at all.  Also, she assigns WAY too much reading for the class, and don't even think of skipping any-it all appears on either the midterm or the final.  Finally, attendance does count (so sign the sheet!), and since this is a 9 AM class, it can be pretty hard to get to class sometimes.  My advice?

Professor Helgeson is a really wonderful teacher. He mediates some very interesting class discussions and tries to give everyone a chance to speak. He's incredibly insightful about the books we read (which are for the most part also good choices), and he always brings up some interesting questions. He tries to tie philosophy into the discussions as well. He's very approachable after class also, which is the best way to speak with him about a certain text. He's very nice and seems to enjoy one-on-one discussions. I recommend this class STRONGLY to anyone who's interested in continuing with French past the advanced language levels.

Some of the claims made of his teaching excellence are factually and demonstrably untrue. He demonstrated no eagerness to meet with students or facilitate their needs. Certain individuals wrote him at the beginning of the semester and received replies in November, two or three months later, with replies amount to little other than ""come to office hours,"" which didn't exist other than ""by appointment,"" rather impossible given the timespan on email replies, and logistically difficult due to an ""office"" perpetually under ""rehabilitation.""
The compensation for this was supposedly the TA sections, although my TA, at least, fell well short of being able to accurately or adequately explain the majority of the material. He consistently stumbled over himself attempting to justify positions or clarify concepts, often conceding to students the work of conveying the material in a more lucid manner. The sections were furthermore poorly scheduled, resulting in some containing over 30 people (hardly an intimate discussion group) and others merely containing two or three. But since by the end of the semester the class body was so consumed by cynicism and apathy due to the abysmal management of this catastrophe of a class, hardly anyone managed to appear for the last few sections. 
The lectures were also sparsely attended. Stacey's proponents claim his detractors must have been the delinquents who failed to appear for the majority of classes, but I struggled to endure each and every TA section and lecture the class offered. The lectures were essentially characterised by Stacey muttering as he scrawled in illegibly tiny letters a facsimile of a lecture outline he'd pre-written and occasionally making some tangential embellishment on them. One classic such outline contained the headline ""what has changed since 9/11?"" with subpoints ""some things"" and ""not much."" At some points I wondered whether or not the kindergarten class I volunteer-taught last spring was capable of more complex and brilliant analysis than Professor Stacey. His explanations of various game-theory models were so cryptic and circular that endless hours of explanation by him and some TAs only ensured most students would be driven made by the ineptitude and futility of his teaching methods. Combined with Stacey's incessant and invariable monotone, his dry explanations, and exhaustion level among class members, the lectures attained the excitement levels of late-night CSPAN. About the only time the pace of the class picked up and the pitch of Stacey's voice eclipsed a dull murmur was when he would launch into one of his self-righteous sermons regarding the unquestionable greatness of globalisation. It also allowed him the opportunity to boast about his experiences as a low-level bureaucrat in various governmental institutions. 
Professor Stacey is obviously having difficulty adjusting to teaching. Still, the gross mockery of academic excellence which was Introduction to International Politics perhaps reveals it is not exactly his vocation. In fact, it was a digraceful, disheartening, and disillusioning experience for anyone involved.

Commitment to academic integrity not necessary- all the exams are take-home, and there's no other accountability on the rather extensive reading requirements.  In essence, one could not read anything, attend none of the lectures, and still write very effective papers and still receive an A-/B+, the standard for a class in which grades are (predictably) rationed.

As with every class, I'm sure there are some students who like and some who dislike Prof. Stacey's teaching style.  I'm in the second camp, and judging by students' class attendance and verbal comments, so are most people.  Prof. Stacey political views clearly come through in his teaching, as each lecture is an effort to bolster one idea.  For example, his point about the relationship between Islam and the West; he claimed that the antagonism is a purely recent phenomenon.  When one student raised a point about the Crusades, it was glossed over with the reply that, essentially, ""Those events happened too long ago to be useful"".  He then proceeded to state that, in places and times where christians and muslims have lived together, there was not really antagonism, before the 20th century.  He then claimed that, essentially, those people who point to 19th century Turkey, Greece, Egypt, and any number of Balkan countries, are not thinking like social scientists.  This type of class discussion is not peculiar to that one class; its just one example of a ubiquitous phenomenon.
Dont let the name of the class fool you; although its called ""Into to International Politics"", it is in fact ""Into to American Foreign Policy"".  There is zero discussion of politics between and within states where America has never fought, like conflicts in 1994 Rwanda, East Timor, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, the DRC, and any number of other states.   He claimed that examining US policy was the best way to ""get out of the theory and get our feet on the ground"".  It seems to me that the best way to isolate the social variables of wealth, cultural attitudes, and traditional allegiances is to examine many different countries and scenarios.  Apparently not. 
In short, if you're looking for a thorough, analytical approach to international politics, and if you're looking for an INTERNATIONAL approach to international politics, dont take this class.  If you'd like to stick with the safe arguments, look at the situations from one side, and watch other students get ignored for making valid points, register for V1601.

This woman is amazing. TAKE THIS CLASS! You wonÂ’t regret it! Not only does it fulfill a number of requirements, but also Professor West makes the class fun to go to. What can I say? Her lectures are enthralling and sometimes I wish I didnÂ’t have to take notes just so I can sit and bask in her speaking. Though for an intro class, there is a whole load of theory, which sometimes gets confusing but donÂ’t worry about it. Professor West and the TAÂ’s make the material highly accessible for those who never had background in anthropology. I feel like sheÂ’s the only professor IÂ’ve had that truly understands her students, telling us once or possibly more times that as Columbia students we should have a little fun and not worry so much. SheÂ’s funny, sheÂ’s hip and sheÂ’s just so cool. Her lectures are clear, organized and yes they do relate to the reading (though sometimes it did not follow the syllabus).  I recommend that you take this class or any class Professor West is teaching, though she is on leave next year. This class changed the way I saw the world and itÂ’s really how I imagined a college class to be and more so. Though, there are some students that complain about this class, maybe it is because of the question and answer times, but I say itÂ’s all worth it. The class is easy, but you will have to do the readings (most of them anyway) if you want to do really well. I'm really going to miss this class.

I really enjoyed this class.  I had no trouble staying awake.  At times the material seemed to be ""dumbed down"" but she is a good lecturer overall.
My only complaint is about the tests.  They are not difficult to study for since the TAs give out a review sheet so you know exactly what to read in the textbook and Dweck herself runs an in-class review session of the lecture material.  But, all the grading is done by TAs, including undergrad TAs and it is very uneven.  For example, no single test is graded completely by one person.  The TAs divy up the questions and then grade their questions on everyone's tests.  This results in odd point patterns with some TAs (there were 3 my semester) grading more harshly than others.  It's painful to lose all your points consistently on the questions graded by the same TA test after test.  FYI I am getting an A minus so it didn't hurt me so much as annoyed me.

In response to the previous review about the Fall 2003 course with Prof. Nathan and Shareen Hertel, it was unfair and not in the spirit of the class.  Prof. Nathan made the point that in fact, when the UDHR was written, people with handicaps tried to play them down, including the president, and the first drafter.  It's a historical perspective.  The student in referring to the first drafter who wrote it with only one arm seemed to be referring to the idea that because the first drafter was handicapped, he would naturally include consideration for that.  The TAs along with the professors set a great example of freedom of speech and opinion, and sometimes even entertained us with their differing points of view on topics.  Students are free to express themselves in class and discussions.  It is not appropriate to sound off with pet peeves that the previous critic has, that should, in reality, have been thrashed out first with the students and/or profs in class or groups.  The judgments are just as stupid as the projection upon the professor, who is brilliant, kind and friendly.   A good class.

If you can stay awake through his letures, Professor Amdur is extremely easy to understand.  He always opens lecture with a review of the last one (which helps if you skipped a lecture), and he constantly references the text when teaching (which helps if you didn't do the reading).  His only weakness: his lectures can be extremely boring.  He discourages students from asking questions during the lecture, which usually leads to 50-60 minutes of uninterrupted droning on Locke, Hobbes, or another important political thinker.  Many people fall asleep during these lectures.  However, he almost always reserves the last 10-15 min. of class for questions and sometimes lets the class go early.

I liked the material in principles, but O'Flaherty was a major disappointment.  His lectures always took one of two bad paths, the second worst than the first.  In the former case, he would lecture on situations to which the material in the textbook could be applied without mentioning the textbook material directly.  These lectures were informative, but became hopelessly stalled by frivolous questions from people who couldn't understand the lecture because they didn't do the reading from the textbook.  O'Flaherty would sometimes spend 20 minutes repeating the same point when answering questions from these people.  In the latter case, he would simply repeat the material in the textbook and still repeat himself several times in response to frivolous questions from non-readers.  These lectures were a waste of time, pure and simple.  If you're going to take Principles and are serious, avoid this guy because the lectures never turn out very well.

Jeff Phan is one of the few math teachers I've ever had who actually made it worthwhile.  He was the most approachable professor I've had thus far, especially in a lecture class like calculus.  His goal was to make sure all of his students understood the material, not get through the necessary chapters.  He was willing to work his lesson plan around our needs.  There were always enough in-class examples, throroughly explained to make the homework much more doable. He was also just really funny, enjoyable, and easy to learn from.  Awesome class overall!

OK, a couple points. First, to stacey's credit the material is not the most interesting. I love politics and i find myself dosing during his class. And the simulations were an attempt to break from the usual lecture. Also, in class stacey tried. He lectured, tried to be engaging, and invited us to hear speakers w/ him.  He's trying.
         On the other hand. He was the most inaccessible human being alive. You could not get an appointment w/ him. He also would not grade any papers himself. left them all to ta's so it took forever to get back. Lastly, he is a boring dude. 
       I have no real beef with stacey. Not my favorite person, but i dont hate him like poeple. I just dont recommend the class and if you're going to take it....dont take it w/ him.

I got to say, I started this course with no idea what Hermeneutics is. Having finished it, I still couldnÂ’t give you a good definition. But, amazingly, it doesnÂ’t matter. It was perhaps the most informative class I have had about twentieth century philosophy. The whole gang was there, if not in text than in spirit: Heidegger, Kuhn, Foucault. The class was an arcane mixture of Philosophy of History, Critical Theory, and general bizzaro methodology. Only Taylor Carmen could ever pull this kind of voodoo, and it is a testament to his incredible teaching ability. I hope he is given more free reign to conduct similar classes in the future because he has so much insight into what other teachers could only present as gibberish.

Frey is a great teacher and all around nice guy. His lectures are almost always interesting, and the course deals with one of the thorniest issues in recent history, namely the Holocaust.

Ms. Wallack is a highly intelligent person and generally has a good teaching style.  But, with both her teaching and commenting/grading on essays, she tends to deconstruct ideas and statements to the point which one feels he has to write an entirely new essay.  She is an extremely harsh grader, and will push you to your limit until you have exhausted the subject and the current assignment at hand.  Depending on how you see it, this could either be a good or bad thing.  Other U.Writ instructors are much more lenient and don't grade at such a high level - so getting an A in this class is not an esay task, but, at the same time, you do actually learn to refine your thinking and write at a higher level.  To put it this way, I hated the class while taking it, but now I am so grateful.  Yes, Ms. Wallack is really tough, and doesn't take s**t (like late papers, bad papers, etc), but she is a human being and gives a lot of feedback and consideration, including extensions, to her students.

I feel obligated to post this review since the previous reviews were so positive.  I am writing this review before taking the final, so I dont know my grade, but am expecting to get an A.  so there is no ulterior motive for my review.
     I found this man terribly annoying.  His lecturing style was choppy and erratic.  He often mispronounced words without clarification and glossed over more difficult concepts and problems because he realized that his explanations were not correct.  I really got the feeling that he was in class not for the students, but to hear himself talk.  I mean, the guy was able to get the general material across, and its not very hard to get an A, but hes just so annoying!  After every slide he finishes with ""clear . . . questions . . . ok.""  In one on one interaction, he was very arrogant and condescending.  I mean the class is pretty easy but hes just like nails on a chalkboard.  For the first half of the semester, when we deal with accounting, he pronounced ""retained earnings"" as ""returned  earnings"".  
  So while this class is pretty easy, and the book teaches you a lot, Amir Rozen makes the lecture experiences painful.  My own personal opinion, but had I met this guy before taking the class, I would have taken the other section.

~bi-weekly psets, sometimes arbitrary grading.  midterm, akwardly worded questions that at times test how well you can understand what hes trying to say and not accounting knowledge.  projects, 2 projects, one really easy, the other is a financial analysis of 2 companies.  havent gotten my grade back but it was a pain to write.  final . . .  we'll see!

I agree with the other reviewers, exceit I wont even give Russell credit for knowing her stuff. She's not too bright - and her overarching themes are obvious and redundant. But the worst part of this class - which may be the worst polisci class at Columbia - is that she makes it impossible to take notes, because her sentences come out in gibberish. A typical lecture sounds like: ""Um, um um , uhhh, so Reagan, no, Bush, um, Clinton, proposed, um, opposed, um said, um passed a bill, um to stop, um start, continue, um, welfare reform."" This is not an exageration. And then there is also the expected liberal slant, so that whatever Saint Clinton did was great and whatever Bush or Reagan did was horrible. Just plain horrible class.

Out of the 25+ professors I have had, Professor Cannon is probably one of the WORST professors I have ever had.

This is the second year the course has been given, and this syllabus provided a variety of class experiences.  There were lectures twice a week, including many guest lecturers successful in the field.  There is a lot of student participation compared to most introductory courses, with discussion in the lecture, some times more than others, and there was a weekly discussion group for each TA (3 of them), not obligatory, but interesting, helpful, and fun.   Profs. Nathan and Hertel both provided 2-hour office hours, as well as TAs.  There is support from the TAs, profs and the human rights undergraduate staff if you want to take advantage of it.  The core of human rights, we learn,  is respecting human dignity, which is pretty much repeated in all major human rights documents, Prof. Nathan is an extraordinary professor, he likes to teach and to encourage students, and he started this course, and without him, none of the other political science TAs, who were immensely popular assisting him in this class, and Prof. Hertel, who just obtained her PhD here,  would have had an opportunity to show themselves to us.  A final point made about the class by a TA was that she hoped students should take away a sense of what human rights are and how they can add to that debate with their own concerns about rights.  For that reason alone, It is a very worthwhile class, providing a really rare and desirable academic foundation.

The reviews critical of Bruce are clearly written by people who aren't interested in macroeconomics. Listen, if you're looking for a song and dance, or for a teacher who tells lots of anecdotes about his thirty years working at the Council of Economic Advisors, or a professor who adheres closely to some ideological view of the world, then sure, this isn't the class for you. But if you're interested in really understanding the framework for macroeconomic analysis, then Bruce is excellent. He's clear, he gives a thorough and repeated explanations (which is very helpfu in a class where the theories are not always intuitive or simple) and he's more than willing to answer individual questions during office hours. 
Bruce is a young guy - he just got his doctorate from Princeton. This was his first time teaching the class. Anybody that's taught before knows that it isn't simple to produce your first syllabus. Near the end of the course, we start applying the theories towards current events, which is very fun. Although it's true that Bruce stuck closely to the book, I know for a fact (he told me) that he's planning on expanding such analysis in future classes. The book is a good text - sticking to it while laying the theoretical groundwork is very helpful, in fact, because it allows students to use the text to compliment the lectures, and it makes homework sets more applicable. There are different ways of understanding the economy, and if Bruce were giving a drastically different model than what the book used, that wouldn't be too good, would it?
If you like thinking about economics, and understanding the way models work (or don't work), the Bruce is a good professor. And I can only see him getting better. Why? Because he's exceptionally intelligent and he's nuanced in his understanding of the material.

This course, which had the potential for being a very good class, was a total waste of my time.  Although I enjoyed the out of class performances, I took very little away from the class.  Professor Garafola has obvious favorites in the class, which often felt like a private conversation between her and the dancers in the class, leaving the majority of students completely left out.  Class had little structure- Professor Garafola enjoyed going off on tangents, and the lectures often seemed to have nothing to do with the reading. When she did follow some kind of lesson plan, she read straight off her notes in a voice that was so obviously forced and fake that I found it almost unbearable to listen to her. Although Professor Garafola is obviously knowledgeable about her field and has a lot of experience with it, she did a horrible job of imparting that knowledge upon her students. I would not recommend this class to anyone who's not a dancer- someone actually made a comment in class that ""you have to be a dancer to appreciate dance,"" and Professor Garafola nodded along. A lot of students LOVE Professor Garafola (and she really is a good person), but think very carefully before taking this class.

Secondly, the class was almost always lively, because she was fantastic at facilitating and never letting the conversation go dead and get awkward. 
She rephrases what students are trying to say into something that really makes sense and, although not big on comments on papers, will always see a student who has a question or wants to discuss an assignment. 
I love her! I'm just upset she's not teaching more classes for me to take next semester.

Professor Richard is fantastic. She is nice and funny, and can keep class interesting even when discussing the boring biological basis of psychology. She gives the students an outline for every chapter which focuses on what is important to know (unlike other teachers, who just express a vague idea of what they will put on the tests, etc.) and doesn't test on anything beyond the outlines. 
She's great. Definitely take her class.

Professor MacAdam is the best. He's slightly intimidating because he's so obviously brilliant and knows what he wants from the students, but he is funny and fantastic. He has great things to say about the books and really great connections to make. Each class, he goes over the previous night's reading so it is all very clear (even if Spanish is not your native language and Borges is a bit confusing!). He demands a lot and asks for class participation, but he is really wonderful. He adds personal anecdotes and bits of outside information to make every lecture great.

I don't care what anyone else says, Professor West is an amazing teacher. Yes, she is openly left-leaning and has very strong convictions that come through in her lectures, but she frequently encourages students to dissent, debate, and disagree with her, to form their own opinions and not just accept hers blindly. The outside reading is not completely relevant as they're not discussed in class, but the T.A.s are really helpful in the discussion sections in terms of forming connections between the readings and broader anthropology. Anyway, I would definitely recommend Professor West, and not just because she plays cool music as people are filing into class, wears great clothing (like a mini-skirt and cowboy boots), and shows ""Bladerunner"" for two classes. 
She is smart, funny, interesting, and incredibly passionate about what she does.

Prof. Cynn is very, very intelligent and can seem a little intimidating because she just knows everything.  Her class is very business-like and she never says anything that isn't related to the work at hand.  This is probably good if you like that sort of learning environment, but if you are looking to have a friendly teacher-student relationship, you will be disappointed.  I actually found her to be sort of creepy, but maybe that's just me.  The work isn't too daunting -- except when she assigns a paper and a TON of (unrelated) reading at the same time.

Switch out of the section if you have him. Arne is not a mean person; he just makes the lab class ridiculously difficult. He curves around B/B+ for every lab report with most students falling around the middle. (Don't dismiss this just because I talk about grades--read on.) For most of you that means however hard you try you will find yourself getting scores between 4.8 and 5.2 (over 10.0) every single time. You may work harder, but so will everyone else. By the end of the semester the curve becomes insanely competitive.
Now, I don't think that students should only care about grades, but I personally (and I would venture to guess that most people will agree) don't think it makes sense to curve physics lab like Arne does. First of all, although he thinks he never makes mistakes (he said it himself), evaluation of lab reports isn't numerical and objective. Does it make sense to curve essays? And unless it's something major, he doesn't really tell you what is wrong with your work. You can be doing flawless reports and still getting 4.8's and not knowing why (because the other reports are spectacular).  More importantly, there is absolutely NO point making an INTRODUCTORY lab class so insanely competitive. Every lab report took me 5/6 hours of stressful work, and every time I got a 5.0 back (all checks, no mistakes), not because it wasn't good, but because everyone else's was just as good. Words cannot describe the extreme frustration and pain this class brought upon me.
I would MUCH rather take a harder class (even get a worse grade) than suffering through this shyt. At least that could be interesting and I would actually learn something. The physics lab material is boring as hell, and Arne makes things worse by insisting on meticulous error analyses. Whatever you might get out of this class (very little in my case) would not be worth the extreme torture it entails. Get out.

Prof. Edlund is very middle-of-the-road.  On the one hand, she runs the class as though it were high school: she takes attendance, learns your name, employs (relatively) current events, and frequently has the class pair off to discuss some topic or work on a problem.  On the other hand, she realizes that her students are in fact adults, and she treats them as such.  Her teaching style is not particularly thrilling, and she won't turn you on to labor economics (will anyone?)...but she is always happy to answer questions, and she'll even look up the answer on her own if she doesn't know right away.  She's also very concerned with her performance - she gave two informal class evals in addition to the official one at the end of the semester, and she even videotaped a lecture or two (for her own personal use, of course).  Overall, if you don't mind a little discussion with your lectures or the fact that class participation counts for 10% of your grade, you won't be disappointed.

Great prof, as I'm sure you can see from the previous comments. He might be a bit rough on your GPA, though. That's why I'd like to pass along a hint I got from a previous student - one that has served me well: On his syllabi, you'll find a list of secondary texts. Pick a section from one of those texts that is relevant to whatever essay topic you've chosen (often the texts are collections of short essays, so just choose one of them) and then just rehash the argument. Instant A minus. 
Carman punishes students more than most professors for reaching too far with an argument and saying something incorrect, and he doesn't place very much emphasis on originality. He wants you to have a concise argument that's actually supported by the text - that's it, no more. Also, as I'm sure you know, rehashing an intelligent argument is as good a way to learn as any.
Use it wisely, grasshopper.

Ok, I went into this class thinking (like the other 200+people) that would be an easy A as well as covering fairly interesting subject matter. I can honestly say that I was not satisfied in either respect. I only skipped two lectures, but in retrospect, there really is no point in going to class becuase he is very boring (albeit he does make some funny jokes, if that's what you're into) and unnecessarily concentrates on his own field of psychophysics. Overall a very dry class with way too much reader assigned that I don't think anyone ever did.

Yes, the three quizzes are open book, but before you shout for joy realize that this will not help you at all. Questions (which are supposed to be answered by a mysterious ""mark incorrect"" method"") are extremely tricky, confusing and 90% of the time rely on material that wasn't adequately discussed in class, and that reading would need to be done for. Also, you have to go to 3 hrs of psych experiments, which at the end turned out to be a sort of extra credit thing. I honestly don't know how many people will get an A in the class (after seeing my quiz scores, I wisely decided to play it safe and take the class p/f) but it is most certainly NOT an easy A.

Marie Regan is the only professor I have had in 2 years of Barnard and Columbia classes that has made the time and money I've spent here worthwhile.  She is engaging and engaged with her material, she knows the films she discusses well - both in technique and in history; she is open to students' comments and still manages to keep the class moving at a good pace (for a 4 hour class this is VERY important).  AND, though teaching 2 classes of something like 50+ students, plus pursuing her own interests outside of class, she still managed to know the names of almost everyone in my class of ~80 people by the end of the term (which is not to say she will coddle you, she expects the work to get done on time). 
The exam questions (which apparently previously were unreasonable) seemed to me quite reasonable, and I only felt constricted for time on one of the 2 in-class exams. 
I would recommend this class to anyone interested in starting to study film, and this professor to anyone interested in taking a class that will be worth your time and effort.

Often, it is only at the end of the semester that one is able to accurately appraise a professor.  I understand the negative reviews that have been posted over the course of this semester.  They have attacked Stacey's teaching style, personality, and intellect, and for much of the semester I would have agreed with them.  I didn't like him and I didn't like his style.  Still, I find now that I have learned a great deal more than I have in many classes I've enjoyed more, and for that I am grateful.  The measure of the course should not be how lenient the grading was or how entertaining the lectures were but rather how much the student is able to take away at the end of the semester.  I thank Professor Stacey for doing his best to bring a large body of material across to his students, and I commend him for being an extremely effective teacher.  The class wasn't fun, but that's not what it's for.
As a side note - some of the reviews have attacked Stacey for an inadequate understanding of international politics and for holding to a particular point of view in the face of the student criticism.  To these reviewers:
1. You are an undergraduate.  Read Stacey's CV - he knows what he's talking about.
2. Anyone who has ever taught can appreciate the difficulties of dealing with pretentious students more interested in proving their own intelligence than in learning something.  In an introductory course with dozens of students it is wholly appropriate to keep discussion to a minimum so the material can be covered.  That's why he have discussion sections.

Here's the bottom line on the prof and the class. The class is more than a standard db offering in terms of workload: you got to do two projects, a web based db app and another theory-type number cruncher (most db classes make you do that one big app as a term project). There's also homeworks, mostly easy, with an occasional twist. If you go to class, do the projects/homework and score above avg in the exams, you're guaranteed a B+. One caution sign I'd post is: don't ignore the prereqs. You *need* to know how to code, and you *need* to know some data structure stuff. Don't screw around on this one, or you'll run into trouble in the projects. Gravano is basically a good guy. He does his best to help you out (even tho he appears touchy in class when cellphones ring, laptops ping etc, and you got to get used to the self-deprecating humor bit.) He's cool in office hours and email too (he gave several important hints on the second project ... this was a *huge* help after I spent like a whole weekend going blind on the numbers.) Overall, low stress class and he's a decent guy.

Hands down Paul is the best professor suited for this job! Just recently discovered and hired by Barnard, he engages the class lucidly in the work through his eccentric and humorous examples and mannerisms. As for the class work itself, it is only doing the readings, and even if you don't read them before class or perhaps ever (scanning works to but the readings happen to be so fascinating you'll WANT to read them!) you will be perfectly fine because Paul points out exactly what is important from them! Also, he incorporates examples from his own dissertation with the Q'eqchi Mayans and it is amazingly engaging and interesting, while he is also known to go off on how important some features of speech are, compares it to the importance of our hands and then bites the projector ilustrating how those are important!

My opinion: the course is not hard, the prof is good.
Course covers all the basic db stuff. Most of the material is from the textbook. If you don't know programming you'll have a tough time so make sure you have the prereqs. The first project is a standard web/db app (what most db classes make you do). The second one is a number-cruncher type deal, it sounds kind of complex, but really is easy once you figure out the concepts.
Gravano is approachable and easy. Great in office hours, explained the 2nd project very clearly, I had no trouble running right into the lab and finishing it up. He also responds promptly to email. All in all, a kind soul like the other review said, tries to help you out as much as possible.

Ok, I'm not quite sure what wacky CULPA drama has been going on, but all these Stacey reviews are ridiculous. I doubt there are even this many people qualified enough to review him since almost no one even came to lectures. However, as someone who did, I can tell you that (Professor) Stacey is a mediocre teacher-- inexpereinced and arrogant, but with very interesting material and readings to back him up. Anyone who thinks this is the best class at Columbia has been taking the wrong classes, although there isn't a huge range of grades (B to A- mostly) and Stacey does work to tie in current events (although sometimes odd, vague ones).  So, if you have an interest (and some prior knowledge) in international politics, plus a fascination with theories, go ahead and take Stacey's class. You won't be on the edge of your seat during lectures (actually, you probably won't show  cause everything is takehome), but it takes care of the poli sci intro requirement. Overall, good subject matter with a poor professor -- take your chances. Oh and my TA kicked ass, which make all the difference since they grade everything and re-explain his lectures for those who don't show up (or those who did and were still lost).

Professor Kitcher is phenomenal (But how is she noumenally you might ask? [please shoot me]).

IÂ’m sure this would have been a good course if 1) I were interested in Ethics or Psychology, or 2) I were just starting out in philosophy. As it was, I found the course to be broad not deep. I was vaguely hoping that it wouldnÂ’t be a survey course (since Moral Philosophy is already one), but it was, with all the Kantian and Utilitarian and Virtue Ethical baggage that comes with such a course. Professor Beardman provided lovely little summaries of the readings but little else.  Her obsession with short papers also hindered real thought development (though IÂ’m sure it prevented many a mental train-wreck as well).

Discussion sections included her spending a few minutes succinctly clarifying whatever the professor had confused in class, and then leading discussion in a way that both helped confused students get a good grasp on the issues and those with outside knowledge or strong opinions contribute in a productive way. She is great at synthesizing what people are saying and helping them sort out their own arguments, even on issues that arenÂ’t her specialty.

I truely found Kosto to know a lot, but he treats his students as if they were freshman in high school.  I realize this is a thousand level course, but teaching students how to write a thesis sentence, read a primary source, and write coherent sentences takes up a large junk of time.  His lectures are EXTREMELY organized.  You'd have to be an idiot to not know what was going on.  He writes everything on the board, as a high school teacher would, in outline form.  He has an excellent sense of humor.  His view of history is to question everything and look at everything in the context of knowing the people in history really didn't know what would happen next.  These points are stressed.  If you only study notes, expect a B- to B+ in his class, if you want better, take notes on the readings, divide the readings up with friends, and kiss butt to your TA.

Don't expect the TA's to debug your problems and don't expect the prof to give much help except conceptual stuff.

I loved this course.  Professor Nayar is an excellent lecturer.  He provides the class with handouts containing almost every slide he uses (yes, he uses slides on a projector, which is usually a bad sign, but he pulls it off well)... over 400 pages per student across the term.  This minimizes how much you have to take down in terms of notes, and allows you to spend more of the lecture making sure you understand, rather than copying down diagrams.
I have to agree with the previous review: Professor Nayar's digressions are always interesting, and regardless of whether they help understand the material, they help understand the motivations, or how vision works in humans.
It's not an easy class, but if you come to lecture all the time and pay attention, you shouldn't have trouble with the homeworks...

This is a spectacular class!
It's officially limited to 30, and there's a chance you'll have to compete somewhat for a spot in the class, but that's rare - my class had 23 or so people at the beginning, and ended up at 21 for the bulk of the term.
Unlike most CS classes, Programming & Problem Solving is a discussion-based class.  There are four projects across the term (each covering about 3 weeks).  There are 5 discussion classes per problem (in which the class demos their latest solutions and discusses their approaches), and one class where each group presents their report.
Groups are randomly determined, but you can request to work with particular students (but you can only work with each person on ONE project).  The groundwork for the problem-solving has been done for you - the TA provides the class with a simulator program and the interface for your code to use, so you can dive in and typically write a simple/naive solution to the problem in twenty minutes or so, leaving you most of the project time to create and implement more complex solutions - there is almost no setup work.
The class works on full disclosure and full sharing - you can take any code you find online and use it, as long as you say you did, and you can rip off your classmates as much as you want, as long as you credit them for what you ripped off.
One of the great things about this class is that it brings you into a group of some of the best minds currently studying at the school.  It will have you thinking differently about all sorts of problems.  The other great thing about the class is how I always left the discussions wanting to work on the project - unlike most classes where the assignments are fairly arbitrary, you have a great deal of leeway in the deliverable, and typically you have something you want to try.
I would recomend this class to anybody who feels comfortable with a discussion-
oriented problem-solving case study.
Also, I would reccomend Professor Ross' databases course - he is an excellent professor.

Professor Sanchez has a great passion for the subject but unfortunately is extremely unprofessional and un-academic in his teaching.  The lectures are rambling and disorganized as he often forgets what he is talking about in the middle of a speach, and is more preoccupied with hand motions and pacing than saying anything of substance.  His grading is based on a rubric with no care for writing style or original ideas.  He lacks integrity and demands no respect.

Professor Elizabeth Bernstein is by far the worst educator that I have ever encountered. I thought that Sociology of Gender would be an informative and interesting class about the ways in which the issue of gender pervades our society. However, the class was utterly dull and consisted of Professor Bernstein reciting verbatim from reading assignments in a monotone voice. She gave her sociological research utmost importance and seemed to enjoy pounding it into each student's head that men are useless creatures. Professor Bernstein was always condescending, unapproachable, and dismissive. She in no way made the class enjoyable. Her assignments were utterly ridiculous especially the final take-home examination which was tedious, long, and difficult to do in only two weeks time. Even other professors with whom I discussed the project thought that it was ludicrous. Also, your grade suffers if you do not frame your agruments exactly as she would. If you want to get anywhere in this course, agreeing with Professor Bernstein is a must if you wish to survive. If you have nothing better to do with your time thatn to do drawn out take-home examinations, agree with the preposterous claims of a woman who hasn't discovered colors other than black, and enjoy having personal propaganda implanted into your brain then this is the course for you. If you are a free thinker who prefers not to be spoonfed and patronized then try your luck elsewhere.

I'm flabbergasted by the negative reviews of Katie I've read here. She is easily the best professor I've had on EITHER side of the street during my four years here. Yes, her strength is modern dance, but that doesn't make her any less of a ballet dancer or teacher. She is wonderful and knows how to give combinations that are both challenging and fun. She uses ""SAT words"" not because she is trying to prove anything, but because she is an articulate professor with a Columbia English degree who conveys her ideas in a manner suiteable for a college classroom. (Other professors use ""big words"" too - why should a dance teacher be any different?) And for the people who think she plays favorites - I definitely disagree. I think she encourages and corrects everyone quite a bit. There are certain students who keep returning to her class semester after semester (because it's good), so of course she's going to be able to work with them on a deeper level - she is already familiar with their strengths and weaknesses as dancers. 
In short, Katie is a wonderful teacher and person. You're crazy if you don't give her a try, whether you're a first-time dancer or an ex-SAB student. She is a gem. Take her class.

Although she had a tendency to speak very fast, she was willing to slow down for some of the students who were less fluent and even explicate some vocab and idioms.

She's also quite demanding in terms of the amount of work we put into this class (she expects at least four hours a session??)  but if you do that, you end up getting a lot out of it.   Prof von Mucke is absolutely brilliant and not condescending at all, we felt very comfortable posing questions and stating comments at any time.

Prof Aloff, or rather Mindy as she doesn't mind being called, was sadly not a really great seminar teacher. Many times, our classes were quite uneventful as certain students would hijack the debates and perhaps try to impose their viewpoints on us while Mindy would merely nod and let the inane arguements go on. That was rather frustrating, but surprisingly, the last few lessons we had with her were quite wonderful. She was engaged with the discussions and gave a lot of insight into the texts we were reading. Therefore, if you do have her, do try to cut her some slack and don't be too surprised when she says something really though-provoking, forcing you to suddenly pay attention. Yes, she does make many valid points. It's just such a pity that our class was unable to overlook her focus on dance and the rather unorganized class format to see that. It was even more of a pity that she did not begin the course the way she handled our last few lessons. Hopefully the next time she teaches a seminar class, she would be better. Gradingwise, there were mixed opinions(inclining towards the easy side) though she does pay a great deal of attention on the intracasies in grammar and such so be sure to proofread. Overall, Mindy is a really sweet lady so if you're willing to take the effort to really listen to what she has to say, then this class could go quite well for you.

   I am definitely in agreement with all the other positive reviews, so it's hardly worth repeating all the compliments, but I can't resist taking the opportunity to give due praise to one of the best (and probably the best) professor I've had so far at Columbia (I am a Math major and a Physics minor, however, so maybe I have lower standards).
   Anyway, let me start with the class itself.  The three main authors (Gadamer, Danto, Foucault) were a great cross-section of the various strands of contemporary philosophy of language, history, and society, and also form some interesting continuities (although the loose, Continental approach we took in the class could turn anything into a continuity, no matter how much Foucault would turn in his grave).  The topics we addressed ranged from the ontology of language to the sociology of everyday life (through Bourdieu, who was added to the syllabus at the end since we finished ahead of time), and there wasn't a single lecture that wasn't captivating for less than half the duration of the class.
   This brings me to Professor Carman himself.  He's probably the most lucid, reasonable, and entertaining lecturer I've ever had (except for John Collins on the latter point--sorry, but it's true), and there wasn't a single concept he discussed of which I didn't have a clear understanding following a lecture or two on it.
   I certainly plan to take any other course he offers in the remaining two semesters I'm here (unfortunately, he's not teaching anything in Spring 2004), and recommend that you do too, whether you're a philosophy major, just slightly interested in the field, or even if you know nothing about it, although in that case you'll certainly have trouble with the papers.  So audit it then, if he'll let you (this class was pretty small, but 19th Century is usually big, I think).
   I could go on... (and will, for just a little bit).  One unique characteristic Carman has is an uncanny skill for improvisation & stream-of-consciousness philosophizing.  Far from being tangential or confusing, this style conveyed (with utmost clarity and coherence) an amazing interdepartmental, international web of ideas that constitutes a large part of modern theory.
   The only negative aspects of Professor Carman are 1) his slightly disorganized syllabus, or rather his lack of sticking to it completely rigorously--and yet I really can't complain, because it allowed for the fluidity I praised in the last paragraph, and 2) his susceptibility to being derailed from his crazy train by inane or naive questions (though I must say, I was probably responsible for some of these), but this was never horribly harmful to the structure of the course, so I suppose it could be construed as yet another virtue of his: he'll listen to anyone's ideas, and set them on the right course when necessary (which was almost always the case).
   Alright, that's all; sorry for the long sentences and parentheses, but that's philosophy for you.

I wrote a review here several months ago, but I wanted to put in one final word on what I believe happened this semester in Intro. to International Politics.  Professor Stacey, a very intelligent man but a tragically inexperienced teacher, initially taught his class in a boring and derivative manner.  Cynicism and apathy welled within the students taking the class (yes, I attended almost all of the lectures and listened during class, and yes, I still hated being there).   A few of these students wrote unfavorable, and sometimes scathing and unproductive, reviews on CULPA.  An article in the ""Spectator"" mentioned these reviews and was read by everyone in the class.  Professor Stacey, I believe, also read this article and the CULPA reviews, but he remained completely calm and upbeat in the face of this rather sudden (and, I add now, inappropriate) assault.  He took it in the best, most mature way possible: he simply made his class more interesting.  The last three classes were truly fun.  After attending these three classes and reading the article in the Spec, students (at least those I talked to) felt tremendously guilty.  Perhaps as a way to expurgate this guilt, they posted absolutely gushing over-the-top rave reviews on CULPA that condemned those students who had written the initial scathing reviews, even though nearly everyone, EVERYONE I talked to early in the semester was dissatisfied with the class.  Students in this class experienced myriad emotions this semester, seesawing back and forth from apathy to anger to guilt to...eventual satisfaction, kind of.  I think everyone who participated in this class learned some important things.  I learned never to use CULPA in the heat of the moment to slam a professor who bores you.  Massive bad karma all around...it's immature.  I personally feel stupid now for writing the review I did.  But you know what?  I think all the bad reviews led to a good end.  Professor Stacey improved -- dramatically -- and I don't think he'll ever be boring again.  Kudos to Professor Stacey for being a faster and more levelheaded learner than we students.

While I would agree with previous reviews that Prof. Onatski teaches a heavily math-based class, his class his certainly not a math gulag like one of the reviews suggests. I only took one math class at Columbia (IIA) before taking macro, and I did lousy in it. Nonetheless, I managed Onatski's class with an A (even though I was convinced I had failed the final before I got my grade). While I am not the biggest fan of math or macro, I would still highly recommend Prof. Onatski. He's entertaining, thoughtful, and will always leave you with another speculative scheme with which you can cheat the world! I am now approaching my final in Micro, though, and I can honestly say that Onatski's class makes this one seem like cake. But you'll learn from it (if not from the incompetent TAs).

Terrible, terrible, terrible. Classtime is totally useless and boring, assignments are totally useless and boring. There is no discussion of texts, and no real explanation of them either. So, if you're actually interested in learning anything that this course is supposed to teach you, you should avoid this class. He lets whoever wants to babble on about whatever, and then in the last ten minutes of class, he tells the 'correct' interpretation of the text. The essay questions and midterm and final questions, which are supposed to comparing several texts to each other using common themes between them, were always about only one text. So, if you read everything except, say  ""Utilitarianism"", you're screwed. Also, Couch ( I'm fairly sure) is interested in the philosophy of science, so all the extra texts we read had to do with that. He doesn't take attendance though, which is nice, I suppose.

This class, and this professor, epitomized what I always imagined my college experience to be.  As a first-semester freshman, my first day of class (and many subsequent days, as well) were quite intimidating, but the extra effort was 100% worthwhile.  The syllabus is incredible and Professor Vandenburg is absolutely brilliant, not to mention approachable, helpful and funny.  Although the class has about 60 people she manages to run it as a seminar, appreciative of every contribution.  Entirely in awe of her, I found myself--and got the impression that others did the same--making sure that my comments were well thought-out and had evidence to back them.  Because the majority of students seemed to make the same effort, the class level was very high and I appreciated others' comments almost as much as Prof. Vandenburg's explanations.  Something I particularly liked about her is the way in which she is always supportive of a student's contribution to the discussion.  Not once throughout the semester did I see her make anyone feel at all uncomfortable or unintelligent.  Even if a student said something blatantly incorrect, she managed to manipulate it in a supportive manner to correct the statement without acknowledging the fact that they had made a mistake.  This class was absolutely amazing; I found myself raving about it to all my friends, family members and even past teachers.

The reviewers who claimed that Prof. Lean's course is a waste of time are pretentious.  The class provides a clear and organized overview of  Chinese History, and the 5-10 min review she does in the beginning of each class makes the material very understandable and makes studying much easier.  In a class of 100, when she would ask admittedly basic questions merely to make sure that the material from the day before was clear, students would roll their eyes and mutter that the review was unecessary, yet, by not answering her questions they were merely prolonging the wait for new material! Prof. Lean is nice, approachable, funny, and very knowledgable about Chinese History.  The TA discussions were a total waste of time, but I liked the textbook and the lectures.

It didn't surprise me to find out this was Heather's first semester teaching (fall '03); she's pretty timid, which was unfortunate when we did class critiques, which weren't very useful since most of the class refused to comment on anything. If you need someone who will hold your hand and tell you what to do to improve, find someone else. Nevertheless, for sheer time spent in the class (5 hours a week) and on homework, I made great progress. 
Being a great artist when you begin is NOT necessary-- the class didn't teach me anything I didn't do in Drawing 2 in high school. It's pretty basic material: line, texture, light, form, perspective, still-life, charcoal, pencil, ink. Bonus: nude models!

I really like Professor Barry.  I was in her section last year, and after a semester of CC, I appreciate her even more.  She facilitates class discussion, but she'll also lecture when she thinks it's necessary or appropriate.  And she WON'T call on you if you're not raising your hand, so don't worry.  Unlike what another reviewer said, she's often in a good mood, and her sweet and melodious voice is very soothing.  The workload for the class isn't bad at all.  There are 3 papers each semester, but 1 of the 3 in the first semester gets dropped.  The papers are graded toughly but fairly, and KB will basically tell you what to write (or at least give you a good idea) if you go to her office hours.  Also, Prof. Barry tells the class that she doesn't believe in writing in-class essays, so expect easy grading on the midterm and final.  One more thing: participation counts for 35%, but don't be scared; she uses that as a fudge factor to help your grade.  All in all, KB is nice, fair, and a great choice for Lit Hum.

I agree with the prior review: this class was an utter waste of time.  The performances themselves were highly worthwhile, but I doubt that the painfulness of the class made up for it; I had to consistently fight to stay awake.  Even students with fairly strong dance backgrounds who do not happen to be one of the professor's clear favorites are likely to find themselves feeling like they're listening in on someone else's private conversation.  If you want an ""in"" in the dance department, feel free to take this class, however for everyone else?   I recommend that you get the list of performances and go on your own.  Spare yourself the tedium or take it with another professor.

All right, there's a lot of Farooq bashing here. I admit, for a good majority of the class, I didn't like him, but in the end, I don't think he (or the class) was very bad at all. He is a VERY tough grader (I think the highest grade given to any one EVER was an A-, and you'll never achieve above that). But, in the end Farooq's not such a bad guy. I think he's a good teacher stuck in a very bad department. He'll have interesting debates with the students in class that are related (or not really) to what we're discussing class, and I think that's what made the class most enjoyable. Don't listen to how horribly awful the man is, because in the end, he's really not that bad at all.

Professor Russell is a brilliant, well-read woman who should have stuck to writing (she mentioned her recently completed book at least once a class).  Her lectures are full of useful and interesting information, a fact which you will discover weeks later while re-reading your notes in an attempt to figure out what the heck she was talking about in time for the midterm or final.  She often jumped between the planned topic, and something to do with the 1960s (her specialty) and she talked so quickly that I often had trouble writing down even her main points (a lap top is a useful tool in this class).  However, despite all the negative aspects of Professor Russell's teaching, I learned a whole lot.  If you are an urban studies major, or thinking about being an urban studies major, this class is a really great broad overview.  It's true that I had to work MUCH harder than I should have to learn as much as I did, and I would definitely recommend taking the class with another professor if it's ever offered.  Until then though, if you are willing to work hard (and deal with a mediocre professor) this class might just be worth while.

If you get Shannan for CC you've obviously managed to please Eileen Gilooly in some way. Simply put, he's a nearly-perfect CC instructor. A grad student in the History Dept., Shannan always made CC surprisingly interesting. He didn't pontificate, but I always felt that he explained the important concepts of each philosopher in class *and* allowed for a lot of discussion, which is pretty hard. He let us out slightly early, since we didn't get a break in the middle like most classes (which I actually preferred), and the individual reading assignments were rarely overwhelming (and when they were, like 300 pages of City of God for a Wed., he reduced them). Midterm and final weren't terribly hard, though since it's CC you do need to prepare. He did let us help determine the format of the final. We had four papers of 1500 words each, which is a lot but the fourth ended up being optional. Grading on the papers seemed to be fair, slightly leaning towards generous. The only problem I had was that we started writing our papers nearly a month in, so by the end of the semester it seemed as though we were always writing something for CC. Other than that, an ideal way to get  through the most difficult Core requirement.

Professor Falcon-Paradi was AMAZING. Although the class was horribly situated (M/T/R 7:40-8:55!!!!) I was never bored in class. He works hard to get to know his students, and always makes jokes.

I partially agree with the last review. All I have to say is that this guy is someone who will having you believe that he cares about your opinion of the class and that he's ""one of you"" (his ""Revolution"" bag only seems to secure that view), but in the end, he will listen in order to appease you, not out of genuine concern. It seems like that song from the 70's ""Backstabbers"" was made just for him. He won't admit to not knowing or not understanding a topic, which will leave you confused half the time... you'll probably end up writing a paper or two that's full of B.S. and at the last minute.

I think that all the negative reviews Prof. Valderrama has been getting have been very unfair - this class is definately not as painful as it has been made to sound. First of all, instead of complaining that the material is simply memorization, my friends and I were extremely grateful for a class like this in the middle of all our papers. Not only are the readings extremely light, but after the first midterm they become completely unneccesary. Yes, the memorization is considerable, but the concepts are about as easy as any class can get, and all that needs to be done on either of the two midterms is regurgitation of facts.
Prof. Valderrama isn't the best lecturer, but you only have to go to take the quizzes, (her lectures are online) which are, again, completely memorization and extremely easy. The material, as with any intro course, isn't going to be the most fascinating, but when we got into talking about subjects that actually applied to her work she was very knowledgable and excited. I don't think there is a prof out there that could make taxonomy interesting. 
If you hate science, this is the easiest way to fulfill your requirement, and the most painless if it is done correctly. I especially recommend this class if you have ANY biology background at all, because it is a summary of the most basic evolutionary concepts up to the first midterm, which will be simple. Don't go to lecture unless there is a quiz, and study for the upcoming quiz during the lectures you do attend. This way time spent studying is minimal. Don't expect the material to be interesting, but do expect to leave with a working knowldge of every single step along the evolutionary chain to modern humans - which is not so bad in itself. 
That being said, I really enjoyed this class simply because the material was so easy and the lectures basically optional.

There is a lot of memorization in this class, but that just makes the quizzes and midterms that much easier.  The lectures are well organized and presented on power point slides that are posted online after class.  So, you only need to go to class for the quizzes, which are very easy if you go over the notes once beforehand.  There are two midterms and a final, and Ximena drops the lowest grade of these not very difficult tests, which is definitely a plus.  Ximena basically reads her power point, but she manages to crack some jokes and get laughs.  Especially toward the end of the semester, when we got into more complex material, Ximena got more animated, funny, and interesting.  There is no better or easier class you  could take to fulfill the science requirment if you don't like science.  This course was an overall good experience.  If you have questions though, talk to the ta's because Ximena's not that good at answering them.

Professor Dabashi does incredible work for the world and the community except when it comes to his teaching. He arrived to class 10-15 minutes late each session and consistently let us out ten minutes late. We read one book per week and discussed the book for approximatey five minutes every class, though he chose to subject an unsuspecting student to giving a well-reasoned argument and synopsis of the book at the beginning of each class. His syllabus included several books which were out of print and many he chose to remove after we purchased them. If a student chose to disagree with his Marxist conception of the definition of colonialism ""the abuse of labor by capital"" (also known as capitalism) you would be ridiculed and ignored. He frequently had arguments with students about films and books not assigned for the course (Kant, Adorno & Horkheimer, the film ""the battle of algiers""). His classes follow no structure whatsoever and he makes leaps in the conversation by telling stories which are only mildly relevant to the topic of discussion. Sometimes it is difficult to be sure what he is actually talking about. He also made us come to a film screening and discussion for two hours every wednesday night, doubling the amount of classtime. During one such meeting, a student made an unbearably misogynist comment which amounted to ""one can tell that a woman has been raped if there is some indication of sexual pleasure."" A young woman in the class was offended and said so, asking the young man to refrain from such doltish and offensive commenting.The ever-so-progressive Dabashi screamed at her for asserting her right not to listen to that sort of offensive and violent language in the classroom. The professor was extremely condescending to her. This sort of behavior is indicative of the general Dabashi way, which appears progressive and yet is so completely egoistic and control-bound that you won't learn a thing by questioning. Famous Professors often suffer from these groupie diseases, it becomes a disservice to their work and their students. The grades reflect only the degree to which you agree with everything he says and grovel at the Dabashi altar.

First off, I took Data Structures with the guy too.  Everyone who wrote a bad review of this guy is rather stupid.  Swing interfaces are key parts of every assignment involving Java after Data Structures.  Furthermore, copying code to create the data structures is fine - it's a matter of using them - why do you think the class is considered a difficult one for many?  Because they don't know how to copy properly?
But I digress.  Robotics is Allen's specialty, and he clearly shows he knows what he's talking about.  The class has some rather cool aspects about it, including the use of a robot simulator.  You actually apply concepts from linear algebra to something.  Furthermore, it gives a solid background to what kinds of projects are going on in robotics.  Some of it is basic at first, but it gets better as it progresses.

For the three midterm exams, he takes almost all (like 20-23 out of 25) questions from the practice exams to lull you into a false sense of complacency. This, combined with thte fact that he lectures on a PhD level but gives the first three midterms on a high school level really skews your perception of the course, how to understand his lectures, and how to study for exams.

Professor Klein is absolutely fantastic. I love him.. 
my class seems to love him... and overall, he makes art humanities an extremely enjoyable experience.  I came into the class with little to no knowledge of art and left with not only a great handle on the basics of momumental art and art movements through history, but a love for the subject and a desire to learn more. He makes art fun. Take his class... don't switch out if you get his section!!!

every session was a 2 hour lecture. it didnt really matter if you showed up, i think he didnt really notice or care. BUT, the guy is absolutely brilliant and undergrads have no real chance of understanding how deep his knowledge of marx and tocqueville is without already having extensively studied both. id say your best for learning is to take his option of a tocq-marx combination fall/spring seminar series.

A mediocre professor, nothing special, nothing horrendous. The one problem is that he's usually a bit sloppy with the equations he puts on the board, so take a little more care when you're taking notes. Also, the practice exams were a bit less effective for having a couple of wrong formulae and errors in the solution set.

As you can read on CULPA and the SEAS Oracle, students who have taken this course generally have lots of positive things to say about it, most of which are absolutely true.
However, because the course places such a huge emphasis on collaboration and the interchange of ideas,  what you get out of it varies greatly with the competence and creativity of your fellow classmates.  For some reason, Prof. Ross seems convinced that the course ""self-selects"" smart people, that those enrolled in it are naturally highly critical/creative thinkers.  This may have been true for past offerings of this course, but I did not find it to be the case when I took it.
Out of 22 students, maybe 8 regularly produced creative, original ideas and could competently implement them.  Most of the others were pretty average, while a few people were just plain dumb, lazy, or both.  This may sound harsh, but when you find yourself teamed up with one or (gasp) two of these people and have to think through an inventive problem solution, code it, and write the final report all by yourself, you *will* feel your urge to kill rising.  Also bear in mind that all members of a group receive the same grade, and there is no formal peer review process.
I still recommend this course; it has several important merits that others have mentioned, and what you learn in it will stay relevant long after you forget the intricate details of distributed transactions or lambda calculus.  If you put in the work, you will walk away content unless, like me, you don't suffer fools gladly.  If you don't put in the work, you will still do relatively well at the expense of those who do.

Professor Sohrabi is far better than the previous review would have you believe. I will admit that the beginning of the year was a little rough; the Ancient Greeks may not be his forte. However, he has become increasingly engaging and stimulating as the year has progressed. While his early lectures were sometimes repetitive and lengthy, that was probably the result of insecurity rather than any other vice or deficiency. The undergraduate specimens are just as much, if not more, to blame for any problems. Professor Sohrabi definately knows what he is talking about, and many class discussions have been excellent. Generally, he is good at balancing lecture and discussion, and he excells at condensing large themes and broad comparisons. He also seems to be a very, very nice guy. Now, only his rather simplistic essay questions need amending.

Braverman was all in all... not bad.  Not an intensely dynamic lecture but certainly well-informed about the subject.  He often has the air of being very stressed out and usually lets class out five minutes early.

I took this class not particularly interested in plants, but wanting to avoid taking Animal Phys for my major requirement. What a great class! Shepard is the newest member of the faculty and obviously wants to make sure everyone is comfortable with the material. 
All lectures are Powerpoint, but she prints them out ahead of time and gives them out in class. The handouts are helpful but don't replace the textbook -- you'll need to study both for exams.

Hands down the best class I have taken at Columbia (I'm a senior).  Professor Peters is brilliant, kind, thoughtful, funny...The reading is very carefully selected, extremely interesting, and put together so that the readings for each week speak to one another in unpredictable ways.  Professor Peters is always prepared for class, and keeps the seminar moving.  The discussion is always interesting, and she is intellectually fearless, always willing to ask us questions regardless of their implications.  She is also infinitely available by phone, e-mail and in her office, and is interested in her students and eager to help them.  She is genuinely interested in the course material, and genuinely interested in what her students have to say.  If you ever have the opportunity to take a seminar with her, you shouldn't think twice about it.
Workload:
Reading every week, and some movie-watching.  One terrific thing about the syllabus is that Professor Peters is very careful to assign only the parts of a reading that are genuinely necessary, so the amount of reading is always completely doable.

I had Jaleh last spring, and I don't know who wandered into her class this year, but they've got everything ALL WRONG. Jaleh is superb. She wants you to understand the works inductively. Her Socratic method is the best way to come to raise important questions about the works because if people's points don't hold up, then the class cannot stack a discussion on top of them. She forces you to abondon preconceived notions and easy answers. While there may be the occasional lapse into ""bulls****"", this is not Jaleh's fault. People should not speak if they know they aren't making sense. Yes, there's a little jargon, but new-fangled verbs are in every humanities class at Columbia. In Jaleh's case, they don't detract from her points. She is extremely encouraging, and anyone who doesn't realize how perceptive she is or how much she cares about the material should trying staying awake when the lights go off.  Also ""synecdoche"" is a Greek word, and as is the case with many, everyone pronounces them differently. That is not indicative of her intelligence or ability to make the course great.

I completely agree with the other reviewer. 
Prof. Sanchez has tons of real-life experience; he is very active in local government in jackson heights, which is ""ground zero"" for immigration, and is himself the child of Colombian immigrants (a fact he doesn't let you forget). His lectures are completely disorganized (he once repreated almost the same lecture two classes in a row), and while he himself is knowlegable regarding the subject matter, he has a difficult time conveying anything beyond buzzwords such as ""transnationalism"" and ""globalization."" We got through only a portion of the syllabus and it was never really clear which readings were expected for which class. However, by doing the extremely lengthy and mostly soporific readings (a must in order to write the midterm and final exams), a came away with a greater understanding of the topic and what the professor had been trying to convey. Sanchez is personable and often humorous, but unfortunately, these traits do not make him an effective teacher. This class is not without merit, but I don't think I'd take it again knowing the amount of work it entails.

if you have to take this course, don't worry.  it's easy and sometimes really interesting.  although prof wald's one hour lectures before the guest speaker can be EXCRUICIATINGLY boring, many of the guest speakers are really good.  of course, some aren't, and then those are when most of the class takes naps in the dimmed down lighting...  the most important thing to know about this class: if you are too slackerish to go to lecture (although you really ought to go) you MUST at least go to a recitation section.

yes, prof katz is a nice guy and his tests are much easier than cornish's.  however, he answers every single question from the class, and many of these end up being irrelevant.  thus, you get up at 9am to learn very little in class and are expected to teach yourself from the book.  Another annoying thing that prof katz often does is not teach what he expects you to be able to do on the problem sets.

This was a very frustrating class.  Professor Genter has an old-school quality to her that makes you not want to ask questions.  She does a pretty good job at making you feel stupid if you DO ask one and she doesn't like it, or if you give a wrong answer.  If you give one wrong answer, she assumes you haven't done any of the reading and gets pissed.  Her requirements are beyond unclear.  Her study guide for the final looked like a copy of the syllabus--no help there.  The lectures are really only helpful when we do mat work, otherwise, they are equally unorganized and you are better off just memorizing the book (which is what she wants you to do).  Sometimes, she is very nice and very interested in her students and will even laugh and smile at you and be supportive.  Otherwise, this class was extremely aggrivating.  I'd say at least a third of the class failed or came close to failing the mid-term, as well, because she is unable to specify what she really wants you to study and learn.  I did learn a lot in this course, but that came mostly from the just doing the reading.

There are SSSOOOO many good things I can say about Professor Somasundaran.  First, he is one of the most entertaining professors that I have ever had.  He would make the corniest jokes and make the silliest comments.  I am not a morning person, but he makes me excited about going to his lectures.
Second, he is a very good lecturer.  Surface Chemistry isn't something easy to learn, but Professor makes analogies to his topics so that the class can understand what he's saying.  We only used his course packet (written by him) as our only text, and I learned a lot from it!
Last but certain not least, he is also very caring towards his students.  He puts his students first before his other work.  I emailed him once asking to meet him for office hours around 2 PM, and he didn't get back to me until 11 PM.  He felt so bad that he gave me his number to call him if I needed help.

Getting a good CC  teacher is like gambling with the devl -- you're probably going to get screwed over. But you're pretty lucky if you get Professor Sohrabi. The last review was unbelievably inaccurate. The class was rough in the beginning of the year because Sohrabi is definately not an expert on Ancient Greeks, or anything too pre-modern. However, the detrimental contributions and inane comments from the class itself did not help. Professor Sohrabi is really good at summarizing and condensing big themes and sweeping comparisons. He balances discussion and lecturing well; again, his lectures were only boring at the very beginning. Most of the time, he makes really interesting points, and he keeps getting better as the course goes on. His grading is pretty fair (although, I must admit, his essay questions leave a LOT to be desired). But overall, the man certainly knows what he is talking about, and he clearly gets excited when his students contribute meaningul comments to discussion. He is exceptionally good at listening to comments and questions and really trying to understand what the student is saying. Basically, as long as you're not too in love with anyone B.C., you're pretty lucky to have Sohrabi. I'm definately looking forward to another semester with him.

KB is amazing. Her lectures are thought provoking and well organized. She is very good at leading discussions (however, if your section is full of dullards, it may be slow going at times). Her essay questions were stimulating and allowed for a lot of creativity and independent thought, without being too vague. She is a little more on the formal side, but she's definately got a sense of humor. She wants to class to realize things on their own, but if you're really not getting it, she jumps in with her wisdom. Sometimes, she will leave issues unresolved if you can't figure them out yourself. Some people were frustrated by this, but that's how you LEARN, people. Grading is tough but fair on papers but merciful on exams. Most importantly, the woman is BRILLIANT. I got so much out of my Lit Hum experience thanks to her; she is truly an educator.

DiGiorgio's Money and Banking has been a universally disappointing experience.  His lectures are disorganized and often irrelevent regarding material on the problem sets.  He simply throws a number of pointless overheads on the projector, says a word or two of little cosequence, and moves on to the next random slide.  Rarely was an actual model presented -- even less likely was an explanation of that model.  
Giorgio missed the 1st class and had a much better lecturer cover for 2 others, effectively only attending 80% of his classes.  
Class objectives were never clearly defined.  The textbook was essential for anyone hoping to learn anything.  
The class has been a study in disorganization.  It is apparent that the TA's and Giorgio never speak.  A good portion of the beginning of each class (there wer only 15 mind you) was spent trying to get co-ordinated, or so it would seem.

Although Professor Adams could win us over with her cuteness, she was largely unhelpful as a writing instructor. Classes consist of a few attempts to get students interested in the work of famous authors, some unhelpful diagrams on the board, and then workshopping up to four works each time. It turns out that there are too many assignments to allow for effective revision, not to mention the fact that her comments on your work are more analysis of its deeper meanings than critical suggestions. She expects people to read other people's work (I repeat, four stories each class) AND also read the copies of stories and other nonsense she passes out each time. Fortunately, she's too wishy-washy to follow up on most of this stuff. She's extremely sweet-tempered and she put up with the snide comments our class was continually making, but her teaching skills are fluffy at best. One good thing was that she seemed to get really involved in every story, resulting in her remembering everything that anyone ever wrote. Which, actually, might not be such a good thing after all.

He also tries to make all the material as hard as possible, even in the easiest topics.  Yang  constantly introduces the most minute and unnecessary details that only obstruct the concepts.
Moreover, on his tests, he asks the most minute and unnecessary details.  For example, he would ask you about the Angtrom width of the channel in the lower middle part.  Or to recite an amino acid that was a part of some protein that functioned in one of the pathways that was described in 12-page research paper.  (And those questions, of course, would be worth about 10 points).
Yang does not know how to communicate with his students either.    I hated this class, although I must admit that the material we learned was very interesting.

This class just isn't great. While it's admittedly difficult to cram 500 years of Chinese history into one semester, the class should have run more smoothly than it did. Her lecturing style (even her pronounciation) was condescending, even for a columbia prof. The paper assignments, midterms and finals were confusingly vague, yet still graded rather harshly. I am an ealac major, and this class frustrated and bored me more than any other. To be fair, it got better as the term went along. 
However, its just not worth it. There's a lot more out there, don't waste your time.

The reviews here have gotten a little sketchy, I'm not quite sure what's up, but here's what I think. Towards the beginning of the class I was very excited: Stacey somehow managed to keep us involved despite the great number of people attending, he related things back to current events, and he seemed to have a great understanding of the material.
However, by the middle of the semester, it had become clear that Stacey wasn't the perfect teacher. His lectures often got boring. They sometimes seemed like summaries of one of the articles from the course readings. He would ramble off topic for up to 10 minutes. Although he could usually answer the hard questions, he often couldn't explain simple topics sufficiently. (On the other hand, in most classes of that size, I doubt the professor would allow the kids to ask so many questions. Still, when he didn't know the answer, he would ramble about something else, leaving us all confused).
I have no idea why everyone was so delighted with the policy simulations. The JFK one was interesting, but I'm going to have to take some of the comments people left on it as a joke.  While it showed that one day in the future he could be an excellent teacher, it wasn't 75 minutes of pure bliss.
The lessons in the final part of the semester were excellent. If google is right, the subjects he covered (globalization/North-South relations/EU) were his areas of study. I found that many of the others in class were way too quick to say he was rambling (although I insist that he was doing so, often, earlier in the semester) when in reality he was speaking quite clearly on a subject.
He provides very little incentive to do the readings for class or to even attend. Everything was take-home -- tests and papers -- so you could just read up based on the question at hand.  I didn't do most of the reading on time but was still able to succeed on those papers, although it was a bit hectic. My TA was excellent and helped explain when Stacey couldn't (or maybe, didn't).
I think the grading depended a bit on your TA. Everyone I talked to received between a C+ and an A-. I didn't hear of anyone doing better or worse than that. B+ was very common.

Vila is an incredibly caring professor. I was amazed by his desire to help us not only learn Spanish but also succeed at Columbia.  He was always responsive to questions in class, and was the first to admit when there was no clear answer to a question. I think he was a good explainer; Vila just didn't make things clear cut when they weren't, and language often isn't clear cut.  There were students of varying ability in the class and Vila was able to take care of all of us. He created an environment where you could feel comfortable asking even the simplest question.
If you enjoy Spanish you'll probably enjoy his teaching style. It's easy to make a grammar lesson boring, but Vila knows how to keep the students entertained. There were a few times when I did feel like things were getting repetitive, but in general I looked forward to the class.
I'm not going to pretend that the class was challenging -- it wasn't.  The Spanish was mostly review for me, and the tests were pretty straightforward. If you want a teacher that forces you to learn, do not take this class if it's taught by Vila. On the other hand, if you can keep yourself motivated, you'll find his style rewarding. Once a week, you hand in a 1 page paper on literally anything, he hands it back to you with corrections, you make your corrections, and then he hands that back with more corrections. Sounds complicated, but it's a good way to improve grammar, and since he doesn't grade the stuff, it's totally no pressure.
I should make it clear that I felt the class moved too slowly, and I definitely was challenged more in my Spanish classes in high school. At the same time, I didn't enjoy them as much as this one, and I do believe that I've gotten a better feeling for the Spanish language from it.

I can't believe there aren't more raving reviews about Professor Suarez! This guy is amazing, beyond amazing...despite my hesitance about taking Spanish for my language requirement since I got sick of in high school, Jesus has revitalized my love for the language. Jesus is very knowledgeable not only of the language but also of the culture. He's incredibly helpful in class and remarkably does not get annoyed when the class asks questions. In fact he is totally cool when we ask him to repeat something or to say it slower. I learned so much from this class at the same time I enjoyed this class more than any other. It was a small size, so we were able to get to know one another. Jesus is personable inside and outside of class. He is actually really interested in us as people, other than as just students. He has a great sense of humor which of course adds to the fun of the class. The material wasn't too hard but I really have to credit that to the professor and of course my fellow hard working classmates. There's a lot of grammar to review and it was required to watch a cheesy soap opera, but all in all I learned a lot. Jesus made it very comfortable for us to speak Spanish in class because he never scolded us for wrong pronunciation rather he helped us out and we were always allowed to tell ancedotes in Spanish and whenever we didn't know how to say a word Jesus helped us. The more speaking in class, the more we were able to comprehend the language. I highly recommend this class. I can not imagine taking this course with anyone else.

Not bad, not bad at all. There are excercises to do in a workbook (which you should do-because he will collect it on test days), 3 quizzes, 3 tests and a final.

Homework varies each night, he doesn't check it or anything but it's best to come to class prepared so you can contribute to class discussions...makes it all the more interesting. The tests will be no problem if you study your grammar and do the readings. Once again an AWESOME CLASS.

I must agree with the last reviewer. I still cannot believe how much of a following Mendelson has in this school. His moralistic lectures often put you to sleep at nine in the morning; his reading of the books is shallow enough to make you believe you're back to a high school setting. If you love literature and are serious about analyzing it, please save yourself time and mind and steer away from Mendelson. I should have dropped the class the moment he started analyzing Hardy's Tess D'urbervilles in the following way: Was it Tess's destiny that drove her to ...? Or was it really Tess herself that ...? His lectures mostly consists on superfluous anecdotes, moralizing and paraphrasing novels and poems.

Goodhart is a good lecturer and clearly in command of the material, but this course is in entirely the wrong department.  For Poli Sci students, especially comparative poli sci students, looking for some insight into the broad theoretical questions raised by the EU, this is not the class.  The entire course is spent rehearsing the history of the EU and grinding through the minutiae of its procedures - important information, no doubt, but of little interest to political science students.  The course is taught as though it is an orientation session for bureaucrats desiring to learn the nuts and bolts of the system.  At the beginning of the class, Goodhart pointed out that the EU is fascinating as a comparative study to the US and as a challenge to the nation-state.  I couldn't agree more; these questions are exactly why I registered for the class.  I only wish we had addressed them.

I disagree with the other reviewers who found Prof. Evans boring.  Maybe if you've already had a decent amount of physics or are taking this class just because it fulfills the science requirement this would be the case.  I, having very limited knowledge of physics going in, got exactly what I wanted - a good overview of several major areas of physics w/o too much math involved.  
While he's not the best lecturer I've had, he's certainly good.  The material is interesting and well chosen.  Prof. Evans organizes it well and presents it with enthusiasm.  Sometimes he jumps quickly through equations that seemed complicated to me, but this usually just means they won't be on the exam.
While it's not the easiest science requirement sequence, the work isn't bad and the knowledge gained is well worth taking the class.  You do need to go to lectures though - just doing the readings probably won't get you through the tests.

Also, he explained in class that he had consciously chosen to retain his accent when he came to the US to keep the ""educated foreigner"" persona rather than just sounding like he talked strangely.

Professor Gozzi's vagueness (perhaps characteristically Italian) can be a bit annoying: she's not always clear about what particular assignments are, when things are do, and so forth.

The class on the whole is rather loosely structured, which makes it relatively low-stress, but perhaps not the most intensive way to learn a language.

I'm not sure what all the fuss about Prof. Shaprio is for; sure, his class is enjoyable, but his lectures tend to be pretty lightweight, as he seems more concerned with making grandiose statements about what he intends to do (""I'm using each lecture to show you a different way to read these plays..I want to strip away all the stuff that you've learned and really have you read this stuff, etc) than really doing it.  His approach emphasizes discussion, and while this may minimize unnecessary note-taking and boring lectures, it isn't always particularly educational.

Prof. Abdulkadiroglu (I dare you to pronounce it) is a great man. After my macro class, he made micro a breeze. Everything on his tests comes from his lectures (make sure to circle anything he suggests ""could"" be on the next exam -- and to be at the lectures) and he's really not out to get you. Thats not to say I did so fabulously on all his tests: while I aced his first midterm, the second for me was a miserable failure. Honestly, though, I deserved it. Looking at my notes afterwards, and then going to speak to him -- and seeing how concerned he was with my drop in grades, I can honestly say that I should have done better. I think the biggest problem you can have in this class is to feel too relaxed about it. At least thats how I felt - the problem sets were optional and not graded (and I never did them), and Atila has a way to make micro just seem ridiculously easy.

 Firstly, those that label his lectures (style) as simply moralistic and inept are [WRONG]. *CULPA censor* Sure Professor Mendelson doesn't give a damn about reading 10 pages of notes; and more interested in the real significance of the works and poetry so as to keep most of the class (nearly 100 students) riveted for an hour and fifteen minutes. That is an accomplishment for any class.
 I think that those that call his class a ""cult""  and believe that it is an insult to label it as ""moralistic"" were angry that he didn't tell us to kill ourselves or come to the conclusion that the world has no relevance but for those that understand fully the didactic and aesthetic constructs of Joyce's work.

I disagree.  Drugs and Behavior was easily my favorite class.  Although it could get annoying when he allowed questions - c'mon, its a 100+ lecture class and at 9:30 in the morning NO ONE asks reasonable questions - he presented the lectures in a well-articulated lesson.  Yes, he basically reads off his powerpoint, but I thought it was helpful in taking notes - and he does allow enough time to jot down everything from a given slide.  Pop quizzes personally kept me on track, and I think that its a positive reinforcement for you to go to class.

Great class for getting an introduction to Japanese history. The lectures were a bit boring as all he did was stand there and talk but he's very enthusiastic about the subject and just a plain nice guy.

Admittedly there are more interesting CC instructors than Mark Couch.  With that said, he isn't the worst one out there either.  If you are one of those students taking CC just to finish the Core requirements for the College or SEAS, he's probably the ideal.  Yeah, he's boring and tends to drone on in a monotonous tone when he's speaking but at least you know where he's leading the discussion to (more or less) because he writes down three discussion questions he wants to cover at the beginning of each class.  He gives a bit of ""background"" info on whatever the text of the day and then opens the table for discussion.  The discussion more or less are centred around these said questions and if he feels students are missing the point, he jumps in and redirects the discussion.  So if you want to be gung-ho and join in the discussion, it definitely helps to have read the texts before coming to class.  Or sometimes it's possible to just glide along with the flow and jump in if you feel you have something ""positive"" to say.  If you take sufficient notes that give you his answers to the questions he writes to the board, then you should be fine when you write the essays because they are tailored such that you basically reiterate what was covered in class and to give your opinion.  The midterm and the final are formatted in the same principle...just go over your notes and perhaps skim the texts if you haven't already.  And yeah, he doesn't seem to count your absences unless you are conspicuously absent all the time.  In-class participation is OPTIONAL, in fact, it's common to see students nod off during class for mini-naps.

  Professor Vogt is simply amazing. Before her class, I had always thought that the history of philosophy was worthless. Honestly, I still do. Yet still her lectures will simply thrilling. I hung on every word of her eloquent soliloquies as I would hang on to every word of a brilliant novel. For some reason, and I'm not sure exactly why, I always wanted to hear every detail and anecdote she offerred.
    The one shortcoming of the class is that she seemed to take as many questions as we could throw at her and would never cut a student off regardless of how inconsequentlal or lengthy his tirade was. Some might think this a good thing; however, pausing in her lecture to hear students babble is like pausing the Nightly News Hour  to watch the O'Reilly factor: always jarring and often unpleasant.

   The manner in which Zhang laoshi runs her class makes you feel a bit guilty about the way you approach school. Her transparent emphasis on learning in lieu of serious concern for grades was astounding. Couple examples: during dictations, you could ask her for hints; before a test, she told you 'everything' you need to review; and best of all, she didn't grade homework!
   Those of you who think you ought learn with Zhang laoshi for these reasons are in for the internal guilt that I experienced. When in a class with her, she offers you knowledge in such a way that you somehow convince yourself that we take classes to learn, not to earn marks.

This class is a disaster.  I'm surprised more people haven't written to complain about it.  All these reviews will tell you Helfand is a funny, nice guy who genuinely seems to care what his students think - which is true.  But it's not like you're going to enjoy the class material, or the ridiculously difficult (for no apparent reason) problem sets.  Classes are disorganized and there seems to be no sense that we are going anywhere in this course.  One week it's analyzing roof tiles from Hiroshima, the next it's determining the diet of skeletons.  This sounds fun and interesting, but wait until you have to take notes and do problems on it - this is where Helfand ruins it.  No textbook, so no way of getting the information except from lectures.  Not that by going to lectures you would have any idea how to do the problem sets anyway.  Better set your watch to go off when he has office hours every week, just so you can get a passing grade on the problem sets.  Anyway, a lot of us are stuck in it for the next semester since it's part of a sequence.  Trust me, if you have the choice, take another sequence.  This is NOT an easy way to do the science requirement.

Assuming, you grew up in a household where Russian was spoken, the class will markedly improve your writing and linguistic abilities. You should not come to class and expect to get away without doing homework. She engages you and will make you speak (related to your homework) nearly every class. If she sees you drifting off, she will draw you back into the discussion. The material is not particularly interesting, but her stern and direct lecture style will keep you engaged. Some might not think she seems very kind, but that is simply because she keeps her classes structured and well organized. Since the class combines two years of Russian into one, she moves it relatively quickly. Though you probably will not leave a class entertained, you will leave with a plethora of information. Her grading is fair, if not somewhat generous. She will also have you correct every homework assignment, quiz, and test. This not only slightly boosts your grades, but also allows you to learn the material more effectively. Possibly the most important point: She is very willing to meet with students on a one-on-one basis, even outside of her office hours. In fact, if she sees you are having trouble she will require you to meet with her, and will strongly encourage meeting with her often. 

Workload:
Mostly moderate, but it can vary. Homework is usually assigned for each class, which will take you anywhere from 20 minutes to two hours (depending on your previous knowledge of Russian). The homework varies from reading assignments, to writing responses, to language and grammar exercises. ThereÂ’s a pop quiz or two in the first half of the first semester to keep you on your toes, but they are not difficult. There are two major tests (take up the entire class), which are not hard but require learning/memorizing A LOT of grammar rules if you were previously unfamiliar with them. No midterm. She gives a comprehensive final (same style as the tests) that takes up an entire class period along with a take home essay.

Though very interesting, the experimental freshman class was riddled with problems: poorly written problem sets that often were not based off of the lectures, an attempt to cover too much information too quickly, and often a lack of connection among the topics. But the course will probably vastly improve since it was a pilot course, so now onto Don Hood:
In this seminar class of about 15 students, the class would usually start out with him summarizing the previous general lecture and would often be interspersed with student questions (and some discussion). His lecture style falls somewhere in between chirpy / engaging and dry / unenthusiastic. The problem is that much of the material was not his own specialty and he might even be learning it for the first time. But the lectures on his area of expertise (which is presumably relevant to his other classes) had an interesting subject matter and he would often become more engaging or excited about the material. He was organized enough that he was easy to follow in his lecture. He would present facts rather simply while providing a good foundation for when he would talk about bigger ideas and concepts. I rarely left feeling I did not understand some subject material Â– and if so he invites and always answers questions. He is also very approachable after class and will easily talk to you (at which point you also realize he is rather lighthearted and even slightly amusing). I donÂ’t know how good he is about being open during his office hours, but he is probably the best professor I have seen in regards to promptly responding to student e-mails (during the daytime). Grading was based only on hideous problem sets, but compared to the other professors teaching the class I understand he fell somewhere in between. So his grading is definitely fair (if not charitable). 

Workload:

Flaherty seems like a nice guy, and I'm sure he does an excellent job teaching the higher level courses ('cause he really does know the material) but I mean please people, Principles should not be taught this way.  Flaherty took a whole (boring) class period to explain why the demand curve slopes downward, but then glossed over important issues like monetary policy.

Columbia has the potential to have one of the finest choirs of any school in the country.  We're in New York!  There should be plenty of singers to choose from.  Sadly, we don't, primarily because the choir is not ballanced.  There is no effort to recruit male voices.  Most guys don't even know we exist because the choir does not  get very much publicity or exposure.  Furthermore,  with all those GS students on campus who've sung professionally (i.e. Broadway), we could be fantastic.  But no one tries to reach out to them, and get them to join. Gail is a gifted musician who is very caring about music.  However,  she is not practicle in terms of recruiting talanted voices.  Christ, NYU has a better choir than Columbia.

Like Prof. Mendelson, I hate pretentiousness and English major-jargon. Yes, those students deserve to be shut up in class and Prof. Mendelson does a good job of it. Pen-clickers. Students whose laughter at his jokes goes beyond a ""slight chuckle."" Ok, a little extreme but if he wants to shut them up too, fine. Quirkiness, not a problem. An endless supply of stories about his twelve-year-old son and the former student who supposedly said ""What does this have to do with me? I'm from Scarsdale!"", not a problem either. Sometimes even worth that slight chuckle. The problem is the broad, sweeping generalities. Now, if this is the way you like to interpret literature, by all means, take this class and you'll enjoy it. In fact, I highly recommend it. But if not, I'll give you a brief synopsis right here. Tess: is she an individual or a category? the product of outside forces or responsible for her own actions? raped or not? surprise surprise ALL OF THE ABOVE. Wilde: It's all about style. Conrad: Meaninglessness. Yeats: ideals, artificiality, myth, hint: he's winking at you. Joyce: conquering language. And Stephen's pretentious, so watch out. Eliot: we're isolated. the world is incoherent. Woolf: so Clarissa was originally supposed to die at the end. Auden: did you know that Mendelson is the proprietor of his estate? that's what I personally found to be the most interesting part of the Auden lectures. Ok, so you get the broad themes of modernism. I would have liked a little more.  And remember, don't slouch. 
Workload:
Light reading, 2 short papers, a final. That's all well and good. BUT who grades your papers? That's a mystery. Prof. Mendelson talks about staying up to finish grading them.

If he has so little respect for them, maybe they shouldn't be grading the papers. Especially not with such insighful comments as ""the plural of Tess is Tess' not Tess's.

In my opinion, Dr. Gibber is an odd lady.  She always sounds like she has a cold and lectures rather quickly.  She is quite disorganized.  Visit her office sometime and see what a mess it is--papers everywhere.  She only taught a section of Bio using her famous Powerpoint slides.  My advice to the Pre-Meds who are in Bio with Gibber is to go over the slides and to USE THE BOOK to uncover the tiny details portrayed in a vague manner on her slides--as these details will be on the Test.  She is big on application questions and a student must get use to her method of testing--if you know the answer, be as specific as possible in your response.  If you dont know it, then spit out some vague memorized phrase telling the reason for your answer and youll get some partial credit.  Take Physiology if you want a great prep for the MCAT and are willing to deal with the frequent cramming for the 5 mini-exams.

One of the most philosphical, analytical and interesting courses I have taken at Columbia.  Prof Nichanian is an excelent lecturer who can get away with formulating ideas seemingly on the fly without neglecting to cover the required material.  I can understand the negativity of some other reviews -- the course description is somewhat inaccuratate and dilutes the acutal focus.   However, the assertation that the goals are forgotten is incorrect -- Prof Nichanian clearly defines the course as dealing with the questions concerning the fututre of anthropology that have arrisen following the publication of Said's Orientalism, and this is covered from the first dayto the last.   Said, an excellent writer whose philosophical depth is often overshadowed by his political controversiality, is treated objectively as a thinker.  His idea are discussed in relation to fields as diverse as theories of anthropology and the philosophical concept of discourse.  Authors as seemingly disparate as Foucalt, Freud and Levi-Strause are in the sylabus, and Prof Nichanian does an excellent job of relating their ideas.  At times, the professor will spend extra lectures on works he finds particularly interesting at the expense of other ones, but this gives the class an improvisational feel.  It follows that, while the class is structured as a lecture, student imput is greatly encouraged, and often comments made in the middle of class will shape discussion for the remainer of the 75 minutes and even the lectures in coming weeks.  The professor can come off as unapproachable and aloof, but this reputation is definitely not deserved.  In fact, he is very open to indvidual discussion with students after class and during office hours (it is telling that he doesn't give specific hours of availability, since he will agree to meet at literary any time he is not schedualed to teach).  His charming Franco-Armenian accent can seem daunting at times, but he is aware of this, and sometimes will abruptly stop speaking, smile in acknowledgement that no one has understood what he was just trying to say, and rephrase himself.  I would recommend this class to anyone interested in philosophy or the study of foreign cultures.

The reading is heavy, but it is possible to cut corners while still being able to particpate.  There are no tests or quizes besides the final.  An ungraded one-page paper is due at each weekly recitation meeting, but the TA (Karman Rastegar) is leniant and will accept work late.  It is important to check in with the professor one on one from time to time after class, as each student is given a ""discreationary"" grade based, largely, on whether Nichanian can remember who you are.  Three papers are assigned over the semester, one to be delivered orally.   All paper topics are at students' chooseing, though the lecture must relate directly to one of the works read in class.  The lecture is ungraded and the first paper has a letter grade attached that doesn't factor into the final grade.  Papers are graded against a tough standard of originality, but the lowest grade ever given is a B.

Before both of the midterms and the final, students are given a list of topics discussed either in Mr. Hart's dazzling lectures (which are read verbatim from powerpoint slides: ""Corrective actions to deviant behavior are sometimes informal (joking, shunning, communicating displeasure) or formal (civil penalties, criminal justice system, treatment/rehab),"" abundant misspellings and grammatical errors ommitted) or from a text intent on speaking to you as though you're pals at a NORML rally.  While the questions included in these guides do admittedly inspire reflection (""Know the eight states that have laws protecting medical marijuana patients from arrest and jail, and understand how this is accomplished""), what I realized as I looked around at the other twenty six people sitting around me in the Butler lounge passionately reviewing the exact same answers to the exact same questions the night before the final was that my job was not to grasp the concepts I had learned over the course of the semester, never mind to think critically about drug issues, but to demonstrate that I could listen, nod, and know a few useless facts like the back of my hand.  As if to engineer some measure of justice into the equation, the five questions on the exam that were not going to be drawn from the study guide would be the ones that some of us would miss and others would get right, and it would be these that determined the difference between the mediocre and the great student in this class.
	I would like to give Professor Hart the benefit of the doubt in this matter, in that he is probably trying to make things easier for students by providing a study guide but drawing from it, but, alas, the truth is that studying for the exam is excruciatingly hard in that one must know every detail of EVERY ANSWER from the guide (a challenging task insofar as it competes with reading a technical manual for eight hours straight) and that one must hope to luck out on the few questions that we didn't see coming from a mile away.  I mean, essay topics were distributed in advance and entire essays (no more than a page in length, which might give you an idea of the maximal depth in thought allowed by the course) were memorized beforehand.  Did the professor or any of the T.A.'s ever stop to consider simply giving a test without -gasp!- a rattle and pacifier, or, better yet, requiring an investigative paper?  In truth, I don't think that Mr. Hart ever paused to think critically about this study guide situation or teaching actual concepts or even about his area of expertise, save to confirm academia's supremely irritating notions about drugs which were shoved down our throats every Tuesday and Thursday and during nightly readings: illicit drugs do not cause problems in modern society, our current drug laws are founded on every politician's conviction that every African-American male deserves to go to jail, and heroin users are wholly innocent victims of the trauma that is life.
	I might admit that my criticism is a little harsh, save for the fact that there seemed to be a substantial proportion of students sitting at every class (which we were required to attend thanks to coercive methods, i.e. quizzes) who actually ate up this philosophy without pausing to inspect it, but who, at the same time, were given no opportunity to demonstrate that they had ever had an original thought in their lives anyways.  The text is written for a teenager, the quantity of facts and absence of analysis is insulting, and the conclusions reached are absolutely inane.  ""Accurately defining the types of drug use that concern us facilitates precise communication and helps to ensure that appropriate interventions are implemented""?  No sh*t, Sherlock.  In short, if you came to this institution to conduct any form of insightful analysis or edifying scholarship, stay away, but if you're at Columbia to tell your friends that THC takes 5 to 8 seconds to reach the brain from the lungs as you pack your third bowl, you'll probably fit right in.

An all-around good teacher.  She comes prepared, teaches the concepts lucidly, and grades quite fairly.  One knows what to expect for the midterm and final and, while the material may seem like quite a bit of basic explication of argument, that is precisely what (I think) an introductory philosophy course should be all about.  If you need to wrap your head around the methodology of philosophy, this is a great way to start.  I can't say that the subject matter is very interesting, though.

In the first class he'll tell you how to pronounce his last name.  (It rhymes with 'king-kong' not 'gang.' ) Anyway, he does have an accent like most math teachers but it's not that bad and you'll get used to it quickly.  For example, he pronounces 'secant-squared-theta' as 'seekene-squayah-seta.'  He is a genius and is very nice.  He cut the webwork for our class in half because we complained to him that it was too hard.  He won't notice if you don't go to class but you have to go to get the homework problems in the textbook which he assigns at the end of class.  You can either call somebody or just show up for the last few minutes if you really don't wanna go.  Also, he often ends class as early as half an hour before the end of class.  He pretty much teaches with examples and finishes when he's done covering the material.  If you don't understand something, read the textbook.  I actually suggest reading the section that will be covered before class.  He is very open to questions.  One more thing, don't let him catch you leaving class in the middle.  There's not much he can do but he gets very offended and you will sit back down very embarrassed.  So if you come to class, plan to stay there till the end.

Yea, he's boring, welcome to chemistry.  He's a nice guy and is interested in chemistry he may go off on tangents but he's not bad.  He teaches via powerpoint presentations.  He doesn't know everybody by the end of the semester probably because he has so many students.  The first and third midterms are pretty easy but the second one is usually the hardest.  The final was easier than I expected.  A lot of questions from the midterms were repeated on the final so go over them.  Read the textbook to understand the concepts.  He asks a good amoun t of concept questions so make sure you understand what you're doing.  Overall, this class doesn't take that much work when there is no midterm that week.

Best 5 of 8 quizzes from the recitation count for 20% of your grade which usually helps your average.  Each of the 3 midterms is 19% and the final counts as 2 midterms for 38%.  Out of these 5 midterms (3+final) the lowest is dropped so if you do well on the midterms the final will only be worth 19%.  The reason they are 19 and not 20% is because he saves 4% for a chem-related report.  This doesn't count for so much and he gives extra credit for online evaluations which can balance it out.  Homework is posted online but totally optional.  I would only go over them before a midterm/final.

She is nice and friendly and has a system in which a student (called, the discussant) runs the class for the first hour, which everyone has to do at least once per semester, then a 10-minute cookie break with cookies provided by that day's discussant, then she leads the class for 40 minutes where she goes over administrative stuff like papers, midterms, and parties, and she gives us some of her favorite quotes and calls on the people who didn't speak for the first hour.  She grades the two papers based on content but she makes grammar corrections just to help you out.  She definitely loves the Core and the Iliad but doesn't really teach much which can be good because it forces the students to discuss it amongst themselves and come to their own conclusions.

All right, after reading the many positive and negative reviews about Susan, I'd like to give my own take.  I've had her the last 2 semester for Principles and Micro, and some of the stuff that people have said is downright inaccurate.  To characterize her behavior as ""ridiculously cartoonish,"" as the most recent reviewer has done, is absurd; hell, I don't even know what that means!  To call her arrogant is also unfair.  I would instead say that she's extremely confident in her teaching, which she should be: no one is in as much control of the class as Susan is.  What's more,  she is the clearest, savviest, most organized, and best lecturer that I've so far encountered in my time at Columbia.  She's also funny (in a slightly sarcastic way) and more than willing to answer students' questions--as stupid as some inevitably are.  Here's the catch: the problem set's are INCREDIBLY long and difficult.  My best advice to anyone taking her class is to work in a group (with smart people, if you can) and always attend recitation.  More about the problem sets: they are usually mathematically based, they DO often require obscure maneuvering, and the book will not help.  HOWEVER, both Susan (or Elmsy, as my friend and I like to call her...not to her face, of course) and the TAs are very willing to meet with you, and they post  solutions that are more detailed and helpful than anything you've ever seen (occassionally over 10 pages).  Study these solutions well!  One last note about the class: the 4 TAs are great.  Special props to Regina Almeyda Duran for being an incredible TA; if she's there again next semester, and you need help with the material, go to her.

Indeed, this semester has seen professor Sohrabi improve as  the readings moved away from the Greeks and religious texts and closer to ideas that he can talk about with a great fluency, and on which he can lead discussions quite well.  He is a very nice man, very pleasant and open to talk to about your ideas for papers, about the course or about the progress of the class in general.  I wish that he had been more consistently willing to take risks in his direction of our discussion, and try to push the class forward; whenever he did so it was a success.  Yet, there was a degree of intellectual lethargy present in the class that seemed to pose a serious obstacle for Professor Sohrabi.  Too often did he resort to repetition of the most basic points, seemingly unconvinced that the majority of the class had yet caught on, and was therefore unready to move forward.  All in all, though, it could have been much worse.  And, again, he's a really nice guy, and does really know his stuff.

This class is an unmitigated disaster. It is remarkable, actually, in that it is everything a history class shouldn't be.  We didn't EVER talk about why things happened, instead Carnes would stand up there and lecture like the little annoying professor that he is.  He would tell ""stories"" of history, that is, he would ""strip away everthing interesting, or nuanced, and give the class a crappy account of what happened.""  His tests are worse. They are half IDs and chronologies, on which there is no partial credit.  Thus, half of your grade, esentially, is knowing whether new york or hawaii legalized abortion first.  On top of that, the essays DEMAND that you do an ad-hoc analysis of history (what would have happened if nixon had won in '60.. how would american have been different.. remember that we have the asset of hindsight).  One other thing: he has this theory of the vietnam war that it was exclusively hubris that let america to get in and stay in.  That is, there was nothing domestic, nothing else international, and the presidents that made the decisions had no individual personalities.  It was the most pathetic attempt at teaching i have ever seen.  And people love him because he talks in a stupid voice, and is completely unintellectual.  This guy shouldn't be teaching at a community college, let alone Columbia University.

    What Carman lacks in philisophical precision he makes up for with entertainment value. Granted, possibly this subject material didn't allow for him to be rigorous in his argumentation and thorough in his analysis; regardless, during each class I got the feeling that we were at a level of such generality that anything held sway.
     Of course, when I got my first paper back, I realized that not just anything held sway. So a friend and I ran a little experiment (far from scientifically precise, so be forewarned). She went into his office hours and ""asked him about the paper topics."" I, on the other hand, wrote about the topic based on his lectures, the readings, and ultimately my philisophical reasoning.
    The result: Her = A. Me = B. Now, this result alone need not shock you, you know nothing about she or I. However, in light of reading the other reviews here, the conclusion becomes a bit more clear: shut up about your thoughts and remind him of his. (I use the word 'remind' since my friend related to me that when she went over her paper with him, he would review sections that were direct quotations from him and make such remarks as, ""Great idea!"").
      Point being: this Carman class was great because he's interesting on a general level and good grades are within your reach.

He babbles on about psychophysics this and psychophysics that so much you actually need another indtroductory course to figure out what he is saying. Yeah the quizzes are open book and open note and for some people open computer which I didn't think was fair when they pulled me aside and told me I was cheating. All in all, this class is awful. It may have been an easy A in the past but not anymore. This class royally sucks.

After reading the reviews on this class I figured it would be an easy way to knock off the science requirement. Boy was I wrong. This class ended up being one of the worst experiences of my life. The tests were open book but it didn't help much. I remeber finding the part of the book for the question and stil couldn't answer it right because of the way Galanter worded his questions and answers. There is no such thing as a huge curve either. Maybe in the past but not anymore. Galanter's lectures themselves are way to scientific for the typical undergrad to understand.

Most students did not read the books--which Schorsch seemed perfectly okay with. His standards were low, the class met them, and class was very painful.... Schorsch does not return assignments in a timely manner and cancelled class an exceptional number of times. His lectures were more historical than philosophical which was not particularly applicable in a class called ""Masterpieces of Western Philo.""

I really enjoyed Louise Rose' class, especially compared to some of the other horror stories you hear about some of the S&S profs. Both her class and Leslie Woodard's are usually the first to fill up, which shows you just how popular of an instructor she is. Prof. Rose is great with criticism - she always knows what works and what doesn't, even if you can't really articulate, and she has a good sense of humor. The workload wasn't really difficult and it's rarely tedious. Some people in the class felt that she pushed her own preferences towards writing at the expense of more experimental work, which is probably a valid criticism given that she focused heavily on realism and didn't have as much to stay about more unusual pieces. Also, it's nearly impossible to get an A in Structure and Style, and she keeps up that departmental policy. Other than that, I found Prof. Rose to be a great teacher for S&S and I highly recommend her class, which turned out to be my favorite of the semester.
Workload:
A few poems, short stories, and a one-act play, along with some short stories to read and a few creative exercises like character sketches and stream-of-consciousness compositions. S&S doesn't require a lot of work, and maybe about half of what you write gets workshopped. However, you're basically guaranteed to *not* get an A, and getting an A- is difficult, though I don't think worrying about the grade is the right perspective to take with regard to a creative writing class.

No exaggeration, this was the absolutely worst class I have taken at Columbia.  The course itself is very interesting.  I am a math major and only took the class because of the material covered in the class.  However, Prof. Gross is completely inept.  He has this attitude that he is a math genious and if students are naturally inclined in math they will understand his lectures, if not, tough on the student.  I agree that this course covers a huge array of topics and the class is very time pressured, but Gross makes minimal attempt to lecture well.  His notes that accompany the book are absolutely horrible and worthless (I learned the material from the book which is actually a very well written text).  Half of Gross' lectures are anecdotes from his life: he has told us numerous stories when he was a kid and how brilliant he was in math and other information about his life.  Also, he never writes on the blackboard (I have never seen this done especially since this is a MATH course...).  He explains the concepts poorly and rushes through topics that are very important (I guess I can't totally blame him for this since the syllabus is very dense).  However, he expects the students to understand all material as if we spent days on each topic.  For example, in my 4000 level math class it took us 40 minutes to go over Cantor's proof for the uncountability of real numbers, but somehow Gross showed us the same proof in the last 2 minutes of class.  All I know is that if I didn't previously see a lot of the material taught in this class I would be completely lost.  A lot of the material seen in this class is covered in a lot of the higher level math classes and I find it hard to believe Gross expects the students to understand the material at this level.  Now, onto his tests.  I have never taken a test that is so off topic with the material covered in class.  His tests only test you on your natural grasp of math and minimally tests you on the information covered in class.  I learned after the 2 midterms that I could have studied for another 30 more hours and not have received a higer grade.  For example, his problems seem at first glance a straight forward easy problem.  However, there usually involves one tricky step that has nothing to do with discrete math (it usually has to do with ""seeing"" a shortcut or something like that).  Each question is similar to that: you either see the trick or you don't.  If you don't see it, you will probably will not be able to start the problem and receive 0 points on it (and this hurts since the test consists of only 5 or 6 problems).  Overall, (and I really do hate writing negative comments for a professor) I would say run as fast as you can from this class.  If you do not need to take this class as a requirement then don't.  I found this out the hard way.
Workload:
The workload is very light.  6 problem sets which are not long at all (especially since we get over 2 weeks to complete each one) and 2 midterms and 1 final.  For the midterms look over the sample midterms on the website.  These are the best ways to study for the tests since the tests he gives every year are very similar in style.

    In all honesty, my incredible experience with Professor Beardman likely has as much to do with my approach to philosophy at the time as her teaching style. I went into that class a fresh, engaged, newly declared phlosophy major - eager to learn and willing to work, and she met me at every step. She assigned readings for every class, I did them; she assigned papers, I wrote them, she asked for web-postings, I posted them. And, ya know what? It was phenomenal.
     If you don't like doing work, are looking for an easy A, or want professors to spoonfeed and pamper you, then Professor Beardman may not be the right professor for you. However, if you are truly interested in a given domain of knowledge, taking a class with Professor Beardman will be absolutely amazing.

Definitely one of the worst experiences in my life. You may as well never go to class becasue she poorly teaches right out of the crapy text and sleeping in your own bed is probably more comfortable anyway. She talks to the board, gets irritated easily by questions, poorly answers those questions (becasue she is never actually listening to them), delivers an unorganized lecture, does long complicated derivations that are not imperitive to learning the material at hand, and always runs out of time so that she ends up trying to teach an entire chapter in 10-15 min. Waste of time when it comes to office hours. Ask for help and she'll simply tell you to ""do more problems. It will click. That is why the final is worth 50% of your grade.""

On average he covers about 1/3 of the material you are going to need for the midterms/exam. The 3 midterms are easy becasue he takes all of the questions from the practice questions he gives you.

If you're interested in dance history, this class will make your head spin. (I mean that in the nicest way possible!) In just one semester, we covered dance in classical Greece, flamenco, African dance, Haitian dance, capoeira, dance in ancient Egypt, belly dance, classical Indian dance, Balinese and Javanese dance, Peking Opera, kabuki, butoh, hula, Native American dance, tango, and so many more. I occasionally thought my arm was going to shrivel up and fall off from writing so much, but I'm glad we covered as much as we did. I was never bored. 
Professor Scolieri is young and relatively new to the department (although, as he explained to us, he majored in dance when he was a student at CC in the early '90s, making him ""the first boy to graduate from Barnard""!) He's very inspired and enthusiastic, and this translates well in the classroom. Classes sometimes run 10 minutes longer because he wants to finish what he has to say and there's no way you can deny him that. He's just too bright and loveable. Even if a particular topic doesn't thrill you, you'll find yourself wanting to learn as much as you can about it just so you can understand where he's coming from. He's a very inspiring and funny lecturer and is always willing to meet with you if you have questions or just want to talk about the material.

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! I do not know how to say this more clearly. The reason is that you will learn nothing although you may get a ""not too bad"" grade on the class. This guy cannot teach. If he did not take attendance not even one student would go to a single lecture throughout the semester since the lectures are so pointless. His exams are not that hard; because everything is from problems that were solved before. You will never be able to understand the material completely. So, sometimes (or all the time) you will need memorize how problems are solved. Furthermore, his homeworks are tedious and long since you do not know how to approach the problems. Therefore, you have to read everything on your own and teach the material to yourself. In other words, there is no point in having Kou as a teacher. Exams are not that hard but towards the end of the semester you will reach a point where you will ask yourself ""Do I really have to do this?"" or ""Is it Kou's job to teach at least one thing?"". If you have the chance take this with someone else since the material is in fact interesting and a good teacher may make you like it which would help you a lot in the future in courses like Stochastic Models or Econometrics...

Prof. Billows, for better or for worse, is a solid teacher who knows a lot about the first-semester CC material and relates it very well to current ideas, events, and politics.  His historical accounts did get a little boring, but they only last a little bit of the class; the majority of the time is spent trying desperately to answer his important yet highly-philosophical questions that really require a quick mind and a broad understanding of the material.  Even days when it was clear no one had read, he could get the class riled up.  Some may say that he shoots down people, which is kind of true, but he makes sure to simply point out the holes of the many stupid arguments that may come up.  This keeps discussions on target, focused, and engaging.  CC is not hard, but Billows defintiely asks the tough questions and genuinely wants people to think about their responses.

What a good teacher! GO AHEAD AND TAKE EVERY SINGLE CLASS SHE TEACHES. She explains everything step by step and when you walk out of her lectures you really know and understand more about Microeconomics. Her homeworks are not easy but they will make you understand the material even better. Her exams are challenging but doable. You will never see any weird questions. All exam questions are very similar to homework problems. So, if you understand the homework problems you should be fine in the exams. However, you should be careful with her wording since she wants to make you think and not solve the problems like a machine. You need to go to every single class if you want to do well in this class. There is absolutely no need for the book since everything is explained in the lecture. She may seem mean and tough at the beginning but you will understand what a good teacher she is at the end of the semester. Most people will screw up at the midterm (this semester the average was 57) but if you improve at the final she gives you some bonus and considers this improvement when she assings the final grade for the class.

I thought Macroeconomics would be more interesting than Micro and I was completely disappointed. And the only reason is the way Bruce presents the material.

His lectures are not interesting at all. And since they are at 9 in the morning after a month you will not go to any of the lectures. His homeworks are so long and there are not enough examples to make you understand the analytical questions. I mean he is not too bad but not too good either. The midterm was OK but looooong. The final was even worse. I think this class can be very interesting if the professor puts the necessary effort into it. I went to his office hourse a couple times and he never gives you precise explanations and confuses you even more. I would certainly not recommend him if you want to learn something.

I thought this course, as well as the professor, was great. I had practically no experience in dance, and I took a lot from this course. However, I also think that if I had had some experience I could have taken even more, so it's a great course for beginners and advanced students alike.
This class is a lot smaller than her Dance in New York class (11 students compared to 35), so I didn't notice any of the ""playing favorites"" which pervades her other reviews. Lynn is extremely knowledgeable in her field, and I thought that made her very interesting to listen to when she went off on tangents. I guess I can see the other reviewers point of view; if you don't have a strong interest in dance, Garafola might not be a good professor for you. Not that you won't gain anything, but she teaches as if all her listerners are dance majors, so if you're not, you (like me) might not understand what she is talking about half the time. But that didn't keep me from learning a lot from her and the course, so I fully recommend her.
As a side note, I think it's true what they say about culpa: it's mostly only those who had strong feelings about the class posting reviews. So Garafola may not be great for everybody, but she is definitely not as bad as most of these reviews make her out to be.

If you took AP physics in high school, and passed the test, this class should mostly be a breeze, as far as concepts go.
Hailey is a very good lecturer, he could keep my attention for an hour before I had to look at the clock, and the remaining half hour wasn't too bad. I thought he made the topics very clear and comprehensible. In class, this guy is great.
But other than his lectures, this guy sucks. The homework sets were very easy, and the problems on the homework were not even remotely similar in format to those on the midterms or final, so they didn't help at all. Not to mention that only having 10 problems to cover an entire topic is not enough to learn it, and since his tests are vastly different than what the book has for problems, going through the book and doing problems on your own is a waste of time.
The curve in the class is ridiculous. If you're satisfied with a B, you'll have no problem in this class, i think 2/3 of the class gets between a B- and B+, but if you want an A- or A, you'll have to work like hell, already know physics better than he can teach it, or just be really really smart. 
This review is mostly useless, because he is starting his research project over in Japan, so I don't think he is even going to be here next year.

In my opinion, Professor Bower is patronizing, obnoxious, and unfocused. He didn't hand out a syllabus at the beginning of the course and seemed to talk about whatever he wanted.  He handed out several pounds of handouts every class, most of which he never mentioned, much less taught the material. Assignments in lecture were ludicrous--two mandatory trips to the American Natural History Museum, where we spent 2-3 hours drawing pictures of red-backed voles and tracing maps of Alaska for no apparent reason. The end-of-term Hudson River lab report made kindergarten connect-the-dots look challenging. There is NO curriculum for this course. Labs included using colored pencils to color globes and food chains, dissecting owl pellets, and two trips to the river which consisted of walked to 125th Street and back. I would not recommend this class to anyone under any circumstances. I learned nothing, wasted six hours a week in lecture and lab, and have five inches worth of useless photocopies to show for it.

You really have to give Robin an A for effort.  She tried so hard to make this class exciting.  The class itself is so flawed.  It's geared towards the ""nonscience"" type which basically just means all the problem sets are written in cryptic baby language.  I would say (at best) 50% of the class actually attended lecture.  I mean, who the hell goes to a 9:00 AM FRIDAY lecture!?!? (especially when you can just read it later because they post it on the website). The difficulty level of this class wasn't very hard at all.  However, 30% of our grade was based on our section.  Other section leaders had zero homework.  Ours had busywork.... I know Robin didn't want to hand out grades based on a whim, but it was kind of frustrating to see other people in frontiers slacking off while we had to do somewhat stupid projects.

The ""character assassination"" that one reviewer attempted is totally wrong-headed and mean-spirited.  Jaleh is one of the most interesting graduate students I've had at Columbia; the fact that her method of teaching Art Hum involves a lot of contemporary criticism (and some resulting jargon, like ""desublimate,"" ""problematize"") simply makes the class better and more interesting to a contemporary audience.  Other teachers are likely to rehash old, dead arguments, and make the works seem, consequently, old and dead.  Though I'm not an art history major, the stuff I learned from her class gave me material for a senior thesis.  If I had time, I would gladly take another art history class.

The previous reviewer criticizes Prof. Mendelson's lectures as ""moralistic.""  They are indeed moralistic, which is one of the reasons Mendelson is an excellent professor.  Unlike many humanities professors who seem incapable of forming coherent moral judgements, Mendelson will give his opinion about the moral implications of a work of literature.  His moral judgements are often surprising and challenging, you may not agree with all of them but they certainly deserve to be taken seriously.  In general, Mendelson's views of the literature you study in this course (Hardy, Conrad, Joyce, Woolf, Yeats, Auden, Eliot, Wilde) are nuanced, untraditional and challenging.  His understanding of Auden really seems to be top-rate (he is Auden's literary executor), this was a highlight.  His critique of how poetry is usually taught is both hilarious and right on the mark.  Yeats and Joyce he is perhaps not so strong on, but still very worth listening to.  (The way he teaches Yeats is radically different than how I had been taught Yeats before.  I wasn't entirely convinced of his point of view, but it was completely cogent and very interesting.)
Two previous reviewers complained that Mendelson is like a high-school teacher.  There seem to me to be three conclusions that you could draw from this:
1. They didn't really understand his lectures.
2. They went to a much better and more interesting high school than I did.
3.  They were upset that Mendelson didn't indulge in the virtually meaningless post-modern jargon that many humanities profs seem to prefer.
Frankly, the first explanation seems like the most likely to me.  If you are a rigid thinker, only willing to understand literature in terms of absolutes, his lectures will be of little value; as he once said in reference to a specific point he was making, ""It requires tact to understand this, but that doesn't mean it isn't right.""  That quote describes most of Mendelson's understanding of literature.  I highly recommend him.

You get a lot out of Taylor's class, but ultimately it takes more out of you. By reputation, Taylor has more moments of arrogance than of brilliance, though both occur frequently. The teaching style can get annoying quickly and classes are often frought with tension. He picks out passages or asks general thematic questions and calls on students to elucidate them, which can be exruciatingly difficult with heidegger, derrida, and the like. Moreover, a lot of interesting discussions that could occur around these texts are subsumed into Taylor's lecture agenda. In class time, Taylor's not necessarily resistent to contrary opinions to his own, he just doesn't care about them. (In your writings it's best to stick to his literal interpretations - he's stubborn.) Most people in the class seem to have a sort of love-hate relationship to it. You learn a lot of interesting things with a man who's an expert on just about everything that happens in Western thought after Hegel, but his resistances, pretentions, over-intensity (control freak, as he readily admits) and faux niceness start to wear on you.

Upon reflection, this was one of the most important classes I've taken at CU.  It certainly was challenging, and Professor Stacey expects a lot.  But he rewards those who attend class by both giving exams that pick up on his worthwhile lectures AND spicing up IR theory.
The policy-making simulations were the most interesting, but I was most impressed by the things Professor Stacey talked about to illustrate points on the board, tying in current events, new developments, and recent trends and the like.
Or just riffing on things, like the day he used examples from Thucydides' Melian Dialogue and Sparta's decision to go to war with Athens.  I asked him about it later, because he didn't lecture about it or assign readings on it.  I couldn't believe he just plucked it out of the air and broke down some highly complex events in a digestible - and funny - manner, way better than an earlier class in which a prof lectured a lot on such material (THAT is what makes challenging classes worthwhile).

OK, just to clear up some misunderstandings that have arisen from the reviews on Roberts. I took his class last spring (yet I had such an unpleasant experience that I still remember it like it was yesterday), and he was a nice enough guy trying to come off as the students' friend by attempting to turn the 1 hour and 15 minute lecture sections into a discussion.  What ended up happening was people voicing remarkably stupid comments/questions, and any lectures or information to be taught were hastily thrown at the class in the last 10 minutes.  Also, the lectures, when he decided to give them, were horribly dry and boring, making the amazingly interesting topics seem incredibly offputting. (Like one reviewer wrote, even the TA's, who were great by the way, didn't know what the heck he was looking for.) Oh, and don't try and blame my ""negative tone'"" on not doing the work or cutting class: I went to all the lectures and did every single assingment (although, now I regret having wasted so much precious time).  So again, you can overlook this pathetic excuse of a class due to his inexperience, or what have you, yet this does not change that it is a large disappointment, and at over $800 a credit, you deserve much better.

Mesznik- great teacher & a guy that has a personality...He makes the material easy to learn, but make sure to pay attention in class because he likes to pick on those who look lost.  If you're at all interested in finance after graduation, you should take this class with Mesznik, he will explain the ins and outs of basic corporate finance for you.  He is good with grading, if you do well enough on the midterm you dont have to take the final.  Everyone gets similar grades on the case study, so basically the midterm/optional final are where your grade comes from.  Really good prof.

I definitely completed this class with a far better understanding of Spanish than I had when I started. The assignments are relatively straightforward; practically everything comes out of the textbook. Hernandez, or ""Pepe"" as we called him, was not the most approachable guy ever, but he was very charming and funny and our class laughed out loud a lot. He encourages speaking aloud and this is definitely not the class to take if you're not comfortable discussing issues and acting (that's right...as in a play) in Spanish. Overall, I learned a lot and laughed a lot, so I would recommend Hernandez's section to someone who has to fulfill the language requirement. My grade, however, seemed a little low for all the work I did.

Thank God I took MusicHum with Professor Lependorf.  First, it's obvious he loves music and knows so much about it... his passion was just overflowing and that made his lectures cool.  In terms of accessibility, he was ALWAYS available via email to have questions answered.  I was terrified of this class (I'm not into the math behind the music, so some of the concepts were really just impossibly hard for me) and Professor Lependorf was very accomodating in terms of helping me figure out stuff. Can't say enough good things.

if you like history, definitely take this class...it was great. professor frey is a well organized and engaging lecturer and though his jokes were not exactly stand-up material, i suppose they add character to the class and the fact that he knows they are bad jokes makes them amusing. discussions were interesting and informal as well...go to them (participation is helps). it was also nice to finally understand what the hell was going on in that country over the past hundred years and how it all happened. the only problem is that the professor and alex moulton (the TA, who happens to be well informed and helpful) are somewhat tough graders.

All the reviews of Katz so far say he is either wonderful or horrible. I think heÂ’s somewhere in the middle. He really does seem interested in the class and in helping students. His cheesy (and repetitive) jokes, whether you think theyÂ’re funny or irritating, definitely lighten the atmosphere. His exams could be worse. On the other hand, I found his lectures tended to be disorganized and sometimes confusing. Although he wants to help, heÂ’s not the most spectacular teacher in the world, so sometimes he doesnÂ’t know how. In his effort to get students not to stress about the class, he sometimes brushes off important questions. His problem sets are graded and often devilishly hard, but the TAs were quite willing to help with them.

I agree with the above reviewer.  Something was missing.  I don't recommend the class. The readings were good, but if you want writting practice, you're probably better off someplace else.  It seemed like the professor was talking at us instead of to us a lot of times. (Maybe that is why ""stiff"") And it was a chore to do the work,because he wasn't hearing me and had a too fixed agenda about what we were supposed to get from the readings.  Also he spoke way too quiet.  I know a guy who dropped the class the first week just because he couldn't hear what the man was saying, even from the second row.

Terrible Terrible Terrible.  She has to be one of the worst university writing teachers out there, and that says something considering the generally terrible teachers in the UW department.  She doesn't know what she's doing, and that comes through in the way the class is taught.  One day she showed up to class without a syllabus and she had no idea what she was doing and then let the class go an hour early because she was so lost.  Also, when she pronounces adverbs (especially those that end in ""ally""), it sounds like she is saying ""bay-sik-ahh-leee"" and it gets really annoying after a while.  You'll see what I mean.  She also is really bad at proofreading and made one person write ""In this essay, I will discuss..."" as their thesis.  Are we still in 3rd grade?  She is a joke and so is this class.

Professor Dehejia is really solid on her material. She's worked extensively in both research and curating fields, and is a pretty well-renowned figure in Indian art circles. Her lectures are extremely informative and insightful, and she tends to encourage student participation at all times, especially on class readings. Her command of the subject is overall terrific. The only problem that I found, and it wasn't really a huge issue at all, was her lack of warmth. While she occasionally liked to joke with students, she was one of my least personable professors, which was particularly frustrating as she's such an authority in her field. Other than that, it's a great class to take if you're interested in this topic.

First off, I have to echo a warning from another reviewer: the class didnÂ’t cover what most of my classmates expected. Public Economics is essentially the study of theoretical choice mechanisms. It has nothing to do with public policy, or anything of practical use for that matter. It was much like a Philosophy class in this respect. Some of my classmates found this very frustrating, but they dropped the class almost immediately. By the way, we covered different material than the previous sessions, so take all these reviews with a grain of salt, especially when it comes to content.
I was relatively comfortable with the focus of the class, but found it exasperating for two other reasons. First, I have never experienced a dynamic in which there was so little interaction between a professor and his students. I could have been watching it all on video. Professor Miyagawa is extremely patient and helpful when a question arises, but it seems to throw him off track, and he never encouraged it. Thankfully, he shines when it comes to explaining difficult concepts and is very meticulous and organized in his lesson plan. It is best to just let him go and save your questions for later. (Unfortunately some of my classmates never caught on to this.)
Second, there was no text, and very little homework. Personally, I need a text to help reinforce what is taught in class. The subject matter is so obscure that there was nothing in the library to help me through the rough spots. With only a few problem sets, I found it difficult to pace my study and had no idea how well I was retaining what had been taught. Also, because there were few problem sets, the midterm and the final essentially determines your grade. I was surprised both times with the questions we were asked on the exams. Unlike the previous review, I found the proofs largely irrelevant, although I do agree they were interesting.
It wasnÂ’t all bad. Miyagawa is an animated and quirky professor, and class was more interesting than not. The theorems we explored were generally useless, but they were also genuinely interesting.
I found this class very difficult. You really need a solid background in mathematical proofs, as well as microeconomics. Honestly, it seemed like a third of the class was completely lost, a third were struggling, and a third found it easy and couldnÂ’t understand what all the fuss was about. I was in the middle third. I managed to get by on what I know, but only because the curve was so strong.
In short, I canÂ’t say I recommend this class, unless you are the type of person who wouldnÂ’t find fault with what IÂ’ve mentioned. Certain types of people just love this sort of thing, I know. As for me, IÂ’m going to look elsewhere next semester.

Old Shell-Bell has her ups and downs.  She is very kind, and when she is on task she comes through as a brilliant professor.  Her kindness factors in when it comes to understanding difficulties in handing in papers and such.  You fall asleep in class, she says ""You kids don't get enough sleep.""  Sometimes our class lagged, but maybe that was more due to students not quite chomping at the bit to dive into the texts.  When things do get cooking, she leads a decent enough discussion, usually spending half of the class period lecturing to learn you the main ideas of each book and the other half seeing what you thought.  Her main interest is political philosophy, but you can draw her into the other themes of the texts easily enough simply by showing enthusiasm.  You could ask for more from a CC professor, but she certainly beats a lot of the bums they have out there in that she's very nice, smart, and open to hear students' ideas.

It was an honor to take this woman's short prose forms course and then review her in the noblest of all such forms, the Culpa review.  You've got a ton of choices in this department coursewise, and this one is delightful if only because writing short prose is quick, potentially a real challenge, and provides some damn fine stuff to workshop of your fellow students.  Leslie is a real swell teacher, a woman young at heart with a penchant for rambling in a lovable way about the nuances of writing and the ins and outs of life.

After receiving a class-wide e-mail from Prof. Stacey yesterday that thanked us ""for the many nice comments,"" a classmate IMed me and asked, ""Who gave nice comments?  Were they deaf?""  Hands down, Professor Stacey was the worst professor I've ever had!  His lectures are dry summaries of the readings, which he often can't even get straight.  His answers to simple questions turn into vague ramblings on obscure topics as he tries to circumvent questions he can't answer.
 The first day, I knew the class would be bad!  He arrogantly assumes that all students are up to date on international current events and are familiar with unimportant international politics abbreviations such as WTO, GDP, and ITC.  He only caters to the typical nerdy Columbia student, while forgetting those of us he don't spend our weekends with our noses in the Wall Street Journal or the latest copy of the Economist.  Furthermore, he pompously assumes that all students plagiarize and seems to go out of his way to accuse, if not catch, students of being ""involved in dishonesty.""  His constant warnings against plagiarism leave students bewildered about the presence of some level of trust that seems to be required for a successful learning environment.
He tries unsuccessfully to get to know his students by inviting them to attend political lectures and events with him, but the invitations stop coming after the first few weeks.  Maybe he got a clue - nobody's interested!  Moreover, he tries to redeem himself with two policy simulations in class where he dons a mask or impersonates a president.  It's hard to laugh a such a dull man, though!
I would not recommend Professor Stacey for this class, let alone any other.  I wish I had waited to take this class with a better prof., maybe even one with a Ph.D!

Professor Matin is a really nice old man. He's friendly and kind, and wants his students to do well.

Professor McPhee is herself really nice. She's extremely well-informed about her field of interest, and enjoys communicating her knowledge and enthusiasm to the class. Her lectures, although delivered in a somewhat ""read directly from the page"" format, are articulate and bursting with information. The class itself was a great overview of the Baroque - covering many major artists from Italy, France, and Spain. The only thing that hampered the experience was the fact that since the focus of the course was so large to begin with, we didn't get a chance to thoroughly explore individual pieces, which was pretty disappointing at times. She tended to whiz through too many slides, so that instead of really comprehending the techniques and theories that each artist employed, we ended up getting brief glimpses into their styles. This, however, rarely detracted from her eagerness and her sometimes inspiring lectures. Her passions - from Caravaggio to Bernini (especially the latter) - in art history are particularly well-documented in the lectures. She is incredibly friendly and welcoming, although a stickler for rules and guidelines, and she loves furthering discussion in office hours. For an in-depth comprehension of individual artists, I would not recommend this class. Each lecture covered a segment that could probably have taken an entire semester to properly study. On the other hand, she really is a terrific and shrewd scholar, and if you're interested in taking the time to talk to her personally about anything you want to explore, she is always encouraging. 
Workload:
The workload for this class was the biggest turn-off. On the first day she said that she saw she had given us much more reading than most other classes, which is entirely true. There was no coursepack either (major problem), with the result that we ended up spending hours in Avery every week, just to keep up. The readings factored into exams (although she often gave hints beforehand), so it was definitely necesarry to keep up on some level. The exams and papers were equally hard. The first paper was a traditional analysis of a painting at the MET, although this was v. strictly graded. The second was a discussion of an article. The midterm and final (cumulative) were obscene. We had to know about 170 slides for the first and double that number for the second, sometimes including location as part of the IDs. Besides having to know the readings, be able to dissect paintings on the spot, and to write coherent essays, this was incredibly demanding, and deserved weeks of preparation which most students were unable to give. The grading, though overall fair, was not curved as perhaps it should have been. A lot of people ended up having to pass/fail this course. The amazing material, however, tends to make up for the abominable workload.

I wasn't sure about taking this class, given the mostly negative reviews from 2002, but Prof. Adams seems to have improved since she last taught it. It's worth taking for the reading list alone, given the authors (Stein, Pound, Eliot, Fitzgerald, Hurston, Faulkner, Agee/Evans) that are on the syllabus. Prof. Adams incorporated a lot of art and a few films (including Chaplin's Modern Times) into the course, which helped with the examination of modernism and was especially useful with Stein and Agee/Evans. Prof. Adams had a lot to say, most of which was useful, though she did have some problems teaching the poetry unit, which was one of the least interesting parts of the class. She incorporated some discussion into the lecture to some success, and there was a reading group open to graduates and interested undergrads. The one issue with this class was that you pretty much can't skip lectures - the midterm and final were very difficult to do well on unless you had attended most of the classes or knew someone who took phenomenal notes. Other than that, I found this class to be a good intro to twentieth century American lit and a well-detailed exploration of modernism.

The class does a wonderful job of relating the movements to one another, and thought KJ as a historian largely relies on the factual details in order to build a full picture for her students, she also is very careful about allowing time for questions and discussion to assure that students take the time in class to digest all the theory through the facts she provides.

Its an old class in terms of its dry material about the great wars, cmc, nuclear strategy, etc. Light on transnational issues: societal conflicts environmental threats, civil wars, terrorism, heavy on WW 1 and 2.  Moreover, its not only old material--presented in a dull fashion--but lots of it. You will be thrown close to 4000 pages of reading many of which you will have to trek to Lehman and read  for two hours at a time since they are reserve-only readings. Plus, the mt & f are bland and lazy in format and they will not test how much you know or the value of what you do know--youll just have to guess and hope--which is totally stupid for the couple of grand of tuition the course ends up costing. This class is annoying, difficult to navigate within the limits of  a reasonable schedule and though its unique benefit is knowing that you have taken a class that has a reputation for being difficult it will do you no academic good. Last, heads up the prof reads his lectures from a paper at you.

ARGH. I was looking forward to this class, but it turned out to be the biggest pain I had all semester. Prof. Beardman was nice in class, and she incorporated a lot of discussion (prob. because our ""lecture"" had only 15 students in it), but between the overly-broad scope of the class and the madness of having to write 400 word papers (that were graded very harshly) I hated going to class by October. I agree with the previous reviewer who said that the class should be less broad - I felt like I didn't really gain a deep enough understanding of anything we discussed. Writing 400 word papers may have sounded good in theory, but again, I didn't get to develop any sort of detailed argument. If you're a major, find another way to get rid of the ethic requirement, and if you're not, P/F this class if you're going to take it at all.
Workload:
Two papers or so to read for each class, maybe about 20 pages on average. Five 400 word papers (one of which was a rewrite), which are graded very difficultly. A final which made me memorize a lot of terms that I don't really remember now. Not too much work, but you'll never want to do it.

I have to second the first review of this class. (1) The book was very babyishÂ— a lot of material you aren't going to be tested on written in a moralistic tone (2) The tests are multiple choice tests made up by Dr. Hart and have some very arbitrary questions on them. I went to every 9 a.m. class and still had trouble with them, though I wound up with a good grade in the class (3) The material is presented with a very real biasÂ…medical marijuana is goodÂ…there are too many people in jail on drug-related charges.
On a positive note, Dr. Hart did provide review sheets for the midterms and final. 
These were helpful but by no means comprehensive, and you really need to study your notes very closely and pay attention in class to do well. I also thought Dr. Hart's lectures were well-organized and clear. His power point slides did not have tons of information on them and he went at a good pace. Finally, Dr. Hart did try to make the class entertaining. He showed several videos and film clips that made the material more real.
Overall, I would say that if you are prepared to go to every class and study inane details for tests, you'll do fine.

Ms. Hemmasi (or Farzi as she prefers to be called) is a phenomenal music hum instructor. She makes the class engaging and interesting (even at 9:00 in the morning!), and does not intend to trick you on her tests. If know the music she wants you to know even remotely, and you understand the basic concepts, this class should be a breeze. That is not to say you should not take it seriously.

A wonderful teacher who truly cares whether you understand the material or not. While this may frustrate the quicker members of the class, I was heartened to see how he never failed to explain things thoroughly to those who didn't grasp the concepts immediately (this is an INTRO class after all--and if you already know all the things he's teaching, why are you taking this class anyway?). A young, flexible guy, he was quick to adapt his teaching to the general level of the class after gauging our receptiveness and comprehension. He was readily available outside of class too, and knows many of his students by name. His self-deprecating sense of humor made a class held this late actually enjoyable. Take this class especially if you've feared even the tiniest bit of math like the bogeyman--you'll get a nice introduction to the world of finance and get over your irrational phobia of numbers. His natural enthuasiasm and curiosity for his subject shines through, and makes you wonder: Why can't all lecturers be this witty and engaged?

I agree that Prof Kou doesn't care much whether he is teaching 100 or 2 people. But actually, if you went to class and made some effort to listen to him and copy his slides, things aren't that bad. Exams are based strictly on homeworks, case studies and recitation problems. So if you took some effort in reviewing those before the exam, you will do great. He won't ask anything he hasn't mentioned in class. I agree, he can be boring and hard to understand but he is quite a nice guy in general, his curve is so good that you will be in the A range quite easily. If you have a choice, you should probably take someone else's class, but if you are stuck with Kou (as most of us are) then make sure you go to class and it's really not that bad.

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! This was the first semester of Prof Aho's experiment in teaching programming and computer science concepts at the same time. Classes were very confusing and tried to teach you material that encompasses complex computer science matter, the book sucks, and whatever you learn in class doesn't help in any way with the programming assignment. Thank god the TAs were awesome, that's how I can say I walked out of this class feeling that I can actually write a program. Their assignment were very interesting and they (the TAs) were available to help virtually 24/7. I am very disappointed with the theoretical part of the class however, and the theory problem sets (aside from the programming assignments!) were not only ridiculous but impossible and unmanageable.

Sethi is very inacessible, he talks to fast, and is always very thin on his patience.

Have you ever walked out of class absolutely retaining nothing from the class, well that is Sethi for you.  HE IS ALSO VERY UNACCOMADATING.  This class was a BIG BIG disappointment (maybe its because he just got tenure).  The midterm is okay, but the final is really hard and worth 50% of your grade.

The topics this class is attempting to address (origin of the universe, nature of reality, nature of consciousness, etc.) are so huge individually that a comparative discussion in the course of one semester is bound to have shortcomings.  That said, there were many interesting readings, and Pollack's lectures are worth the price of admission.  This course has two professors: Pollack does the Western science and religion sections & Joe Loizzo does the Eastern sections.  Pollack is incredibly articulate, and makes even the most obstruse readings seem simple.  He comes to class well prepared, and his lectures have structured arguments.  This guy is really smart, and has fascinating ways of justifing his religious beliefs with his scientific ones.  Loizzo is clearly a less experienced teacher, and did not always succeed in bringing across his ideas.  He also focused mainly on Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, which I found far less interesting than the East Asian Buddhism and Taoism with which I was already familiar.  I could have done without all the 10th century Buddhist influenced, Hindu influenced, Indian philosophy, of which there was a lot and from which I got very little.  Perhaps others found these readings more enlightening though.  
This was the first time the course has been taught (fall '03), and it will doubtless be much better next time around.  But it got me thinking about  interesting stuff and was well worth taking.  The papers were very open ended, and could be based on only the reading from class if you wanted.  I did much better on both papers than I expected.

Overall not a bad class. I learned something about women in politics and didn't have to kill myself to get a good grade. Class discussions could be very interesting but also in need of a balancing voice to counter the ""women-are-all-powerful-and-better-than-

As far as workload, readings could be skimmed or skipped. I read only what I found interesting and did fine. No need to buy any of the books for the class; all are on reserve and used once or twice. That said, I learned a lot from my own research topic and two presentations.

This man is utterly incompetent. Going to class consists of you sitting there and staring while he copies code for data structures such as linked list or disjoint sets on the blackboard VERBATIM from the text. He doesn't even bother to change variable names. He basically stands there and reads the textbook to you in a somewhat difficult to understand accent. Sometimes he makes fun of people (especially people who leave) but that's the high point of class. Personally, I didn't go to any of his classes at all except the midterm and final.
What ends up actually is that the four or five TAs for the class are the real teachers. Laziness overtakes the average student and most of them do the learning from the homework assignments. Usually people ask questions via the bulletin board which sometimes complicates things (for example, the second homework turned into a swing nightmare once a few students started asking about implementing scroll bars and other gui components to a simple tree application). Don't worry though. The curve is spectacular. I'm not even a CS major and I did the minimum but still scored an A+.

This course is da bomb!! The easiest material ever if you are good at algebra/precalculus/logic/drawing pictures. The course consists of some select topics which Gross does not like to go into depth in. The course itself covers a large number of topics, but none extremely deeply. Going to class is a waste of time except for his jokes, as he basically reads his notes (you can do this in the comfort of your dorm room). The homeworks are a joke as the solution manuals solve similar problems (only the numbers are changed around). The exams are also pretty easy as they are open book and open notes. An overly dumb SEAS contingency lowers the median so as long as you score about 95 or so on each midterm and the final, you are set for an A+.

This class is overrated.  Dr. M's lectures are terribly vague, disorganized, and superficial.  Dr. Chasin just happily ploughs along the first few weeks that he has to teach.  He's not better than Dr M, but at least his lectures are organized.  The TA's are a toss-up.  Some are clueless and others are better teachers than the professors.  The material is very interesting, but you're better off reading the textbook instead of going to class (half the class did this after the 2nd midterm, leaving lots of room for ass-kissing postbacs to attend the morning lecture).  The problem book is only helpful if you understand the concepts.  This class is run like Communist China.  Exams are are poorly written and ambiguous, and graded somewhat abitrarily.  Sometimes all you need to do well is a little luck (for guessing the correct multiple choice answer) and a knack for giving ambiguous answers to the equally ambiguous questions.  Grading: ok, so first there's the monumentally stupid idea of handing back the exams in a lecture of 300-400 people, unless you like to get trampled by a mob.  Blatant misgrading is the least of your worries(and it happens quite a bit).  Sometime they'll lose your exam, or hand you back an exam that will have pages from someone's exam.  Don't expect them to do anything about it.  They 'll snark about the most inane to the most valid concern about grading.  Plus, there's no guarantee that, if you are pre-med, that the course will cover material relevant to the MCATS.     If you are a bio major, you ought to be good enough to opt out of this course (there have been such people who've weaseled their way out of this course).

A very solid class. Prof. Kosto is a pretty good lecturer. He has a very good understanding of the overarching social, political, religious and economic developments that occur over this 800 year period and conveys it very nicely in lecture. He weaves together this very rich period of history, full of migrations, identity formation,  the interrelation of the developments in Byzantium, Persia, Islam, and the West in a masterful way. Go to lecture. The readings are OK. I wish the textbook were a little more factually involved but it still gives an excellent feel for the trends and movements of the Early Middle Ages. The primary sources are great too. This is a 1000 level history course -- so be prepared for being pegged on footnoting and bibliography issues. I wish it were less a class on developing critical  analysis skills, but then again it is a 1000 level course and for those who havent acquired such skills a course like this is necessary. The TA sections are OK -- not great. The TAs do tend to grade a little harshly but whatever -- if you dont care too much about maintaining a sparkling 4.0 GPA but do care about learning, take this class. You will gain a deep insight into what happened to the late Roman Empire, the rise of Christianity and the Papacy, the ""barbarian invasions"", impact of Charlemagne upon Europe, the impact of Islam upon Europe, the birth of feudalism and much much more.

Although I would go into the midterm knowing nothing about what he wanted i came  out with a very high grade.  My best advice when it comes to his section of a test...bullshit you whoel way throug...you will find yourself entirely suprised to get full credit fro an answer that you did not know.  An addditional note is tat anderson teaches this calsss with another senior professor named mutter who is extremly systemic.  Also in some ways it si not nessary for you to coem to class but in other ways it is.  One's grade is evaluated entirely on the  midter and final.  Attendance is never taken.  The pluses of this class is that you are being taught bya  senior professor.  the negatives is taht it is very easy to not want to attend classes and fall behind i the reading.

Though this class is technically intended for students who do not have a background in physics, like myself, it is close to impossible to grasp the amount of required material in one semester. Ontop of that Sciulli does not make it any easier. Firstly, his lectures are straight out of the amazingly horrible text book. except for the occasional video clip. Out of the over 100 students in the class only a good 1/3 bothered showing up to lectures mostly cause they already knew everything. The only good thing about going to the lectures is that some of his demos were interresting. Otherwise he breezed through about 15 chapters of the book and spent forever on the easiest things like thermodynamics and fluids. To say the least, this was not an enjoyable first experience with physics. If you have the oppertunity to take the other section by all means do so!!

Professor Leung was an amazing professor, possibly one of the best to teach econometrics.  I would know, as I took econometrics with Prof. Das the semster before, who did a horrible job.  Though Edward may have some problem with the language barrier, he does understand what he is saying.  Once you become accustomed to his accent, there is no way he could be misunderstood.  In addition, he not only writes down every example on the board during class, he also posts them online, which for some could mean that class attendance is optional.  The TA's are usually available and do take partial credit into account.  But the main point is Professor Leung.  He is kind, knowledgable, and somehow manages to clearly teach topics which could otherwise be painfully unbearable.

AVOID MITALI DAS LIKE THE PLAGUE!!!!!!!!  Though econ professors are known to be quite cold and boring, Professor Das was little more than a walking textbook.  Much like a textbook, she knew all the information and presented it accuarately, but did not help in the least to explain what the information actually meant.  Her examples were tedious.  They were more similar to mathematical proofs that were so scattered around the board that they seemed little more than numbers thrown about.  She is a very cold person, wants nothing to do with her students, and is not likely to ever speak to you directly.  She shows up to class late, rushes in all the information into one uncomprehendable lecture that goes too fast to even take down notes, and essentially ignores anyone who may be confused.

Professor Fox is one of the few people who have made my experience at Columbia memorable.  He is a fascinating man who bases his knowledge in the subject not only on his studies in classrooms, but on his field work in which he immersed himself in a different culture.  Professor Fox explains the theories of the relationship between music and language and then goes on to show real life examples through his research plus that of fellow colleagues.  Perhaps the most amazing thing about Prof. Fox though, is his relationship with his students.  I have never met a professor that is so open to random walk-ins in his office without prior appointment.  He is friendly with each student and is genuinely interested in the work that his students do.  To be honest, it sometimes feels as if he sees you less as a student and more as a peer.  He will go out of his way to find resources that a student may need for research, etc....  Class is never anything less than entertaining, though still informative.  Attendance is important, as there is no textbook, but he does offer a class webpage that contains the materials (papers, songs, etc....) used in the class.  If at all possible, TAKE A CLASS WITH PROFESSOR FOX!!!!!  It will be a class in your Columbia career that you will not forget.

Patterson is a very fun lecturer.  He mixes his class with poetry, stories, slides, songs, props, and so forth.  Notes are negligable as he passes out handouts that are nearly replicas of what he writes/draws on the board.  Don't be fooled by the entertainment of the class though.  When it comes to problem sets, midterm, and the final, you will see things that have never been presented in class save for a quick peek that is easy to overlook.

Professor Morton In my opinion, he is a boring professor. Lectures suck, and exams are tough. He is there to show students how much he knows, and how much he can trick students on exams. He even has an attitude that the author of the book does not know as much as he does. The way he speaks, the way he explains the stuff are confusing, and sometimes, it makes me wonder if he really knows what he's talking about.   I don't agree with other ppl saying he is a nice guy, a good looking and an intelligent guy. I think he is funny looking.  He is intelligent enough to be a professor, but no more than that.

I enjoyed this class. There's a lot of reading, but you don't really need most of it for the exams. If you already know a lot about Israel, you're not really going to learn many new things in this class, but it was nice to learn about the wars and about politics. It wasn't something I ever knew a lot about and I'm glad I took this class. Prof. Stanislawski isn't the best lecturer. He goes off on tangents and you start daydreaming, but sometimes the lectures are really interesting and he is a nice guy. He knows a lot about Israel and he will have an answer for whatever question you have for him in class or after class. I felt that this class was about 30% lecture, 70% recitation and I will probably remember my TA more than Prof. Stanislawski. The big focus of the class is the 15-20 page research paper which really was FUN. That was my favorite part of this class and you just learn so much more when you research a topic you are really interested in. It's important to start the paper EARLY because it's a lot of work and the TA's expect an amazing paper. You need to write a rough draft and the harder you work on that, the easier it will be for you to write your final draft. I'm very proud of the paper I wrote.
If you care about Israel and want a fun class with your fellow Jews (and a few non-Jews as well) take this class!!! If you're Jewish and aren't in this class, you will feel left out because like all of your friends are in this class. Well at least everyone from EC is in this class.

She SEEMS like a nice person for like the first week and she SEEMS like a good teacher for like the first week, but then, sadly, reality sets in and you find out that she is neither of those things. Pretty much the whole class hated her. We didn't learn ANYTHING all semester. We wasted about 3 weeks on this silly short story that's not even part of the syllabus and then when it was time for chapter quizes, she was like ""teach yourselves. there's no time."" Not only did she not teach us the grammar for this class, which is like 70% of the final, she refused to even review the grammar for the last 2 quizes we had. The first few quizes she gave us were very difficult and tested material we didn't even cover from the book. It was obvious how little spanish our class knew when everyone bombed the departmental midterm (which is the same for every class). I thought it was just very hard, but when I spoke to friends in other 1202 classes, they all told me they did well and that they found it east because- get this - their teacher actually TAUGHT them something! Unbelievable. Spanish used to be my favorite class and Isabel made it torture. She speaks super fast and swallows her words, and you can't understand a word she says. She kind of talks to herself too more than to the class so it's really difficult to have any sort of class discussion. The book for the class (El coronel) is difficult to read and she made us get into groups and answer questions about the book, instead of actually teaching us anything or having us discuss the book. The groupwork was such a waste of time, and before you knew it, class was over.
Usually when teachers don't teach, you can say, ""well at least they're nice."" But, not in this case. She got on everyone's case for being 3 minutes late to class because the clock in the class was 5 minutes fast so she considered everyone late and she kept lecturing us on not being late to her class. After hearing how evil we all were for being 3 minutes late to her class, I just loved how she showed up 10 minutes late to our final exam!!!!
In conclusion, avoid this one. Spanish is supposed to be a fun class and she just drains all the fun right out of it. She likes to hear herself speak, doesn't seem at all interested in teaching us, and tells us to teach ourselves. $3000 to teach myself Spanish and to undergo 50 minutes of torture 3 times a week?

OK.  This guy really does know his stuff.  However, because he's so into music theory and the philosophy behind the music, he changes Music Hum from an introductory survey course of western music history to an advanced music theory course.  This is great for those kids who already know all their stuff because of past experiences in music; they eat it up.  However, for those of us who have never taken a class like this before, it SUCKS.  To illustrate my point, he not only added extra reading, but an entire extra BOOK to our syllabus.  When I showed this book to people in several other music hum sections, none of them had ever even seen it or heard of it; all they ever had to read was the regular music hum text, which we had to read in addition to the other book.

She is aggressive with getting everyone in the class to participate, and encourages all of us to share little bits of our lives so all the students learn a lot about each other over the course of the semester.

This class was mind-numbingly boring, and Marwell's know-it-all attitude as well as the frequent fawning of a select few underclassmen over her ""expertise"" made for a pretty negative experience. I still can't understand why this class exists, let alone why it's a requirement for Soc majors -- in Imagination, the readings were very engaging, and Polletta was a very approachable and dynamic lecturer. Marwell seems only to know the biographies of the different authors down pat, and discourages any interpretation of the theories that do not wholly reflect her own. All in all, she's pretty intimidating, and going to class was more a chore than a pleasure. This was the one class that made me reconsider my Soc major; however, I'm sticking with it, confident that the rest of the department can't possibly be as overbearing and unpleasant regarding the use and application of the material.
Workload:
LOTS of reading -- don't bother with it, just go to the lectures and she'll tell you what she wants you to know. Each week you're given 3 questions relevant to the reading, and one is chosen each Wednesday as a quiz question. 12 quizzes, get to drop 2. Take home midterm of 3 essays that takes forever; be sure to use your notes from this class to write the essays or she'll choose to disagree with you and lower your grade. Regrades of midterms are structured so that your grade can be raised, lowered, or unchanged. The final was 3 hours of comparative essays; she told us there would be 3 when there were in fact 4. In other words, stay away from this class unless it's required, and if it is, then choose the other section.

Don't let the ""seminar"" title of the class fool you -- this class really isn't too serious.  Once a week, Spilerman breezes into class, lectures you for an hour or two (depending on whether or not he's made other plans for the second hour of class), throws some handouts at you that you can't keep, and tells you to do the reading because you'll be tested on it (even though he never discusses it in class). I was pretty frustrated with this class at first because his approach eluded me, but I found that if you go to every lecture and you do in fact complete all the readings, there's no way that you can do badly in this class. Spilerman is not the most wonderful lecturer in the world, and he repeats himself a lot, but he's a nice guy that doesn't care for term papers or class participation or anything else that cramps his very direct approach to this course. He comes in and tells you what you need to know -- and as long as you understand that the rich are getting richer and the poor poorer, as well as a few basic trends, then you'll do fine. At the first lecture, I felt that he tried to initimidate kids out of the class with his staunch emphasis on statistical knowledge as a course requirement -- all you really need to know is how to read a graph and do some simple arithmetic. As the core class for the Urban/Stratification path, this course is ideal if you're looking to do well with minimal effort relative  to other courses. All in all, not such a bad experience.
Workload:
You're handed a syllabus on the first day of class that doesn't have any specific date attached to the readings -- that's because Spilerman takes his time with these topics and let's you know where you should be as you go along. Buy all of the books on the list if you don't want to be hunting down reserve copies that are never there. DO THE READINGS, they are a great supplement to the lectures and will better prepare you for the tests; pay attention to more general concepts, as he will never ask anything too specific. There is a midterm and a final in this class; the midterm worth a third of your grade and the final two-thirds. It may seem pretty rough but he appears to curve quite generously and your grade will properly reflect whether or not you've been paying attention. You'll get an A if you go to every lecture and do the readings.

As a requirement for Sociology majors, this class is pretty painless because Serban is a nice guy who wants everyone to do well. His approach reflects the idea that everyone in the class is math-challenged, which results in a course with really clear objectives. He explains everything at length and with utmost clarity and maintains patience with students who are trying to make the material more difficult than it really is. He seemed frustrated at times only because attendance waned; you should go as often as you can because there are some things he teaches that are not adequately addressed in the book. I couldn't really say what Soc majors are supposed to take away from this class in terms of later application to Sociology but it's a very good way to acquaint oneself with simple statistical concepts. Serban makes the best of one of the more boring requirements for the major.

After so many dubious experiences with Core classes and poor teaching, Dr. Gebelein was a saving grace, and my favorite teacher at Columbia thus far. It surprised me to find that this was her first time teaching here because her approach is so casual and un-self-conscious. She has an amazing mastery of the material and would frequently supplement the topic at hand with antecdotes and alternative ways of considering the material. Her humor and charm did wonders for a course that could undoubtedly be taught in a less enthusiastic manner. Her passion for topics of Latin American identity and all its many facets were really inspiring and engaging, to the point where I looked forward to every class and did the readings with much enthusiasm. If you're taking Lat Hum and you get Dr. Gebelein, consider yourself lucky. She is really something else, and sets a wonderful example of what teaching should be here at Columbia.
Workload:
She assigns about 50 pages of reading for every class, it doesn't take too much time (especially in the last half of the course). Each student does one presentation, during every class, related to the current readin usually lasting an hour or more; the idea is to introduce the material and then come up with discussion questions to be addressed in groups and later discussed as a class. A midterm and a final that were actually fun -- there was the usual IDs and essays, but she would sometimes have you write dialogues of different historical figures about a certain topic that would encourage much creativity. One 7-10 page term paper on a topic of your choice pertinent to the course.

The only mind-blowing conclusion she ever came to was that class was over. While Marwell's approach is organized, her interpretations lack depth and bar any conclusions about the theoretical material outside of her myopic ideas. She'll tell you that you're wrong when in fact it is hard to err completely in a course like this, where the theory can be viewed in any number of ways. She claims that ""social theory will allow you to expand your mind in different ways"" while simultaneously lowering your grade or humiliating you in class if you even dare to think outside of her own ideas. She encourages participation by skirting questions asked of her and making other students answer them. It appeared to me she did this because she did not know the answers herself. She ""teaches"" with a false air of mastery over the material, she also needs to smile once in awhile. I have no clue why she was allowed to teach this course, it just goes to reinforce the fact that Columbia will let anyone teach regardless of their skill or merit as an instructor. I got nothing out of this course except a most unpleasant deja vu. This was like bizarro ""Sociological Imagination,"" opposite it in every way: boring, dry, and poorly taught. I did well in this class but I can't overlook the fact that I could have gotten more out of it had I not been subjected to Marwell. The TA, on the other hand, deserves the credit for making me care about the class and for actually knowing what he was talking about.

Professor Foley is a really nice lady who wants her students to love this material as much as she does. She has much to offer in the way of teaching, as she has made huge contributions to this area of Classics. The course material includes primary and secondary sources that play off each other nicely with the aim of presenting basic concepts as well as departures from those ideas. This is a very interesting course that is taught well and with a lot of enthusiasm. My only complaints would be that sometimes I was thrown off by her giggly demeanor when she'd discuss readings or concepts in detail; it was discouraging to realize that this grown woman couldn't talk about genitalia or other sexual  things without acting like she was 12. Also, in the fall semester when I took this class I had no idea what my grade was until the end of November. Graded assignments came heavily toward the end of the semester and were a bit overwhelming.

One short (5-8 page) paper, one long (7-10 page) paper, and a final with pre-prepared questions. She allows you to rewrite the first paper which would be more handy if she returned it to you before you're almost done with the second. You get a cheat sheet for the final that lets you bring any notes/quotes relevant to the exam questions which she provides about a week before the final. Each student must do presentations for 2 classes; basically, a small number do the readings and then come in with any questions about the topic. While a good idea, it didn't really do much to clarify the material, and lectures would have been much more useful.

Professor Lindquist is a really nice guy. Everyone says Statistics is a really easy class and an easy A but it is still tricky stuff, and Prof. Lindquist was very good at explaining everything in detail. Recitations are ""required"" but the only time people would go is when he would have quizzes in them, which was about every other week. There was also a problem set assigned every week consisting of problems out of the textbook. They weren't difficult but definitely time-consuming and tedious. Also, the first half of the semester was insanely easy and then the class became tricky practically overnight. Same thing with homework problems.

I thought I had brilliantly defeated Columbia's stupid science requirement by picking the jokiest joke class ever to fulfill it. I figured I would show up to class once in a while, take the tests, ace them easily, and maybe learn an interesting thing or two. Instead, the class turned out to be very hard, with tricky problem sets, and the hardest midterm I had ever taken. But really if I didn't have such unfair expectations for the class, I would have liked it much more. The topics of the class are varied and diverse. Professor Helfand covers topics from carbon dating and half-lifes to the effects of sunspots on radio waves. He is very clearly a brilliant man, and his lectures are entertaining, despite the speed with which he moves through topics and the tremendous knowledge he assumes we have (and which of course we do not). He seemed to be despondent about the class at the end, and even came out and said that he was disappointed that the class didn't seem to be having fun. But that's probably our own fault for reading the idiotic CULPA reviews that said this class was a joke. Ignore them, understand that there is work to be done in this class with no textbook to refer back to for exams, and that you will be entertained occasionally, and always challenged to think, and you will like the class just fine.

IG Chem with Professor Flynn will take you on an emotional rollercoaster ride.  You'll be happy at first, because you only need to take one semester of chemistry.  Then you will be terrified because you'll realize that this is chemistry different from anything you've seen before.  If you're brave, you'll stick with it.  You'll be confused, but pretty sure you understand things...well...sort of.  And then, you'll take your first test, which will almost certainly bring out all of that horror and despair deep in your chemistry soul.  Professor Flynn is a great teacher and really loves chemistry.  He just sometimes forgets that we are college freshmen and have not been working in the field for 60+ years.  His tests are HARD, and you will very rarely feel sure of yourself.
This class is most definitely not for people who lack a real (AP) Physics background, as a lot of the chem is based in ""basic"" physics concepts that I had never heard of before.  I probably would not recommend it for premeds, because there is very little real chemistry until a week before the final.  
Either way, it can't be denied that Professor Flynn is a great teacher.  He is one of the funniest (in that slap-your-forehead corny way), nicest professors you will ever have, but his tests will bring you to tears.

No one else exhibited such an infectious hunger to unlock history's hidden information. He is fascinated by the power of small changes and innovations to cause huge results... and now I am too. His lectures were not for everyone, because they were so anecdotal; but I felt more than willing to follow his streams of consciousness.

DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS.  I was very dissapointed and I am happy to see that there were some other people in this class who felt the same way that I did.  Overall, this class would be ok if the students were compensated with easy grading.  But having to endure this class and then being graded harshly was just too much for me to handle.  I turned in a draft for my first paper a week early and went to see her about it and she had forgotten to read it and then goes over it for 5 minutes when I come by for her office hours and then gives me a grade I thought was a lot lower than what I deserved.  I'm not trying to be a prick here, but I got an A- in LandR and have never gotten below a B on a paper, and I'm a junior so I've done the CC Lit Hum thing.  Lets just say that my grade on this paper was lower than a B.  And for my second paper I give her a draft.  I come by for office hours and not only has she not looked over it, she lost it.  I give her a second copy and we decide that we'll talk about it after the next class.  After the next class she sees me sitting there and starts rifling through her stuff and says she'll need a moment to find my paper.  So I go to the bathroom and get some water and when I come back she's reading it over for the first time.  And then she ends up giving me a low grade on it.  I feel like in this class the students put in a lot of effort to do well, and I don't feel one-tenth of that effort to help the student excel from her.  Overall, I feel like as a class we could have done what we did in class if she wasn't even there.  I'm pretty sure that she is a visiting professor and hopefully that visit is over and no one at Columbia ever has to read these to make a decision about a class.  I just can't imagine what is going on in her head when she is grading the student's work.  Could have stomached the class if the grading was easier.  I thought the material was very interesting, and that my classmates made a lot of interesting points.  But there was a little too much class discussion and not enough lecturing.

The title of this class is a bit misleading. Perhaps a more appropriate one would be ""Medieval Intellectual Life and how it Marginalizes Women"" since more than half the course is devoted to just this issue (silly me for thinking that Barnard could actually put feminism on the back burner and teach real history). I must say, however, that Professor Kaye is indeed a very adept lecturer who blends (and often bends) insights, literature, and factual historical information to his own interpretation of how great and underappreciated the middle ages really were. Yet while this is undoubtedly a great skill, he tried too much to compare the medieval period to the 21st century with an all too pessimistic tone that I did not feel was necessary or too relevant. Again, his delivery as a lecturer is admirable; but if you want an objective, nonbiased treatment of the medieval period that does not overly focus on the mistreatment of women or draw too many comparisons to show how little we have come along today in modern times, then I suggest you look elsewhere (perhaps a real Columbia class).

Professor Aguilar is quite unique. She is amazingly intelligent. She frequently, for instance, recites entire poems from memory when she is reminded of them by the class discussion.

She is, though, pretty interesting, so it's not too bad. The stories you read in class are generally good.

Prof. Golston is a really good teacher.  He was out in California teaching at Stanford, so he's definitly got a Califronia-guy vibe. He describes himself as a Dutch Socialist, doesnt take attendance, and seems mad that he has to put up with he called the Bolshevikish Bureaucracy of Lit Hum. He's really funny and very knowledgeable about English, even though its not his first language...Dont let that scare you, if he didn't tell you that on the first day of class you wouldn't know. His class is lots of fun, especially when he goes off topic, woah, its like, ride the Golston Train.....If you have the chance, take a Golston Class. Great Prof.

This class was a major disappointment. I took a years worth of psychology in high school and after reading reviews about this class i figured it wouldn't be that bad. Boy was I wrong. Galanter is a very boring lecturer and his tests are extremely unfair actually impossible. I have no idea how some people managed to score 105 on them. I did a fair amount of reading and attended almost all the lectures but once it came time to take the test I was lost. I knew everything there was to know about classical conditioning but I couldn't answer the questions on the test about it. This class is definately not an easy A or B.

Alright, so here's the deal.  Prof Hertz really is as organized as they say, the hour long class is jam packed with information and will have you frantically taking notes the whole time (dont worry though its still do-able),  and you'll carry the Campbell textbook around with you so much that it will in fact become an extension of your body. This class is most def hard work, but its fair.  My main beef with Hertz, however, was not with the class, he's definitely a great lecturer, but with his tests. His question style is so specific, that if you're not good at it, you're basically screwed for the class since your entire grade is based on three tests. Oh yeah, and Hertz is also totally unapproachable outside of class, and has a strange affinity for lizards. (I'm serious, go to his office and check out the lizard posters).

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! By far the worst class at Columbia. This class was so boring you'll loath the days that you have to attend to listen to his mind numbing rhetoric of rivisionist non-sense. The class highlights include a devoted cadre of front row occupying sychophants who hang onto every word from this tired relic of a person, constant mis-information and mistakes during his lectures, as well as backrow know-it-all's who constantly interupt Baldwin to interject  meaningless and irrelavant statements. The grading system in his class made no sense as well as the lack of feedback on the two assignments.  Overall you will LEARN NOTHING at all and if you do not know how to politically score a good grade (A.K.A. Grade Grub) you're toast. Baldwin wears the same unflattering outfit to class everyday. In his assignments he is looking for a regurgetation of ideas not original thought. Definately avoid this class and all classes taught by him.

By far the worst TA ever. If you see this women, run! Not only did she not offer any feedback on papers She is also the most parsimonious grader you will ever encounter during your academic career. And if you choose to take a class with her be prepared to battle for every meaningless, arbitrary point that she will begrudgingly give. Like a war hardened Soviet General Rosenthal will never budge an inch, no matter how much common sense she sacrifices. She was the worst TA I ever had the misfortune of meeting. When appealing a grade the chain of command should be avoided and the student is advised to go directly to the professor.

As a Lifelong Learner, I've already taken classes at Columbia  for over five years!  So I suspect I have a longer perspective than most undergraduates here - to say nothing of my four years at Yale and one at Harvard many years ago.
With that perspective, I can say unequivocally that Stanislawski is the best teacher I've  ever had.  Period! 
While the perspective of some Columbia  undergraduates may be different  - many  seem  more interested in grades and workload than pure learning - as an  LLL who has no interest other than learning for its own sake, I found Stanislawski to be a most knowledgeable, interesting,  drolly amusing lecturer.

Although Phoebe seems like she could be a cool person to hang out with on the weekends, she just didn't run a great Art Hum class.  She specializes in the earlier part of the semester, so by the time you get to Impressionism you are really not given that much help into understanding the works.  She definitely does know some important aspects of each piece of art, but her knowledge seemed to be very limited.  On top of that, grading could be harsh and paper guidelines were unclear.  I think Phoebe has the potential to be a good teacher someday, but she just isnÂ’t comfortable enough with teaching at the moment.

Eric is a really nice guy who likes to take his students on field trips to the Met and buys them lunch with the core office money. He also gives a pretty good introduction to art, sculpture, and architecture, which is really the point of art hum. However, if you're looking for an easy A, this is not it. The midterm and final required a lot of memorization (including dates to the nearest 10 years) and as far as I know, there was no curve at all. Also, the papers are graded very harshly: giving an overview of simple observations is not enough for him; he expects you to go above and beyond what you see to describe the painting or sculpture in formal terminology (which I felt was a bit too much for an intro level art class). Overall, a nice young grad student, but not as kind with the grading as he looks. In addition, participation is important, helps your grade, and generally makes you appreciate the works much more, so do yourself a favor and come up with some remarks or comments, even if they seem overly simple or stupid.
Workload:
Midterm, cumulative final, both of which have 90 second ID's and longer 10-20 minute comparative essays.

Well, I really have nothing more to add to the previous reviews, but since I have nothing better to do, I'll repeat what was already said about him. He is very knowledgeable about the material, and gives historical background information for every philosopher, which is a plus. He has this witty type of humor that takes some time to get used to and becomes very amusing in some rare instances. He also assigns a LOT of reading, often adding to the general syllabus. This sometimes helps provide transitions and support to the other works, but of course is often unbearable and difficult to actually finish. Also, he often ignores student questions in an attempt to get to everything on his little planner. Oh, and one more thing, if you're looking for an easy A, you'll be very disappointed. I did very well in the class, but only after putting in a superhuman amount of time and work , so much so that my performance in other classes often suffered (if that is any indication of the rigor of this class). Overall though, he's a good discussion leader and manages to cover the main points of the works. If you're the type of person who doesn't care about grades, want to learn a great deal and need to be pushed to work hard, Daniel is for you. Otherwise, your CC experience will be nothing short of root canal-type pain. (And the stuff about having only hypothetical questions on papers, midterm and final are completely true.)

I thought Amir was such a fabulous teacher that I'm still considering going to Susan Elmes, as the department head, and suggesting that his class be video-taped for the benefit of those professors who may be geniuses in their field but who, if they took it into their heads to describe the workings of a doorknob, would insure that at least half of the adult population would never be able to get through a door again (just about sums up the econ. department for me).
His lectures were not only clear, he not only kept up class participation in a way I would have thought almost impossible for a class with about 150 people, but he is just a plain good lecturer.  He has a real ""public-speaking style"" that actually acknowledges that he has an audience to keep interested.  If you hate it then I guess your in trouble but I really appreciated it. He speaks well, clearly, loudly enough and with as much humor as can be wrought out of accounting.  His lectures are well-organized powerpoint presentations and there are no surprises or long, wandering deviations.  He repeats information; not in an annoying but in a truly helpful ""I want to make sure you're all clear on this"" sort of way.  As to minding the ""Clear? Questions?"" I can only say that in many of many of my classes the level of lostness on the part of the students is palpable above the silence and their refusal to ask the professor what on earth s/he just meant, no matter how obscure the professor may have been.  But people felt more comfortable asking questions in Amir's class than just about any class I've taken.  He really wants to know where his students stand (once he has asked a question he will not continue until he has gotten an answer and if the class seems particularly recticent will cover the material again).  
And on top of it all, a fun accent.  I mean it, he's a good guy and a conscientious professor.

Professor Logan is a little hard to sum up.  At the beginning of the semester everyone in class seemed anxious about the upcoming term.  She spoke with an incredible lisp and clearly needed to see her gerontologist about some hearing aids.  She agreed with students when it was clear she hadn't even heard what they said, and corrected students for answers which were acutally right - she just hadn't heard them correctly.  To make matters worse, she was living in Philadelphia for the first half of the semester and ended up missing class several times due to the long commute.  Amazingly, though, only one student switched sections.  
By the middle of the semester, though, Professor Logan was easy to tolerate as long as you didn't take her corrections and hearing loss to personally.  She proved to be a very fair, if not easy, grader and gave a midterm that was not bad at all.  She even tried to make class more fun by taking us to a play in the Village and allowing us to write a review of it for extra-credit.  She constantly reminded us that puntcuality and attendance were mandatory, but she often forgot to take attendance or was late herself.

Contrary to other Professors in the dept. who are extremely impatient with those students who have not taken languages before, Prof. Paradi realizes this and will work with you.  I hope I can take another class with Prof. Paradi before I finish my language requirement. Take him if you can!!!!

Warning!!! By far the worst Professor I have ever encountered at this institution. He is an awful teacher and speaks a mix of spanish and Portuguese. If you do not have a great grasp of the language he shows no mercy.  He takes points off for every little mistake and missed accents. I mean come on some of us are just learning the language and trying to satisfy a requirement. He doesn't care and will take .25 off if  you forgot to dot your i's. I worked very hard in this class (as did many others) and he knew it, but disregarded this and gave many bad final grades to people.  I would never go within ten miles of this evil little man's class again.

She's horrible! I've never had such a terrible professor before. She never taught us anything. She expected us to know french and to say things naturally (I thought that it was her job to teach us this) So many people quit her class this semester, and if I knew better I would have too. Even when I asked her for explanations of grammatical things, she would just say that I should stop trying to learn it, and should just memorize it  and say it naturally ( i never got that). we never did any of the compositions, the tests were terrible cuz they're from the department and she didn't prepare us for it.

Professor Marwell can initially come off as intimidating, but stick around a while and you'll realize she's actually quite kind and funny.  This class challenged me to be concise in my work and to keep up with the material, however, the workload was not at all unreasonable and she was a very fair grader.  This class was not only insightful and engaging, but fun, too.  Daily presentations on the material helped to break up lectures, but lectures were lively and kept you on your toes.  Class participation is a must, but she really just wants you to say what's on your mind in a thoughtful and concise manner and exhibit that you have even the most elementary  understanding of the material.

Going to MieroopÂ’s class was somewhat like eating at John Jay. You donÂ’t really want to do it and can generally only feed on what youÂ’re given, but in the end you presumably get your basic vitamins and nutrition (even if it wasnÂ’t the most enjoyable experience). 
It was obvious that Mieroop wished he were fishing (or, more appropriately, digging up artifacts in Mesopotamia) instead of teaching the class. This made the class worthwhile because it was more laid back, you could afford to come a bit late, and class would often get out early. But life wasnÂ’t peachy: every class he would find some particularly unlucky soul in the class and call on someone to regurgitate some chapter or part of a plot, presumably what he viewed as Â‘engaging the classÂ’. A few times he would spice it up by calling on a few other random kids for more insightful comments. Otherwise the class was usually dictated by the direction he wanted to follow and what he wanted to talk about in the reading. At times, he would try to Â“involveÂ” students by asking them what they notice in a certain passage or excerpt (at which point the entire class falls into silence for half a minute and appears to read that passage). Then at the end of the class he often asks for questions, when some students might raise some issues. Whether it was the quality of the class or MieroopÂ’s flat and uninvolved responses to student inquiries, student discussion usually did not go greatly in depth. But it was not a torturous experience: Mieroop would talk about the general thematic elements or particular messages or facts he wanted to get across. In fact, if you value learning about the books in Lit Hum, then the class is perfectly enjoyable. But more troubling than his laid-back attitude (since it reaps as much good as bad) is his arbitrary grading. Sometimes it will make sense and seem fair, other times the format in which he grades is incomprehensible. His grading seems to involve a quick skimming of your work, and maybe a few interspersed (skin-deep) comments while leaving entire pages blank. Unless you get lucky with MieroopÂ’s grading, then it might very well leave you feeling upset if you put any thoughtful work into a paper / exam and wanted intelligent feedback. If you are desperate for a vivacious, constantly thoughtful, and engaging Lit Hum class, then skip MieroopÂ’s class. If youÂ’re satisfied with a laid-back, often mundane, though somewhat thoughtful class, then stay with it.

Brian Cole started the semester by telling us that we should not buy a textbook for his class because none of them are worth their price. Instead, he would made his lecture notes available online and print them out (when he had time which was about half of the lectures). Brian Cole also decided that because he was not using a textbook he would hold his own recitations. 
The lectures were at 9:15, but Brian Cole's skill as a lecturer was so strong that halfway through the semester I stopped drinking coffee before coming to class because he made physics so engaging. Many others decided not to come to lecture (maybe because it was at 9 or maybe because the notes were all online) - by the end probably only one-third of the 35-person class would come. Often the lectures would start 5 minutes late because he was late or because he was waiting for enough people (8-10). 
The class is heavy on the math - a lot of which is above the typical sophomore's level of knowledge. This class is for physics majors, if you're not interested in physics or maybe some applications of math, take 1403. The course definitely ups the ante from 1601/1602, but probably falls shy of the rigor of 2801/2802. They don't let physics majors slip through an introductory sequence without doing some mathematical physics. I thought it was much less painful to do it for one semester as a sophomore than for two as a freshman.
The math used includes complex variables (to more easily solve sin/cos differential equations and for the quantum mechanics), linear algebra (to solve coupled-oscillator problems - finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues), partial differential equations (to solve the wave equation). However, Brian Cole provides everything you need to know to do the physics. If you've taken these courses already, you're set; the problem solving won't be challenging and you'll develop intuition very quickly. I took linear algebra and partial differential equations concurrently and it helped tremendously.
Brian Cole told us he didn't like to talk about grades; he said we should focus on the material and if we learned it the grades would come. Basically, he's telling you to not bitch at him after the midterms and that he'll probably give you an A range grade if you are competent on the exams.
The class is pretty difficult. The problem sets take a lot of time, usually, because he uses them to teach extra material. Brian Cole makes himself very available for help, which you should definitely make use of. In the end, it's all about caring. If you care about physics, you'll spend the time doing the homework; if you care about learning how to solve the problems, Brian Cole will guide you through them. Brian Cole care about you - he spent hours writing his lecture notes and creating problem sets, and he expects you to care about learning, and consequently, to not grade-grub.
Brian Cole is not without fault, however. He can be slow to post homework problems and lecture notes, but will usually extend the deadline if he's late. He also does schedule extra lectures, to make up for days missed for exams or if he misses a lecture, sometimes on Friday (but we often had a problem set due on Friday, so it was already a wasted weekend day).  
If you think you're interested in physics, you should take this class. Even if you're unsure, Brian Cole could give you reason to like physics. I thought it would be my last physics class, but now I'll probably take more. If you're an engineer in need of the third semester of a physics track and don't want to work hard, take 1403.

The memorization so breezily cast off as simple has been misrepresented.  The second block of subject matter, between midterms uno and deuce, is commensurate in its enormity only with the human capacity for regret at not having just gone ahead and taken biology like a real student.  Those interested in anthropology and evolution in their own respective rights will be saddened at the boring, sprawling, going-through-the-motions mess of which they are made.  Those looking to be challenged will be met not with intellectual stimulation- for the lectures are deadening, the readings are repetitive, and the textbook is, well, silly- but with the drudgery of having to devote entirely too much attention to a class from which they will ultimately take nothing beyond vague memories of the significance of the positioning of the foramen magnum in the long, boring cline of the australopithecine.  
Those wishing to take the bull by the horns, the quiz every Monday, the eternal chafing of quiet despair- I offer you this advice:
The dropping of the lowest midterm grade means it's real easy to just get that 26 on the second exam.  As for studying for quizzes during lectures, it's not only efficient- it's the only way to pass them.

I am shocked to read so many negative reviews.  One reviewer assures readers that one mustn't read the course material.  Then why take the class?  Idiot.  Another accuses Marwell of a negative and bland teaching style; this is not the case.  She aptly and deftly explicated the theories of the three ""canonical"" social theorists.  ""Theory"" doesn't necessarily mean apply Marx to feminism, aesthetics, and media theory.  Keep in mind that this is an introductory class' as such, theories are to be grasped instead of to be utilized.
This class is relatively easy if you attend the lectures and do the reading.  The take-home midterm is not very time consuming (that's relative...it's about 10 pages when completed, and the questions are more than fair).  The final is graded with little scrutiny and may be finished in under 2 hours easily.  The quizes are also not extremely challenging, though they are very beneficial to achieving understanding of the material.
Big ups to Marwell.  If you don't like her, you (a) don't like social theory but claim to still like ""sociology,"" or (b) must be a pretentious asshole who namedrops in class and assumes greater self-knowledge than you actually have.

He is also extremely witty (even obscene and completely politically incorrect at times). However, the content of the course was too difficult. I am not a ComSci major, but this was even tough for someone majoring in the topic. He warned us that we should consider switching into 1004 if we didn't feel up to the challenge.

I would consider Prof. Lindquist the best professor I've ever had at Columbia if the subject were a bit more interesting.  Nonetheless, Martin was overall awesome.  The lectures were consistently detailed, thorough, and easy to follow.  The class is really not the difficult at all--that certainly helped.  But whenever something was tricky here and there, Martin was genuinely interested in making sure you understood.  He truly made me see that despite the arrogant crap you often find teaching at Columbia,  there are a few gems like him out there.  He's really enthusiastic both about the subject and about teaching, so you'll find that going to class isn't so bad.  But if felt like cutting, you're in luck because you can borrow notes from anyone in class and still understand perfectly: the man writes down every word he says.  Always ask questions in class because he'll keep explaining until you understand three times over.  If you have to take Statistics (and your major allows Stats A), Martin is your man!

Not too hard a class, but lots of 3rd-grade level nonsense.  The first 3/4 of the semester Sacks was off-task for at least the first half of the lecture passing out potential (volunteer) tutoring and teacher's aides jobs and snacks galore (even though she said that food was the worst reward to give to a class of students).  Sacks isn't mean, perse, but she has made nasty comments to many a classmate.  The individual projects could be either fun or a pain in the butt depending on what resources you had - she never informed many students that you cannot really go into NYC classrooms to conduct experiments.  Classroom observations (1 elementary, 1 secondary) were fine albeit time consuming and hard to schedule and the writeups were not bad if you know exactly what she's looking for.  Nevertheless, she thinks she's more influential in the NYC public school community and that we can get into classrooms with ease which was clearly not the case.  Also - if you want a good grade be sure to go to an All-Women's school - she seems to love that more than anything!  As far as the in-class ""seminars"" as she would call them - we ended up coloring, writing stuff out on newsprint paper, drawing with crayons, and talking about our ""personal experiences"" in 5th grade - half our life ago.  It seemed more like a therapy session than a psych class.  Also, the documents she hands out are rediculously outdated.  She plays favorites and is feminist (she thinks that girls are oppressed by boys in the classroom and therefore they should be separated; okay, well she does teach at Barnard).  But if you manage to go to class, sign the attendance sheet, dig out your feelings about that bully who pushed you in the mud at recess when you were nine, and eat some of her cookies, you'll get a good grade.

I had trouble sitting in the room assigned to him - but that was more because it was full (he loves the senior citizen auditors) rather than his teaching style.  He is able to lecture continuously - only taking one or two breaks to answer questions (for the love of your classmates - PLEASE save your questions for after class/ office hours) - and needs to use little to no A/V equipment.  Nevertheless, because he can go on and on it is difficult to take notes since if you miss a sentence you can be confused the entire lecture.  The reading list was pretty bad - and I really didn't like the Orwell book although everyone else said it was the ""peak"" of the reading list.  Sections could be either great or godawful depending on which TA you're assigned to.  The research paper is insightful and if you choose your own topic he'll read it himself (and give very kind feedback).

Nevertheless, the vast majority of the class did keep up with the reading (much more than LitHum last year) and so students took his criticism with insult.  He graded extremely tough on the papers, especially given that he would give us a week to work on them and give some ambiguous questions.  I guess he thought that giving low grades made him a good prof.  Instead, many classmates were turned off by this.  Midterm and finals had review sheets from which the questions were drawn from - but if you didn't study really hard you were screwed.  Also - participation is 25% so if your mouth wasn't running you had to have superb written work.  Not a bad guy, and accessible during office hours, but he was very harsh and didn't appreciate the fact that we had a really smart class.

You've gotta stay on point if you want to do well.  Reading's not too bad but make sure you UNDERSTAND every last word or else he'll think you didn't read.

I love professor Russell - and not because I am a groupie.  He knows his stuff and he is genuinely interested in what students have to say.  I was able to participate and have some interactions with him without being a groupie (this was the first class I took with him).  The class is challenging enough but not difficult (very light reading) and above all else, the material is so interesting it's hard to not look forward to his well-organized lectures.  Though are often loaded with terms and dates, you don't have to get everything down because he gives possible ID terms and essays for both midterm and final.  Professor Russell is a labor historian and teaches lots of pop and working-class culture.  He's not big on politics and usually only teaches them as background.  He is also big on primary texts, if that is your thing.  You read 3-4 every lecture - compiled in a coursepacket.  A good lecture to take if you want minimal commitment and maximal interesting material.

DO NOT TAKE ANY CLASS WITH JUDITH RUSSELL. I have read the other reviews that say she is brilliant and although I do not think she is, that is not the issue. She is simply the worst professor I have ever had here at Columbia. Her lectures are so unorganized that it is never clear what points she is trying to make. She literally cannot finish a sentence without injecting 5 or 6 ums into it so that  it is incomprehensible if she ever does finish it. She is didactic, extremely condescending, and not pleasant to listen to at all, especially when she berates the ladies in the class for not raising their hands enough and threatens to give out pop quizzes (as if we are still in high school). And to top it all off, she micromanages your life to the point where she takes attendance for a 9 am class (even my high school teachers didn't take attendance).  The only good part about this class were the TA's, they were friendly and always willing to help decipher her messy and incomprehendable lectures.

Take this class! Professor DaPrato is a great guy and a wonderful professor. His classes go by quickly and are really interesting and amusing. But more importantly, this is the most useful class you will ever take at Columbia. The skills that he teaches you will be invaluable for your future, whatever career you choose. He will teach you to not only be a great public speaker, but how to organize your thoughts clearly for other people, how to persuade and influence others through logical reasoning, how to present yourself, and how to impress anyone you come across (especially useful for job interviews). He is easy to talk to and will always take time outside of class to help you with your speeches or answer any questions you may have.

While Prof. Davidson may be full of knowledge and conviction, and on top of it all an up and coming novelist, she doesnÂ’t have much of a concept of class discussion. YouÂ’ll be doing postings to Courseworks every week about a completely random topic from the reading, and theyÂ’ll never be mentioned in class Â– wtf, just write a few questions that would impress a high school teacher trying to lecture about the Odyssey and youÂ’ll be fine.

I think sheÂ’s a really smart person, and if thatÂ’s youÂ’re style of learning, more power to you. I couldnÂ’t take Prof. Davidson second semester because of a conflict, and my LitHum2 teacher was infinitely worse.

Look, pre-meds, Flynn is easier than regular Gen Chem! You actually donÂ’t have to deal with those frustrating lecturers, you can have fair exams and actually learn something with one of the highest regarded chemistry profs in the US. He is rather boring, and the lecture hall doesnÂ’t really fill up, but he does throw in a few viable jokes now and then. IÂ’d like to disagree with some of the reviews below, and say that the powerpoint presentations are actually quite helpful Â– though youÂ’re right, it is better to go to class first to see how he treats each piece of material. He curved slightly lower than a B+ this past year, but an A- is easily within your reach if you do every HW problem and study all the lectures Â– the first, and maybe even also the second problem of four on the tests are straight out of the text! Recitations are rather tedious, so make sure you prepare for them so you donÂ’t waste time during the session figuring it out. His challenge problems, always involving the excitation of molecules by light, may look intimidating, but if you are patient and try to figure them out, youÂ’ll go a long way with them, and be on your way to an A.

She is friendly, and naturally entertaining Â– calls herself a Â“space cadetÂ” for being a little bit inept in administrative issues, but this isnÂ’t really true Â– sheÂ’s fine.

I donÂ’t even know if she realizes how odd it sounds, but itÂ’s certainly hilarious. The only issue I had with work in this class is that she loves to give long problem sets at the worst times Â– and an exam covering four chapters that she doesnÂ’t really go over well in class, right after Thanksgiving break! We tried to get the exam moved, but it didnÂ’t go through because a few people had issues. She talks a lot in class about what goes on in her laboratory Â– mainly research on new protein syntheses. The last exam question is often something on this subject Â– and if not, the second half of the exam is all thought questions of some sort. Premeds, save yourselves the heartache, and the grade, and take Katz. Nobody should even consider Cornish unless Orgo was your childhood hobby. The means on tests are always in the 60Â’s. You achieve the mean by knowing the obvious stuff Â– even a cursory glance at the material earns a mean grade. Additional study is likely to be useless, unless you decide to order and read every issue of Nature magazine ever published Â– this is where her exam challenge questions come from.

Thank god, finally I get something back for my tuition. Prof. P is scintillating, energetic, innovative, and stimulating.

Even if you donÂ’t have much prepared on whatever topic he jumps to (not always directly related to the text), paying attention during class will help you stay part of the discussion Â– you really have to be quite a drone to not appreciate Prof. PÂ’s passion for the subject.

He is the borne assassin of every aspiring doctor at Columbia, and if youÂ’re looking for a way out, youÂ’re wasting a lot of time that you should be using starting hacking away at the material 3 weeks in advance, in preparation to do 15 endless problem sets, read two brutally esoteric textbooks, study 30 hours a week for the exams doing diagrams, reworking problems, trying to keep youÂ’re head screwed on, and then reciting every prayer youÂ’ve ever heard in hopes of hitting the mean on the tests. If he teaches you biology, you should offer to give him computer lessons Â– he wastes an incredible of time on the computer setup of his presentations. HeÂ’s a bit rude as well, and if heÂ’s your exam proctor, heÂ’ll come out as a modern Gestapo, and not too receptive to student questions. I call this class Â“natural selectionÂ” for people whoÂ’ve been at it all their lives. I didnÂ’t take AP bio, and I really regret it now. You think youÂ’ve got the stuff nailed to the wall, until itÂ’s time to put the answer key away. YouÂ’ll have to break out of the traditional mold of studying a tough subject Â– get rid of the flash cards, vocab sheets, and quit quizzing each other, and devote youÂ’re life to knowing every possible situation (the problem sets will give you an intimidating start) where each little detail can even be mentioned. And itÂ’s not enough to have done the problems Â– the exams test whether or not the stuff is second nature to you, so just get going nowÂ…you can never know it too well Â– and no detail in anything you read can be passed off Â– in fact, the more ridiculous it sounds, the more likely it is to show up on the test. Even try to use the stuff in youÂ’re everyday thinking now and then Â– test yourself while you work out and see if you can remember exactly whatÂ’s happening in your body!

I went to office hours once and Sethi was most unhelpful and unapproachable. That deterred me from going again because although polite, he was cold and it seemed to be a task for him to answer my questions.  Although his lectures are well-organized, he speaks too quickly and wastes valuable time answering questions from students that do not effect the rest of the class and as a result, rushes through the second half of the lecture.

In his defense, Professor Berghahn is one of the nicest people I have ever met. He's always got a smile on his face, is fairly flexible with deadlines, and made himself available for discussions outside of class. 
However, the class itself disappointed. He tended to spend the first third of each lecture recapping the previous lecture, almost as if he were encouraging you to skip every other class. Worse still, the course amounted to nothing more than a rambling survey of early 20th century history. One day he'll spend a third of the lecture going on a tangent about railroads and standardized time, another day he'll devote the entire class to Nazi racist policies.

Professor Boerger is a great professor. She constantly stops lectures to make sure you understand what she has gone through. She has a great passion for music and it is this passion which makes what to me is a boring subject..actually quite interesting. 
Word of advice. Dont cram for the listening quizzes. Make sure you use good grammar on the papers...and do attend the review section she holds for the final (even if you're lost throughout the entire semester--all you really have to do is go to those 2 sections and memorize). She is not out to trick you, she is very helpful in helping you get a good grade, handing out the listening quiz study sheet well in advance. Moreover, unlike many professors, she is very accessible. She really wants you to learn, take advantage of it.

Hmmm..what can I tell you that you haven't already heard? True--this is not the best class ever but it is not the worst. If you have no prior knowledge of foreign policy, you'll learn the essentials. You might be able to learn a couple of other things from Baldwin's lecture, but they're not too insightful. 
The good news: you dont have to go to class or the TA sections. Read the articles in the books (preferably right after he assigns the paper)...mention the authors and their ideas..present a balanced argument, and your'e set. As for the other books--well just look at the chapter reviews and skim.

Its hard to kick Professor Sanchez down when he is such a nice guy. He cares a lot about his subject--but I must agree with the other 2 reviewers in that he seems to get lost in his lectures and ends up repeating the same thing over and over again. 
The readings: not neccessary. You can do EXCELLENTLY with minimal skimming of the index. For the papers simply reiterate one of the many things he has continously drilled..buffer up your paper with lots of jargon and you'll do fine. I actually dont know why everyone has complained about his grading system. the questions are fairly easy and dont require much thought Beware on the final though..as we did not get through the syllabus and he does not get through his lectures..you will need imagination. 
hmm what else? Oh if you are one to hand in papers late or one that needs extensions avoid this man. He has a ""strict"" late policy--he reduces you grade by one letter grade if it is late. RIDICULOUS. Trust me..you are better off handing it in on time as it is graded easily anyway.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS.  Despite having attended every class, reading the entire book and completing every  so called ""comprehensive study guide"", I still managed to received the lowest grade I have ever received in my two years here.  Prof. Hart's explainations are unclear and he expects the students to memorize useless facts (such as;' Between which two countries was the Opium War?' I mean, is this a history class or  a psychology class???)  If you enjoy memorizing text books, have fun in this class but make sure to attend every lecture.  The annoying daily quizzes basically have no impact on your final grade and have turned out to be a huge waste of time.

I really enjoyed this class.  Although many of the lectures seemed to be directed at 5 year olds, attending class proved very enjoyable and interesting.  The most annoying thing about the class was (hands down) all the arrogant Columbia students who tried to disprove every theory Nim discussed.  I'm sorry to say that a theory is not fact and many of them seem illogical and can likely be argued, which makes them theories.  I took the lab also.  Because it was Nim's first semester as lecturer, the lab was slightly disorganized and instructions to assignments were often given, after the assignment was due.  Also, Fabiana (lab instructor) was moody and you never knew what you were in for when you entered the very long 3 hour lab.  Despite all this, and a not sooo great grade (but not terrible), I loved the class and would recommend the class to anyone.

I was really surprised by those last two reviews - they honestly seem to be describing a different person.

I felt a duty to post something because I disagreed with most of the other reviews. I think that first one is too harsh: Prof. Regan does know her stuff, she is smart and has good tastes (I think). I thought the syllabus was well put together, even for ""serious"" film students. However, I agree that she does not know how to lead a discussion - partly this was the class' fault, but I think Marie could have done a lot better. I hardly ever gained real insight from the tedious discussions, and she rarely responded to student comments. They would go something like: ""that first scene had lots of close-ups."" ""yes."" ""that part had colorful costumes."" ""okay."" Also, the first paper was basically a test to see if we could spit out all the terms she'd written up on the board; it required no analytic effort. I know a lot of people had qualms with her grading, which was sometimes unreasonable and definitely inconsistent (and I have never complained about grading before at Columbia). Further, she missed the last few classes and the discussions were led by the TA and a guest lecturer. I had thought the discussions couldn't get any worse, but I was wrong - it was completely ridiculous. And to top it all off, she failed to bring the class evaluations on the last day. All in all, I can imagine worse, but a lot of things about this class annoyed me, and I would avoid it with Prof. Regan if possible.

While I thoroughly enjoyed this class, it definitely has some frustrating moments.  We study different ""units"", starting with feminism in Jewish religion/ritual, moving through to Sephardi women and women in the Shtetls, to women in the Holocaust, and finally women in Israel.  The reading can be pretty heavy at times, but most of it is extremely enjoyable if you have an interest in the topic.  However, barely anyone in the class finished all the reading.  She keeps grading fairly arbitrary, and its hard to know how you're doing in the class until you get your final grade.  Also, Prof. Klepfisz has an English background, so literary analysis is a part of the class.

Professor Adamek asked for ""no personal attacks"" on our professor evaluations, but unfortunately the bad points of this class have to do with her.  She's actually a really nice person, its not her fault.  As a previous reviewer said, she warns you on the first day of class that she is a boring prof.  I, along with many others, figured she was trying to scare off the wimps.  But no, this really was the most boring class I have taken at Columbia.  Prof. Adamek has this soothing, soft-spoken quality to her voice that honestly puts you to sleep.  REally.  I had never fallen asleep in class, before this one.  Additionally, her lectures lack structure and the handouts don't help.  While studying for the final, I realized how interesting much of the material really is, but throughout the semester I found it hard to motivate myself to do much of the reading because her lectures made me associate ""Asian Religion"" with ""Boredom"".  The primary sources are great.  TA's are a good resource.  Ironically, Columbia has removed this class from the possible courses to fulfill the MC requirement.  Good call.

Professor Wright is indeed a charming woman (despite, or maybe because of, her age) who is extremely knowledgeable in African history and culture. Overall, that is why taking African Civ with her so a pretty good experience. However, there are a few logistical complaints that I wanted to mention.  First of all, the midterm and final were quite fair content-wise (she even told us half of what would be on the final) but for me, they always took a lot of time and had too many parts. The final, for example, involved three pretty substantial essays along with a lot of ID's, and we only had 2 hours to complete it, which makes up for a feverish exam period. Another thing that got a bit on my nerves (and kind of hurt my grade) was the lack of direction she gave for the papers, especially the longer one. We could write on any topic in African history and culture in conjuction with her permission, which is a lot of freedom. But this is not necessarily good, because she was often very picky with the grades and comments, often punishing students for omitting something when this was really the result of her misdirection. Unlike some other people, I actually found the visual hour component to be the best part of the class, since we got to watch cool movies and documentaries in numerous African issues. (The evening timing of the visual hour, was on the other hand, a bit burdensome.) Oh, and one more thing: if you're the quiet type, then forget about taking this class because she often picks on the silent kids and participation is like 20-25% of your grade. In general, she is a nice teacher and this is a fun class (if you're interested in the material), just so long as you know what you're getting yourself into.

The class also jumps around from chapter to chapter which makes just reading the book difficult as well.  The 20 question m/c exams are pretty straightforward and come from the practice tests.

Time flies by because class is really fun and relaxed (you can eat, call out, etc.). He also sometimes shows cool movies, but only if you bug him a lot. 
El-Hage is great at knowing what non-Arabic speakers can realistically know and learn, and although he is fond of teaching us useful words that are not in the book, they will almost never show up on the quiz, so don't stress out if he's throwing words at you. El-Hage is very professional, and one of  the first MEALAC professsors I've had that does not let his political views seep into class discussion. El Hage most of all loves Arabic and teaching Arabic, and can explain the often beautiful etymologies of certain words. He is also a wonderful poet in both Arabic and English, and began publishing his poetry at age 17!  If you're starting Arabic, both Taoufik and El- Hage are great options. The rest of the Arabic teachers are not worth your tuition.

This was the worst class I've taken at Columbia. Prof Tong teaches the first semester, which is boring at best, and gives  a 45 multiple choice question midterm that tests you on completely obscure details from Gen Chem.  Then Prof. Zubay takes over and it goes even further downhill from there. He is cranky and condescending on a good day. He has no desire to help his students learn anything and only wishes to talk about how brilliant he thinks he is, how other people are idiots, and how many Biochem books he's written. I'm a Biochem major, so I love the material, and yet I still hated this class. It  was clearly impossible to demonstrate any  understanding of the material on the exams, as they were multiple choice, and consequently the standard deviation around the mean was about two.  I did well in the end, but that's because I studied the tiny details of the material like a madman. 
In hindsight I learned quite a bit in this class, but it was from trying to decipher  Zubay's coursebooks a million times on my  own, which proved to be difficult given the nonsequitor page layout and the interesting grammer. 
Steer clear of this class if it's not  a requirement. Don't take as an elective if you're a Bio major.

This is a good class if you liked the second semester of C2006. It's the same layout of lectures and problem sets. However, for some reason this semester Dr. Gibber was extremely disorganized for the lectures so a lot of time was spent waiting for her to remember what to say on each slide. 
The grading on the five miniexams was retarded to say the least. You get five points taken off if you do not describe a term in detail that most would consider very basic.  A word of advice on the exams: to avoid arbitrary points being taken off everywhere, explain everything that has to do with the subject she's asking about. Don't limit yourself to a coherent and inductive explanation. Go into every minute detail of every process or points will be taken off inexplicably. 
Overall I really liked the content of this class, as all premeds do, but the administrative aspect of this course was awful.  Dr. Gibber is funny, but her jokes lose their charm through the semester as your exams are handed back three weeks after you take them.
Workload:
Not so bad. Five mini-exams (which are like 1-2 pages of a C2006 test), five writing assignments (which are basically busy work but count for more than you think), and a cumulative final.

I have to say I honestly hated this class.  Though everyone told me CC would be better than LitHum, when you're coming from Tom Dale Keever's section (this guy is a gem for LitHum), Mckeown just doesn't compare.  He seems very nice and laid back initially, and I guess he is nice and relaxed, but bottom line is that he doesn't know his stuff.  He comes into class with a small sheet of notes prepared and begins lecture on whatever topic.  If the class went off on a different but still worthwhile topic, he would immediately end that discussion and bring the class back to his sheet of notes.  He's not very good at answering the class's questions, and I felt that at times he was rude with his responses.  Though many of my friends' sections spent 2 or even 3 class periods on Locke, McKeown didn't touch it (like, basically, removed it from the syllabus) because ""I don't really understand Locke.  I just don't get him.""- that was his response to someone asking why we weren't reading it.  As another reviewer said, he does role play, and it takes all your efforts not to burst out laughing during his little scene.  I think there were 2 scheduled debate days, where kids were assigned to teams and had to go along with his role playing bits.  The same kids spoke in class most of the time.  You don't really have to say anything if you don't want to.  Class always started and ended 10 minutes late.  Toward the end of the semester, fewer and fewer students came to class.
Workload:
light compared to other sections (which is why only half of my class switched out after the first semester)- the reading is doable and necessary to say anything worthwhile in class.  Weekly online responses (not too bad) which varied greatly in length and quality from student to student.  only 2 papers, each about 6-7 pages- topics are ok, not great.  papers graded very harshly, and comments not that helpful.  it helps a lot to go see him while writing a paper and see if he agrees with what you're saying (because he grades on what he likes).  midterm and final were easy id's and lots of essay writing.

Monica is great.  She is very energetic in class and always lets the students have fun.  She jokes around with us and relates well to the class because she's young.  Every day, we would usually work from the book, going over grammar, and do some handouts all together.  If she couldn't answer a question, she would go home and figure out the answer and let you know next class.  She is active in the hispanic academic world in nyc and let come with her to nyu to a poetry reading that she worked on with a famous poetry translator.  Grading was consistent, though the ability level from student to student varied greatly, meaning grades did too.  She is negotiable on deadlines and stuff like that.

I have mixed feelings about this class.  The lectures were very organized; Martin went point by point through the text book chapters, writing out every little thing on the board.  He went over certain points probably 10-40 xs, which is great if you are confused, but if you're understanding everything, his repetition gets tedious.  He graciously takes questions during lecture but can't always answer them sufficiently.  Homeworks got progressively a little longer and harder as the semester wore on.  My TA could hardly speak English, which made recitations a bit frustrating.  Many kids only went to recitations when we had our quizzes.  Martin does his best to make the class entertaining, and he really is a cute little man, but it's still hard to get yourself to go to lecture twice a week.  Missing a lecture isn't a big deal, but missing all of them would mean a lot more studying to do around midterms and finals.  A good percent of the class came to every lecture.  Martin doesn't make himself that available outside of class and wants students to instead consult their non-english speaking TA's.  This review is sounding pretty negative, but I didn't dislike the course that much, and I took it for interest.  If it's a requirement for you, Martin is a good choice.  If you're taking it for interest, you might wanna look for something a little more lively.

I studied a lot for the midterm and final and thought they were both reasonably easy (a few tricky multiple choice questions).

  Prof. Millis is one of the worst profs that I have ever had.  In class he frequently makes mistakes on the board.  I couldn't even use my notes to study for the final exam because they were so full of mistakes!  He also has an awful habit of erasing equations immediately after writing them.  You would think that the obvious distress of the class when he does this would be enough to make him stop, but he keeps right on doing it.  He also has a habit of using notation different from the book which is confusing.  The homeworks are incredibly long, but don't try to start on them too early because half the time they are full of mistakes that he corrects by email.  Each homework includes an incredibly worthless Mathematica section that takes hours and doesn't help you learn the material at all.

An appropriate subtitle for the course name might be ""David Dinkins and Friends.""  Each lecture, he invites 2-4 guest speakers to talk about a topic: education, health care, homelessness, budget, etc.  He starts the lecture off by reading, from typed notes, a paragraph or so about the topic, then proceeds to read the bios of the speakers.  Sometimes he has more to say, but not always.  The list of speakers is impressive.  Many are his former associates, and several are still in public service.  The lectures rarely go into great depth about any one topic; it's more a survey course about ""critical issues.""  However, it's definitely fascinating listening to the perspectives of authorities-- for examples, about crime from Ray Kelly, or about education from Joel Klein.
Expect lots of anecdotes, several pet stories of Dinkins retold over and over, and lecutures that won't put you to sleep.  Sometimes, unfortunately, those currently in public office will feed you the official organizational spin on an issue, but at other times they can be surprisingly candid.  Since many of these people are friends and former hires of David Dinkins, there is also quite a bit of effusive praise for the former mayor.  A Q&A session at the end of each lecture, but don't be timid or you'll find yourself listening to long-winded, overzealous, stuck up grad students who think too much of themselves.

Professor Billows is an excellent professor who is quite familiar with the material-- I believe he said he's been teaching CC for 17 years.  He only teaches the first semester, so expect a mystery professor for second semester.
Lectures are opened with history lessons, all which are pertinent and interesting, if you can bear to listen.  See, he talks in this kind of monotonous drone with a British accent, which makes you a bit sleepy.  It doesn't help that he rocks back and forth in his chair the whole two hours, lulling you with this rhythmic motion.  But he has good stuff to say, can rescue floundering discussions, and always makes excellent points about the readings.  Discussions sometimes go off on tangents, but he seems fine with it as long as it's something everyone is interested in discussing.  You'll come away with a good understanding of the works.
He brings up 'controversial' issues regarding the Bible, so if this is sacriligious and insulting to you, don't take the class and get your underwear all bunched up.  Come to class with an open mind and willingness to talk, and you'll have a rewarding experience.

Bruce Preston may not be the most interesting lecturer, but he is definitely competent.  He is very organized-- his lectures are on powerpoint, and cover all the topics succinctly.  The only problem is, they also parrot the textbook, which does not toot my whistle.  If you are the type of student that learns in lectures, this is an excellent course.  If you prefer to learn from the book regardless of what lecture is like, take this course, you won't miss anything.  If you like your lectures to cover supplementary or slightly different material from the textbook, prepare to be disappointed.
It must be noted that Bruce is a newly-minted professor straight out of Princeton, so his teaching style has not matured yet.  He even seemed rather hurt when class attendance dropped precipitously a few weeks into the course.  He does make the effort to try hard, though, and does a pretty good job.

Todd certainly puts a lot of time in preparation.  However, lectures do get a bit boring, and are condusive for sleep.  Each lecture, you walk in and take a slide list, and then the lights go off.  What happens when the room is dark?  Students naturally want to sleep, of course!  Then he starts talking about his slides.  What he has to say is certainly interesting and relevant, and perhaps even fascinating.  But he has this kind of unenthusiastic way of talking that makes you fall asleep, which is rather unfortunate.
The class is structured so you have lecture on Tuesday and discussion section on Thursday (or Mon/Wed), where the class is split into three sections.  They're quite boring, since many people don't feel like talking, and the discussion leaders don't seem to be particularly good at leading discussion.  You'll have to present readings a few times and lead discussions.  It's a great situation if you love to hear your own voice, but don't expect animated feedback.

The above review is pretty much right-on describing Taylor's character, but I still have to reccomend this class.  You're just not going to find material like this from anyone else at Columbia, except in a few Art History grad seminars.

He may be resistant to other interpretations, but you're not going to get ahead of him without spending 20 years immersed in these texts.

But the class is still really intresting and she opens it up to discussion many times. And again, you'll learn so much. Oh, and she gives you the final before hand so its uber easy but very long.

It's generally not a difficult class and it's heavily curved, which makes up for the sometimes challenging problem sets.

This is my 3rd class with Prof. Hamilton. I had perviously taken: intro to poetry writing, and poetics. Prof. Hamilton is simply incredible. she is passionate about poetry, and passionate about interests that students bring up. She respects her students. and most importantly instills respect for the material she presents. I would recommend this class or any class with Saskia Hamilton to anyone with even a mild interest in Poetry. The work is not hard, and there isn't a lot of it. It is fairly easy to get a B or an A, as long as you write coherent papers. The class can be frustrating because though you learn facts about poetry and poets and poems the field itself and prof hamilton's approach to poetry is subjective. At times you feel as if you have learned little, but you learn things that are almost more important - how to approach literature and deconstruct it, how to make connections within works and between authors. She's exteremly approachable. And if I could I would take more classes with her - unfortunately thus far I can only take one more with her: advanced poetry writing. take this class and don't be confused by her quiet and humble nature she's brilliant.

This class is one of the only English classes at Columbia where you can practice your writing.  Professor Shapiro expects you to put your heart and soul into each review that you write, and this takes a lot of effort. But it's worth it.  You will learn how to read and write book reviews. The syllabus is unique and interesting. Shapiro is loads of fun and knows how to keep a class entertained- there is never a dull moment.  He is a bit self-important and thinks his role as an academic is just as important as a doctor who saves millions of lives- but as long as you don't mind a bit of professorial arrogance, he is a very smart man with a lot to offer. He seems to care about his students and is willing to listen to them. This was one of my favorite classes at Columbia!

Difficult! 3 book reviews (which take hours upon hours to write- he wants only the best) and tons of reading.  Each week, you have to read the New York Times Book Review, London Review of Books, Times Literary Supplement, and New York Review of Books.

Professor Denison leads all her classes as if they are small seminars regardless of the number of students in the class.  As such,  the quality of her classes can depend on the intelligence of the students in it.  Although she rarely lectures, she is very pleasant to listen to and always has a smile on her face. She runs a very laid-back class and is understanding of any extensions a student may need.  The syllabus for this class is wonderful (Ibsen, Chekhov, Wilde, Shaw) but is heavy on the Victorian side with little of the more modern works.  If you like a chill atmosphere and and don't mind Denison consistently coming 20 minutes late to every class, take her!

Washburne is highly overrated.  While it's amusing to have a professor throw ""cool"" words into his lectures, his simplisitic understanding of the history of the Caribbean is painful.  Washburne makes highly generalized statements without any accurate historical information to back them up.  Granted, he is passionate about music (go hear him at Smoke- he's wonderful)  but passion can only keep a student interested for so long.  Unlike other classes at Columbia, which sometimes have an overly academic feel to them, there is no scholarly element to this class at all. I learned close to nothing and was also bored.

Abigail is that rare core professor with the enthusiasm and excitement that cross the line from an acceptable core experience to a thoroughly enjoyable one. It was her first semester teaching art hum, but Abigail met the challenge with ease and good humor, prepared her lectures in an engaging manner and got past standard setbacks like falling behind schedule with ease. At the beginning her inclusion of class members in discussions got to be slightly excessive, but leveled out and increased the intellectual stimulation a considerable amount later on. Her lectures on modernism and Picasso were outstanding, and caused at least one student to hopefully pursue more art history classes at some point in the future.

Matthew Miller is a wonderfully sincere man who is willing to try as hard as he needs to when it comes to keeping the students sane while teaching all of ancient and medieval philsosophy in three months. He is open to suggestions about what aspects of each book the students want to discuss, does not believe there is any  one universal truth, and is very clear about what he wants you to take from each text. He has a lot of background in philosophy and is very willing to take class discussions further and deeper if you're interested, very flexible with office hours even if you're taking time away from his research time for his own dissertation! The paper topics are not vague and easy to get around, he expects a substantial amount of thinking but is extremely helpful if you go and talk to him about your ideas. I always enjoyed writing the papers because the topics allow you to expand your own ideas and read a particular text a lot deeper so that you come out feeling like you truly understand what the text is trying to say, atleast in the one chapter that you choose to focus on...which is relatively fulfilling considering the speed at which we're expected to read and comprehend all the texts. Oh, and he has a wonderfully sardonic sense of humor that most of the students won't really get, but his random bouts of german are definitely part of the experience. he also home-cooked us very good food for a review session, so all in all, a really great person on the whole and a very interesting person to learn from.

Like the other reviewers have stated DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS WITH PROFESSOR RUSSELL!  She was the worst professor I have taken a class with at columbia.

Some reviewers have complained about the format of his tests, but Carnes makes available all midterms and finals from the past 10 years which are extremely similair to the test he gives, which makes the tests a lot less difficult.

I definitely don't think Prof. Andriopoulos is the best Lit Hum teacher, but I'm sure he is not the worst. I didn't think he chose the best topics for discussion in class. The books are fairly interesting, but he often seemed to focus on uninteresting parts of the books. He was also a little harsh on students' in-class comments--he rarely agreed with what was said by students in the class, and when he did agree, it was often with some of the more silly comments. I also found his grading to be a little unfair. He finds many sentences ""awkward,"" even when they are perfectly acceptable. He is harsh in his comments, but not too bad with the actual grade.
With all this being said, Prof. Andriopoulos is a pretty good Lit Hum teacher. He knows the material very well. Although his class can be boring, he is always willing to have students participate. As the previous reviewer said, he is also a very nice guy.

Pretty normal for Lit Hum. He only added ""Exodus"" to the syllabus. 2 papers (5 pages each), midterm, and standard Lit Hum final.

The other 2 reviews about Prof. Cody are pretty accurate. He is not a terrible professor, and for the most part he knows his stuff, however he is completely uninterested in teaching the course (and he doesn't hesitate to express these feelings to the class). This lack of interest is often manifested in his weak preparation. He is very hard to follow when he gives notes, because he is very ""jumpy""--always going from one topic to another. He is an interesting lecturer, though. He does sometimes just take his notes from an online music encyclopedia, but he expands on those notes to tell interesting stories. I didn't feel like I learned much music theory, because Prof. Cody often taught above my knowledge...he never really went over the basics. Luckily, though, he didn't require that we all understand the music theory.
Like the other reviewers said, he is a pretty easy grader, and he is a nice guy (although he never took the time to learn the names of the students in the class). I'm sure you could find a better (and more dedicated) music hum teacher, but I'm sure you could find worse ones.

Prof. May is, as other reviewers have stated, the cute, grandmotherly type.

Obviously, Prof. Helfand is a much-loved, well-respected professor-- and for good reason.  He is a funny, intelligent man who tries very hard to make his classes interesting--which is why I feel guilty admitting that I strongly disliked the class, and would certainly NOT recommend it.  Initially, the lectures seemed funny and entertaining--until I tried to take my notes and complete one of his problem sets, and realized that, despite having been to every class and being a fairly good note-taker, I had no idea how to do them.  From there on, things deteriorated.  The class is simultaneously mind-numbingly easy and ridiculously difficult.  I was bored during lectures, but found myself spending hours trying to interpret his problem sets, before giving up and going to office hours.  The lack of a book makes it still more difficult to decipher the material, and pretty much  impossible to study for his tests.

Everyone should take this class with Larry regardless of whether one is a film major or not because you learn so much about the nature of media and film.  When I registered for this class I originally planned to drop it because I didn't have room in my schedule, but after attending the first lecture (I hesitate to use that term because he encourages so much discussion in class), I was hooked.  I learned more in the first class about filmmaking than I learned in some of my other classes all year.  While it may not be your cup of tea when Larry speaks over the film and points out the filmmakersÂ’ decisions, I found it to be a very effective method of teaching.  Larry does a great job of choosing films to show that demonstrate the different styles of documentary and gears much of the class toward examining how we differentiate between fiction and nonfiction film.  He is extraordinarily personable and I particularly enjoyed his tales of real life experiences he has had while filming.  Larry is very honest with his students, respects them, and lets them know what he really thinks.  He can sometimes be cynical about the nature of film and people, but ultimately it comes across that he loves this visual medium.  The first class, Larry started by pointing a camera at us and projecting the image on the board.  He then asked rhetorically why we were all watching him lecture on screen instead of in person.  Larry explained we love to have the story told for us and when a camera frames the shot it tells the story.  This was a perfect Larry-ism, a sort of statement that really got you thinking about the nature of film.  While I recommend any class that Larry teaches, I donÂ’t think I would have had as good a time in the intro to film class with him because it has a more specific intent and syllabus of theory to convey.  LarryÂ’s great when he has more freedom to teach what he wants. Ultimately, a great experience with a great and wonderfully laid back teacher.

My biggest problem with this class (other than the MIND-NUMBINGLY BORING lectures) was the fact that it was billed as an anthropology course and was, in actuality, a biology class.  I went in expecting an anthropology class from the anthropology department and instead wound up with a series of strictly structured lectures on bones and how they have evolved over billions of years! It was almost as if she was trying hard to make this class unpleasant.  If you do take this class I recommend taking it pass/fail because by the end you will be so BORED OUT OF YOUR MINDÂ—I can not stress this point enoughÂ—that you will not go to class except to take the weekly mandatory quiz.  The whole class is basically Ximena reading powerpoint slides out loud to the class (these slides are then posted online).  If you dare interrupt her to ask a question, she looks surprised, seems slightly frazzled, and the entire class stirs and awakes from a haze. Each class a ray of hope may shine down upon you, and as if granted by the will of God, she deviates from the slides to speak to you like a human being and relay an anecdote about scientists or a personal story.  And you will think, Â“Thank you God!"" and then you will be let down.  I left every class with the impression that Ximena was only teaching because she had to in between conducting research on monkeys.

The first day of class I was blown away, totally impressed by Kassanoff's brilliant lecture and seriously excited about the class. As time went by though, my attention waned and not because of the quality of the novels on the syllabus.  The novels themselves are amazing and, to be fair, Kassanoff sometime had some truly interesting ideas (although some were difficult to swallow).  My main problem with this course was the lack of focus on the novel. In fact, some days were spent only discussing the historical articles in the coursepack, which I found to be ridiculous (and I am one of those people who actually likes examining the historical context during which the novel was written, but what went on in this course was just too much for me).  Moreover, the strange thing about this course is that it is both a literature course and the intro to American studies course at Barnard.  If you want a literature course, take something else.  If you want to sit around every day listening to historical theories with a minimal focus on the primary text, by all means sign up for this course. And for those of you who like prompt grading, don't expect it from Kassanoff.  It took her three weeks to turn in our final grades.

This assignment sounds reasonable, but  actually turns into a nightmare since all of your sources have to have been published either 15 years before or after the publication date of the book you're writing about. One mandatory meeting with Kassanoff, two mandatory meetings with writing fellows, and an extremely long final exam with ids from the coursepack and novels and two essays (one a comparison and the other a general essay using three texts).

Alright, maybe some of the reviews of Valderrama are unfair (particularly the one comparing her to Hal from A Space Odyssey 2003), but it is true that she clearly does not want to be teaching.  She would much rather be researching monkeys.  The most excited I saw her all semester was when she related how jealous all the scientists were of the bonobo monkeys who had free sex to increase social bonds.  But when all is said and done, at an incredible university like Columbia, why would you waste your time taking a class from a teacher who doesn't want to be there and who the best thing that can be said about her is ""she isn't that bad""?

Julie Crawford is a good teacher in my opinion.  She makes boring dead Greek people actually seem interesting.  The class is pretty much interactive lecture interspersed with group excercises.    If you're a shy person then it's possible to open up cuz Julie's an approachable person. She is available 2 times a week for office hours which I found very helpful.  Some people have said that she disregards their ideas but I didn't really have any problems. Overall an awesome teacher.

Having taken classes with most of the professors from the philo department, I can say without reserve that Collins is one of the better ones.  The material covered in Metaphysics is extremely interesting and mind-boggling.  The subject of metaphysics was novel to me.   Most of us are more acquainted with theories of logic, epistemology, classical philosophy, etc.  But metaphysics truly takes philosophy to a new level.  With that said, there is virtually no reading material to this class, which can be a blessing or a curse.  To do well in this class, unless you are David Armstrong himself, you should definitely attend every lecture and take notes.  Collins presents arguments in a very dynamic fashion.  The topics are interesting.  But in the end, it's up to you to sort out all the theories and come to the conclusion yourself which theory is most viable.  He will answer questions and will often take your opinion into consideration.  A very challenging subject, taught be an experienced professor.  One of the better courses at Columbia.

Keith is peacing out to Greece for a semester so he won't be teaching until Fall 2004 at the earliest.  On the first day of class, I literally wanted to shoot myself in the head at the sound of Keith's monotonous voice explaining to the class how the sound hits various parts of the ear.  Added to that, music hum is a two hour class (a 2 hour class that the CORE can very easily do without).  Anyway, I stuck with the class (few did).  Class always droned on (thank god for the Spec's daily crossword puzzles), Keith continued to mumble and I learned relatively little for a class of that length.

All the reviews you've heard about Sidorsky ring true.  He is old, can't see worth a damn and tends to repeat himself to the point where you want to shoot yourself-- that is if you are even awake to hear what the lectures.  With that said, it's probably a blessing he's so repetitive.  Given that you attend class, you are to sure to retain some of the main points he expounds upon.  He covers six concepts in total and said concepts will be ingrained in your head for good.  An easy A if you have the willpower to attend most of the lectures (see, you don't even have to attend all).  I do like him quite a bit as a professor.  He knows his material and if you read his articles, you'll find that he's extremely intelligent and articulate.

One of the best professors in the philo department by far.  He is witty, organized and articulate.  More importantly, he teaches Logic with a certain zest that is hard for one to ignore.  He also teaches Logic in an organized and user-friendly style that makes an otherwise difficult subject seem less so.  HIs lectures are extremely organized.  He uses powerpoint presentations but only as a guide and not the sole basis of lectures.  You will appreciate these presentations after trying to read that dreaded Logic book written by our dear Gaifman.

I agree with what one other reviewer said.  This class is definitely taught in the style of an upper level high school history course (think AP but less memorization).  Thad lectures and the class takes copius amounts of notes.  He's a labor historian, so he tends to focus on his area of expertise which can get boring if you're not all that into the labor movement.  Reading is light for a history course.  He mostly emphasizes the documents that he expects you to analyze.  With that said, it's an OKAY class.  A note on his grading style.  He gives you the essay topics in advance for the midterm and final, but it seems no matter how well you prepare, he just doens't give out As on the exams.  But if you want to be truly inspired, take Mark Carnes'  'America Since 1945'.  You will not be disappointed.  Guaranteed.

As a student just trying to get out of my science requirement, I found the class incredibly boring.  She's not an amazing professor; just relies on standard power point slides and multiple choice exams.  I felt like I could have gotten the same effect from a community college and saved a lot of money.  
She seems nice enough, but that certainly didn't make me look forward to sitting in a lecture hall for an hour watching text scroll on the screen.  She puts the slides online, but you still aren't completely safe skipping class, as they're bare-bones outlines of the lecture and not very good notes.   And relating every aspect of psychology to Friends did not exactly endear her to me.  If I could go back a semester, I'd take something else.

When I first stepped into this class, looked at the syllabus, and then listened to a nearly unintelligible lecture, I thought I was in for a very complex and tough course. Entirely uninterested in the lectures and the subject (Russell simply cannot convey anything about poli sci in an appealing, understandable way), I began to slack off in the reading, reaching a point where I realized I had not read from the textbook in over a month. Though there is absolutely nothing intellectually stimulating about this course, you can get an A without doing any reading--you do have to show up for every class though (attendance is mandatory--and really annoying at 9 am). The TA's are  very generous graders, and it's very possible to write the term paper in just a week (and get an A), do the take-home midterm without having opened the books before (and get an A) and cram for the final and once again, get an A. Definitely worth missing, but if you're looking for a filler course to boost your gpa, go ahead and take the class.

Just how I like my teachers-- supportive with her students while maintaining a cynical NY attitude that all Columbia instructors should be required to possess.  She really wants you to experiment with your writing and try new things, which is exactly what University Writing (or L&R, whatever) is all about.  Funny, engaging, and a snappy dresser; if you get her as an instructor, consider yourself extremely lucky, especially if you have any intention of going into writing as a career.

Some readings are lengthy, others short-- I'd say it balances out pretty well.  Every essay (except the last one) requires at least one rough draft to be handed in and marked up but not graded.  While this may seem like twice as much work, it makes the editing process a million times easier and quicker and ultimately your final drafts (and yes, the grades on them) will be far superior than if you hadn't done that first draft.  Occasional writing exercises that are fun and not time-consuming.  So workload is reasonable, definitely doable.  UW classes are small though, so come prepared to talk.

I really enjoyed Professor Aguilar's class. She loves the material that she teaches and knows the material extremely well, to the point of being able to quote from most of the works we read, in addition to obscure 12th century philosophers and famous 20th century gravediggers - I exaggerate here, but Aguilar does operate under the assumption that she probably knows more than you ever will or could hope to, and so whatever she says will be of some educational value. I can see how she could be intimidating to people who either don't do the reading or have continued trouble understanding the works, but if you keep up with the assignments and go to her office hours (which are numerous and convenient, to my mind) then you stand a good chance to get a whole lot out of her class.

Please, please don't believe the positive reviews. I did and made a big mistake by taking this class.  Creamer is really outgoing and seems nice at the beginning, but he is condescending and arrogant.  But the worst thing about this class is that WE NEVER TALK ABOUT THE BOOKS. And it's French Lit!! Instead you do oral reports about whatever you want and talk about books that you never read.  Even better, he'll call on you with questions about random things, like what is the Latin word for head.  Also, he will never learn your name despite the fact that there are 10 people in the class. So learn to love your name tag. Creamer always breaks the class up into awful discussion groups and instead of asking about anything important, makes you discuss things like the syntax.

Yick.  The seconds could not tick away fast enough a single day of her cursed class!  Yaelle acts as though she encourages you to ask questions at first, but once you begin to produce these questions, she seems to have extreme difficulty answering them.  She presents her answers in the same words with which she previously explained the topic.  The trouble is - if you are asking the question, chances are fair that you didn't understand the first explanation of the topic, and thus her answer is no better than her original presentation of the material.  When students had trouble with grammar points or concepts, especially when a few were having difficulty with the same ones, it would become apparent to Yaelle (in front of her class) that the students were not understanding her lecture and she got frustrated and moody.  Finally she would just continue to get louder and more flustered until she was at a loss and would resort to: ""It's JUST A RULE! You just must understand this to be this way.""

Like others have been saying, she is a wonderful woman, however if you would like to be taught by a professor and not your fellow classmates, stay away from her class. I felt that she should have just stayed teaching her middle eastern material. She has a great personality and always wanted the class to go to her outings (I went to a few...all fairly nice). But when it comes down to course work, the students did all the work. Yea, the last hour (which really wasnt an hour for her...more like 30mins) was taught by her, but after she was done making certain points in the book, she would call on people she knew didnt read the book, or really didn't have anything to say...Now I know that's what an instructor should do, but knowing that other Lit Hum prof. were teaching for 2hrs, and this woman wasn't...it really bothered me.

Hailey is king.  The man is very easy to approach, quite friendly, easygoing and generally nice. I loved his in-class demonstrations especially since they most often went wrong providing a break from the montony of lecture and reviving the class . One problem I had with him is that when he's lecturing he doesn't like to stop to answer questions, he just ignores your hand if it's raised. But in his defense, most of the questions kids asked were irrelevant musings that they threw out in an attempt to impress themselves on the teacher and show that they had read the book. The course is hard, but that is not Hailey's fault. He races through the stuff he expects us to know from high school but takes pains to make sure we understand the interesting stuff like special relativity and dark matter.

A special catch, Todd Gitlin is a professor of Journalism at Columbia's prestigious journalism school.  He is a Larry David look alike with a smile that could cure the world of polio.  He cares as much about  himself learning from the contemporary civlization texts as he expects his students to do.  Professor Gitlin's essential base of knowledge is so wide and deep (phd in sociology and journalism M.A in political science)  that he makes up for many of the core texts he admits to having never read before teaching the class.  As a result, Professor Gitlin's class wavers between thought provoking explanations and standard speculation.  Some of his classes fly by while others fall flat.  Much of it depends on what he knows and what he thinks he knows.  Nevertheless, Professor Gitlin is always open to challenge from students and he constantly challenges them through the socratic method.  Outside of class he always makes himself available and is eager to learn about his students ambitions and concerns.

This is a class you definitely want to stay in (or try to get in to.) Ms. White is fun, easy-going, helpful, and very knowledgeable. She has an extensive background in art history and Italian studies. She is one of a few teachers that make you want to learn and love the subject. She normally gives a brief background overview of an artist, and then shows several works using a slide projector, while she and the class hold a discussion on each work. She is very polite and respectful, and encourages participation. She is available for extra help, and even asks students to call her or email her if need be. She is always willing to help you on your paper assignments, and may sometimes take a re-submission into consideration. She is flexible (all teachers have their limits though) and in no way out to get you!

The key to doing well in her class is 1) go to class 2) pay attention and take notes (you'll do great on the exams) 3) participate.......The paper topics are clear and generally easy, but she grades them thoroughly, but fairly, with a pick and comb- but don't worry- like the others said the grade isn't as bad as you would imagine. The midterm and final were easy as long as you studied and paid attention in class. The readings were short and almost optional- again, as long as you pay attention to the discussions of them in class, you'll do fine in incorporating them in the exams. The final and midterm consisted of ID's, short answer, comparison, and essay-- they were do-able, just a lot of writing!

I want to add one cautionary note to these glowing (and accurate) reviews. Dard teaches with great charsima and true zeal for the subject matter, but look out when it comes to his grading criteria. He expects your papers to encompass the minutia of the texts you've covered, which adds an element of tedium to your experience of the class. You may end up feeling like you spend more time covering your tracks than building an argument because of this tendency in his grading. If you're a card-carrying ""big picture"" person, you may want to take this into consideration. On the whole, though, a great prof, one of the best I've had.

Let me first respond to one of the more critical reviews.  The reviewer acknowledges not going to the lectures and then complains about the lack of examples.  Hmmm... That should raise a red flag or two.  While Preston did not give an example for every problem, the combination of actually reading the assignment and going to the lectures was more than enough to figure out the problems.  
If your are interested in Macro, take this class.  Preston covers all the basic material.  The best part, however, is when he goes off on interesting tangents about case studies of the material.  He does a much better job of covering this aspect of the material than the text book does.  To summarize: If your are interested in economics and want to learn how models you learn are applied to the real world, you will probably enjoy this class.  If you just want to escape with doing as little as possible, you probably won't.

This professor is ""a nice guy,"" but that doesn't save his teaching style.  He is a big fan of over-the-top adverbs, making them from words that are just too long already --his lectures could sound something like ""the transnational effect of the strucural top-down phenomenon of the processes hold a historically and intellectually-based position in the hierarchical hegemony."" He honestly talks exactly like that during class. The class ""discussions"" mostly involve him asking questions most of the class cannot possibly answer, and him shooting down any student who may not be  entirely correct. The workload is rather heavy, but manageable.  I did well but still have no idea what his grading style is. Probably fairly leneint. Fill your papers with sociological jargon and as long as you make some sense, you will probably do ok.

Though Balmer himself is as nice and knowledgeble as the others have written, I found his grading style to be atrocious.  I don't think he touched a single paper or exam anyone in the class handed in - didn't read any of them or even verify the grade.  The TAs graded everything, and they were rather unpredictable and in one case, downright mean about the comments.  I was so frustrated and hurt by one particular TA's comment on a paper I threw it out in the nearest trash can -- they were utterly unhelpful and bordered on being personal.  I found it hard to keep up my enthusiasm for the course when I realized neither professor nor TA cared who their students were nor how they were doing.

It is a challenge to describe what Professor Popkin has done to me, how she has influenced me, how incredibly powerful her classes are and how intelligent, knowledgeable, intellectual, nice (extremely nice)... she is so complete. She is definitely the best teacher I've had in Columbia. And about the syllabus -WOW!!! Yes, it's a lot of reading, but reading the last lines of Fathers and Sons or Brothers Karamazov can make you see the world in a very different way, while inviting you into the complex but unique realm of word and metaphor, of color and painting, of PURE PASSION! (You can see how much this course excited me!!!) And as one of the other reviewers comments, the students who took this course with me were quite incredible (of course we got more than one boring and sometimes irrelevent comment -but there's a con to every pro). Also, visit her during her office hours. She is always open to any questions/comments... and I can say that this goes beyond the classroom topics.

Dr. Gibber is a fantastic prof, one of the best in the bio department. I disagree with the negative comments about her lectures, she does go on tangents at times, but her powerpoint lectures are always well organized and clear and are posted on the web after class, and all the material on her exams comes from the lectures. It's an advantage to do the optional reading before class, but not necessary. Gibber's great about answering questions, if she doesn't know herself she'll look it up and then respond. She's also very open about office hours, she doesn't post them but if you stop by her office and she's there she's usually available to talk. Definitely recommend this class to others!

If you get into his section, DROP IT OR SWITCH TO ANOTHER SECTION. Don't get me wrong he explains the material VERY well and you will learn alot, but he has to be the most condescending instructor I have ever had in any subject ever. He will pick on everyone in class and call on you for answers or interpretation whether you like it or not. If you look like you haven't done the reading, he will DEFINITELY pick on you.  He constantly makes , in my opinion, defamatory comments to people he does not like and that usually means everyone (unless you declare that you are an art history major and show it, then you will get the red carpet treatment). Mr. Onafuwa has absolutely no regard for the feelings of his students or for views that conflict with his own. DONT EVER BE ABSENT because you have to call his house and present a logical excuse that he will follow up on and your grade will suffer if you do not attend. You have to do all of the readings when he says to do them because he questions everyone in class and if you don't know the answer you will be ridiculed and penalized for it. It is like being in junior high school again with his constant babying and criticizing of everyone. Ever need an extension on work or a paper? TOO BAD, you will not get one here even if one of your parents died, if by some stroke of magic you do, it will come with the appropriate lecture and belittling.

If you get Jennifer Sonntag for University Writing, you are very lucky. Although timid at first, Ms. Sonntag qucikly establishes a great dynamic with the class. During discussions about the excerpts we read, rather than pushing the class towards a particular focus, she gently guides while allowing the students to expound upon their own conclusions. The topics assigned for the essays were pretty flexible, allowing you to explore your own area of interest (save for the dreaded constellation essay... no one in any university writing section really knew what to do about that). Ms. Sonntag is a very fair grader as well... she is more concerned with the structure and quality of your writing, rather than nitpicky about small grammatical errors or punctuation mistakes. (She'll correct them on your paper, but she won't take off unless it's really bad). Also, you can tell she really puts effort into reading each paper by the lengthy and insightful comments she makes. I feel I grew more as a writer in one semester with this class than in my entire four years of high school.

I thought he was an awesome instructor. He was flexible about how close we stayed to the standard topics discussed, and I thought that made the class much more interesting. We were able to simply glance at topics that didn't really interest anyone, and spend a lot of time on those that more people felt strongly about. His writing assignments were not typical--300 word response essays, which could have as much or as little to do with the book as you wanted. I felt the assingments were very helpful in making me realize what was superfulous in my writing (which was his intention). He rarely left many comments on papers, and the ones he did leave were not very helpful, but he made himself very easily available outside of class, and was extremely helpful then. He would also discuss a paper before it was due, which helped a lot in writing it. He's also a pretty interesting guy, and worth stopping by the lounge just to talk to in general. And he's a VERY generous grader...won't give an A very easily, but will give an A- to a lot and a B+ to almost anything that's decent.

Yes, it's true. At first, all the people in Turro's class thought they were the chosen ones. While those in Fine and McDermott's class slaved over the textbook, those in Turro's class laughed and then went their merry way, practice questions in hand. Midterms came and went, Turro's flock barely having raised an eyebrow, Fine's children cursing our names. Then... the FINAL came... and the moans that rose up out of Havemeyer 309 were worse than those during the Black Death! The pages flipped as each student searched desperately... where were the practice question... where were they? Their minds raced... ""Oh my God"" they thought... WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY DO SOME CHEMISTRY. Heads down, they went up to the TA's to hand in the exam with somber faces... THey knew that coupled with no curve in Turro's class, they had failed. 
Ok, so, here's the deal. I hope you liked my dramatic story, because ask anyone in Turro's class... that's EXACTLY how it was. Turro started off with every midterm EXACTLY from the practice questions. And then he screwed the whole class. I'm beginning to think someone from the chem department saw the culpa review that some jerk did in november and chastised Turro for it. Nonetheless, be careful. While it was very unfair for Turro to do that to us, the tests, even without the practice questions, were fair. It was just that no one studied all that much because the practice questions were there. Anyway, word to the wise... he was still better than Fine or McDermott, but don't slack off if he decides to pull a fast one again.

His grading was pretty fair, and he seemed to care about his students' progress and wanted those who don't participate to talk more.  He's a pretty good instructor.  But I think if anything, his class lacked structure.  His essay topics were usually awful, class discussions often spiraled into useless crap (e.g. angst from literary topics not resolved from Lit Hum, which had absolutely NOTHING to do with CC), he let students who obviously had not done the reading waste a whole bunch of time talking about issues that could have been resolved had they done the reading, and other bad things.

This is a great professor and a great class.  West really knows her stuff in terms of anthropology, economics, sociology, and philosophy that she has you read in the class.  She is very smart, very articulate, and very funny (both at times that she means to be and at times when she has no idea that she is being). She is also one of the most engaging and charismatic speakers I have ever encountered.  I walked into this class simply wanting to take a class with West.  As an anthropology major I had heard that I had to take one with her before I graduated.  I walked out of the class wanting to study consumption issues for a Masters or PhD.  I can't say enough good things about West and this class. Every anthropology major (and everyone else for that matter) should take a class from her before they leave Columbia.
I also feel the need to comment on some of the other reviews that state that she is ""openly left"" or ""political"" in class.  Actually, I thought that she was the most neutral professor I've had yet.  She was equally critical of the left and the right (when it came up).  She seems to see the world as ultimately f**ked up because of the way that capitalism and its agents have created a set of social relations between people where everything is about buying and selling things (ideas, people, images....).  I sort of see this as neither left nor right but rather as a true intellectual way of seeing social life.  
She is just a wonderful professor and a wonderful person.  My friends and I ran into West and her husband at the West End one night.  She stopped by our table, introduced herself and her husband to my friends and talked to us for about 10 minutes.

Prof. Murphy is very intelligent, well-traveled, and once you get to know her she's really very nice.  However, the class is colloquium but is really in lecture format.  That means two full hours of political economy lectures with interruptions only for her to quiz you on the material.  Because I am actually very interested in the material, I enjoyed the class.  It covers a great deal of valuable information and I learned a lot.  However, if you do not have economics background and your own firm opinions, go into this class realizing that she's going to present her own views and push them rather heavily.  She makes a half-hearted attempt to present views more liberal than her own and if you are even slightly left of center, you may have a very, very hard time taking this class.  In all honesty, Prof Murphy would rather be teaching at SIPA and sometimes it really comes across.  She doesn't really give students enough credit to have intelligent views of their own and will therefore basically tell you what your final topic should be.  I also have to say that I also felt that her grading was very subjective and rather unfair.  Also, alert to those who think this is going to include China!

He works hard to encourage participation, but because he is really just a student himself, working to finish up his degree, he understands where you're coming from as someone with a million things to do.  Because his studies are in political philosophy, he is very passionate about this and will push off some of the works initially on the syllabus to make way for extra discussion on his favorites.  Mehmet doesn't do the best job of keeping the awkward silences from creeping in, but he's incredible, taking us for the best CC dinner ever at Symposium and giving me an A-.

Leslie is great.  The words that fall from her mouth are like little truisms waiting to be imbed themselves in your brain and vocabulary and give you a new window on life.  She is obviously primarily concerned with finishing her own book, which occasionally makes her a little absent-minded (she told us the same stories sometimes five or six times, but we always liked them and didn't want to hurt her feelings), but she does well at bringing us back the essence of what we're trying to do.  She did kind of slack on giving us assignments - a high school creative writing class would have given you more of a portfolio.  But she is a great writer and a great counselor - expect class to go long quite often, because she doesn't keep track of the time well.

Erzen is great, although she comes off as really cold, it's just her manner, and she really cares a lot and wants to help you do well.  The class is an undertaking, with an outside project that requires tons of time, probably at least five or six hours a week outside class when all is said and done.  Lots of reading, but every bit of it is fascinating and you'll find yourself looking forward to it if you have the energy.  Lots of class discussion, so be sure you look like you know what you're talking about, at least, because the class is also usually tiny.  This is a great seminar for a religion major, or a sociology, or an urban studies - multidisciplinary.  You'll meet great people and your boundaries will be pushed, and although this class is really really stressful and you'll be asked to perform under pressure a lot, you'll be glad you did it afterwards.

Segal is someone you'll either love or hate.  His unashamed placement of his owns texts on the syllabus is laughable.  His arrogance can sort of be admired abstractly for what it is.  He is, however, one of the world's leading experts on Judaism.  His class is ill-organized and -attended, but he really doesn't seem to care.

Crazy.  Amy Trumpetter is one of the most disorganized, unapproachable, and unhelpful professors in existence.  Did I mention that she's crazy?  She'll stare off into space as if something catches her eye, but nothing is there.  Also note that this class is nothing like the course description.  It claims to tackle concepts of theatre as it relates to society, but is truly nothing more than a nonsensical sequence of puppet shows and poorly-acted scenes...and not the fun kind of puppet show.  You do have to get up on stage for this class.  I like acting, and I still despised most of these exercises.  The other teachers, Denny & Steve, are not so bad.

oooh, Marie.  As another reviewer stated, she is quite hard of hearing, and speaks with what at first appears to be an accent, but I think is actually some sort of speach impediment. One cannot hold this against her, however it can be frustrating when you make a valid point on a text and it is completely lost on her.  However, besides this slight disability Prof. Logan is good person to have for lit hum.  We moved slower than the other classes, but still managed to cover almost everything.  I felt well-prepared for the final.  She does, however, place unnecessary emphasis on the historical aspects of the books.  She frequently points out locations on maps, or writes-out the Greek lettering of certain words, which is lost on the entire class.  But you just sit and nod and don't worry about it.  She tends to play favorites, if not in grading, at least in the treatment of students in class and will poke fun at some, but all these minor faults are more humorous than anything else.  Prof. 
Logan likes and wants what's best for her students, will look at drafts, and gives less work than many professors-- that's what counts.

Like any halfway decent supporting actor, Moxey was short on screen time, but when he was lecturing, every eye and ear was on him. Perhaps it was the accent, perhaps it was the Sean Connery-esque look, perhaps it was because he was just a good lecturer; either way, Moxey teaches you the basic themes and ideas you need to know for each era. 
The class itself, when Moxey isn't around, can get pretty boring, as revealed by the snoring that often accompanied lectures. It should also be noted that just because this course is labeled intro does not make it easy; in fact, because of the wide span of time this class covers, it is probably more difficult than other higher level courses. But if you've studied enough and memorized the basic facts, the class should not be too challenging.

There was certainly the high expectation of intense preparation for each class, which she aptly called seminars.  The syllabus was packed, but each of the the carefully selected readings was examined through a rich class discussion, so I never felt like I was wasting my time with time-consuming preparation for each seminar.  It was tough for some of the less-fluent speakers to follow some of the abstract ideas being covered, but there was such a volume of discussion being had in each seminar that sooner or later a subject that everyone could understand was bound to come up.  I admire her dedication to her profession, which showed every time class ran 20 minutes overtime (Be prepared, that's pretty much every time.), and trust me, she is more than charming enough to get away with it.

Who wrote that professor Edlund treats students like adults??? Her class is very boring and dull. She spends a lot of time going over obvious issues and skips all of the analytical parts of the course that actually do need explaining. But because she makes attendance mandatory and knows your name you have to suffer through her lectures. Furthermore, your performance on her tests is pure luck! They are not related to her lecture notes or the textbook so you are pretty much lost and on your own even if you do study. She ONLY grades your answers so there is NO partial credit. On the bright side, because everyone is as lost as you are, the curve is very low and you can manage an OK grade even if you learned absolutely nothing. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IF: you want to learn, or if you want an easy A, or if you are actually interested in the material.

This class is bad on all levels.  If you are a novice to Russian history, Professor Wortman's boring style and the characterless textbook will repel you from the subject and make it difficult for you to learn anything.

It is inconceivable to me that anyone could take Sam's class, work remotely hard, and come away with a negative impression of him.  He is the best facilitator of seminar discussion I encountered at Columbia.  He is genuinely interested in his students and willing to offer advice related to Columbia.  Perhaps most importantly, he has an awesome sense of humor, and his class is just fun.  Also, and this is especially important for summer classes, he wasn't afraid to let the class go if we'd discussed everything necessary before the end of the class period (which in a 3 hour class is huge).

Warning: This class is taught from an economic historian's perspective.  So much time was spent examining tax policies, new fiscal measures for each emperor's reign, beginnings of capitalism etc.  Because of the emphasis on economics, I felt that Prof Zelin ignored the cultural and social aspect important to a course meant to be an overview of China from the fall of the Ming to the 1911 Revolution.

Furthermore, Dr. Hart is one of the best and most knowledgeable professors I have had the privilege of having at Columbia.  The workload is fair and he gives review sheets for each test, which are very helpful.  I studied them hard and received no lower than an A on all of the exams.  There are also weekly quizes that insure students will go to class, which seemed to bother the other reviewers--which makes no sense to me because you are supposed to go to class.

If you're going to look for a job in I.T. after graduating with whatever degree you're working towards, this class is a must. The fact that Linux is used as a case study throughout this course is *immensely* useful, if only that OS courses at other universities are taught with merely pedagogical operating systems such as Minix or Nachos. That said, the programming part of the homeworks was arduous and time-consuming (yet rewarding once you gradually grokked a solution, which ended up being less than 50 lines of code for most of the assignments). An able CS undergrad would spend anywhere between 10 to 20 hours a week on the homeworks (written + programming parts combined). Nieh's lectures are very straightforward, and they are very much worth attending. The class is all about *detail* -- for those in systems, there is mounds of it to drum into your head, and this class gives you good practice. The worst part of the class is not the homework, but the morons that you can be potentially be paired up with for doing the programming assignments.  Your partner may contribute nothing, yet s/he can get all of the credit for your hard work. Luckily, you get to submit reviews of your partners and they swap around the programming partners based on those reviews after the first two assignments.

This class should have been called 17th Century Italian art with a brief look at France and Spain. We spent all of september and october on Italy, turning to France mid-November.  Professor McPhee knows a lot. She is certainly well-educated (she got her PhD at Columbia). Professor McPhee, however, is not Columbia quality. Indeed, her lectures did have a ""read from the page"" feel. They also were not all that inspiring. And, to top it off, she recapped the last lecture in the beginning of the next. So, if you missed class you didnt have to worry. 
Her workload expectation was a little ridiculous. She expected us to buy a whole plethora of books (none of which I actually read). For our second paper assignment, she put 5 books on reserve at Avery and asked us to write a critical analysis of  one of them. Now, think about that, 5 books on reserve at Avery for a class of about 50. How much sense does that make? I couldnt tell if McPhee never thought about having a course reader or was just too opposed to getting one.
All in all, this class barely registered as a blip on my radar screen, except for when it came down to the exams and papers. The exams were pretty difficult: you had to know about 150+ images (artist, title, date, location, significance).

In fact I had such a good time taking this course that I can easily say it's the best core class I've taken, and one of the best I've had overall at Columbia.  She really knows her stuff about the the artists and architects (her background is in architecture).  Her lectures were packed with interesting slides of the artists' works and the best part is that she actually let the students make most of the comments about the art.  She constantly asks the class for their thoughts or ideas, and seems to genuinely appreciate different student perspectives.  Like other good Art Hum teachers, Lucy also made the class take advantage of NYC's resources.  At the beginning of the semester she took us on a class field trip to the Cloisters, and then 2 out of our 4 individual papers also required going out to art museums (Met, Frick, MoMA).  Her grading on papers is not terribly difficult, at least not after you learn to do formal analysis - which she will teach you.

Professor Graham is an incredibly nice person, perhaps she'd make a nice grandmother, but that doesn't qualify her to teach an intro psychology class.

Nothing much happens in class other than her talking about vision and using a gratuitous number of overhead slides, which I don't think anyone fully understood. She shows a lot of videos (so you have to go to class) and then doesn't really talk about them. Part of the problem with the class is that it's virtually impossible to take notes since she really doesn't stay on point. I'd agree that the textbook was good and interesting, but honestly I can read a textbook on my own. I want a professor who's going to add to the book. Unfortunately, Professor Graham just can't stay on track. The course is definitely geared towards those who have already taken a neuroscience class and with her field of research being vision you will get more than you bargained for in that area. If you're content to read the textbook and really gain nothing more than that by all means take this class. My advice would be to take The Science of Psychology in the fall. When push comes to shove this class is about memorizing as much of the textbook as possible so you can ace the multiple choice tests.
Workload:
Two class-length multiple choice tests that cover a lot of material and ask very specific questions. Neither test is hard, but both require excellent memorization skills.
Two 8-10 page papers broken down into three sections. You (and a partner if you want) will have to do such fascinating exercises as write your own multiple choice questions and explain a function of the brain in a story book fasion. The papers are long and not particularly interesting.
This class is not incredibly hard, nor incredibly easy. If you do all the reading and have a good memory you can easily get an A-.

Prof. O'Shaughnessy creates note packets that he places on the web, and teaches more or less directly from them.  This is a good thing, in that it tells you exactly what was covered in the course, but the danger, as always, is thinking that you can slack off all semester and skim the notes before the exams (which you *cannot* do).  The course material is moderately difficult, but Prof. O'Shaughnessy does a solid job of presenting it.

Although Professor Pasztory does seem to know just about everything concerning the Pre-Columbian world, her lectures are by no means ""riveting."" In fact, that is about the last word I would use to describe them. 
The saving grace of the class is the fact that the material is so incredible and different. It is a frustrating experience to sit through a class which examines works as exciting and unique as those of the Pre-Columbian world, but to have a professor who cannot remotely reflect this excitement. Pasztory's presentation is so hurried and unvaried that it is hard to really allow anything she says to sink in. I would still recommend the class to anyone interested in Pre-Columbian art, but it is largely a disappointment.

One hates, by which I mean relishes, escoriating another student's review, but as the only one written up on Nedim is, to put it politely, disgustingly stupid, entering an opposing view seems morally neccessary. That he is ""the nicest gut you'll meet"" I wouldn't dream of disputing. His demeanor borders on the excessively genial- this leads to his one serious flaw, an all too appearant lack of self-confidence which marrs his rather incisive presentation of what he's personally gleaned from the material. The claim that his reading of the texts tends toward the superficial is aburd and could only come from one who is a simplistic and superficial reader in his own right. Certainly, he will never be found speaking ex cathedra, as if he as professor had some unique access to the one right explanation of any given text, but that is more a virtue than a vice. Nonetheless, he is an undeniably smart fellow who reads the texts in seriousness and regularly offers up quality commentary on what he's gleaned from them. His classes tend to be an informal, but generally insightful blast. The previous reviewer seems to have made the mistake of taking style for substance, and assumed Nedim's utterly chill demeanor implied a lack of intellectual seriousness; the extent to which this is not the case cannot be overstated.

This was one of the most interesting classes I've taken.  Professor Kay is a great lecturer.  I'm not a ""science person,"" but the class was easy to follow and she explained the concepts very well.  The math that's required can be challenging, but it's definitely manageable.  Prof. Kay uses power point for the lectures, which makes it easy to take notes.  Since she posts the lecture on Courseworks the day before class, you can print it out and add your own notes as necessary.  The reading from the text book is helpful for the midterm and final, but since much of it is covered in the lecture, it's probably possible to skim some parts.  The course is graded on a curve, and she's a fair to lenient grader.  If you attend the lectures, keep your notes in order, and do most of the reading, you'll be fine.

He goes out of his way to ensure that students don't have to work too hard. He gave away bonus points for just about anything: doing online practice tests, filling out surveys, etc.  He maintains the courseworks website so that it always has relevant information. Test questions are always from the online practice tests. Before tests he has a online discussion board on which he or his TAs answer questions posted by students.

I read reviews of this class before taking it, and until after the midterm I wasn't quite as excited about the professor or the way class was run as other people were.  The beginning texts, although when read again were fantastic, at first read were confusing in combination with her jumbled lectures which never really corresponded with what was being assigned to read.  The other thing, everyone in the lecture hall used laptops for about two thirds of the semester, and finally she banned them.  She kept saying how we didn't need to take all the notes we were taking, and she was right.  Lectures are important to attend, but very little of it will be necessary for the midterm and final.  Using a notebook all semester will force you to cut out all the things you will end up studying for no reason.
But the woman is incredible, I couldn't have asked for a more eye opening person to begin my undergraduate career with.  It's clear that all she wants is for the class to learn what she loves, and it's her enthusiasm that pushes everyone over the edge into loving the material themselves.

Basically, you forget you're in the class for two weeks because lectures are incredibly painful (at nine oclock in the morning on a FRIDAY) and all information you could research on the internet and present yourself.  Which means many people don't go to any.  And then, when a problem set is due you stay up late until the morning of lecture attempting to complete problems you know you should be able to do, but somehow can't because it's the most mindless busy work... therefore making you feel stupid.  Apparently this class is about learning the process.  This should have been made more clear in the beginning... I thought I was going to learn something besides Intergrated Science I in high school.  The goal of the class should be geared more towards creating a group of adults who will be more aware of current issues within the sciences (which was attempted), and most importantly how to help and actually do something about what one should walk away from the class with.

Workload:
Technically light, problem sets every two weeks, no midterm this time, participation, and final.  Final does not have anything unexpected it's very much like the best problems from the sets.  Word of advice: go to your discussion section in addition to someone else's who you've heard is a good disc leader.  Don't be afraid to drop in on other sections.

Li Laoshi seems like a basically nice person who was thrown into a REALLY BAD situation of teaching beginning students while having *extremely* limited English skills and no prior teaching experience.  As a result, this class consistently pushed the limits of acceptability in terms of consistency and clarity. She would often write in simplified characters (even on tests) and sometimes was unable to remember the correct traditional characters.  More problematically, her language difficulties left me often unable to understand what our homework assignments were, what our quizzes were going to cover, when/where our drill sessions were meeting, what in-class activity we were supposed to be doing, and how to use grammar rules.  As a result of these communication difficulties, I left almost every class frustrated and confused.  This was not really her fault, but it was definitely a huge oversight by the department to allow someone with such limited English skills to teach the 2.5 class.  
Beyond her language problems though, Li Laoshi often seemed unsure of how to organize and pace the class.  She would neglect to finish explaining a concept or rule but then expect to test us on it in the next class.  Or she would try to assign long passages for us to memorize in two days.  In those cases, most of the time, the entire class would protest and she would revise the schedule to give us some extra time.  But it seemed wrong that we had to constantly do that in the first place.
This course completely shook my confidence in my (admittedly already not great) language skills and my interest in trying to keep learning chinese (at least at columbia).  Li Laoshi is not a mean person and she's not out to give you a bad grade, but if you have any interest in having a positive experience in learning Chinese AVOID THIS TEACHER AT ALL COSTS.  I've had one other Chinese teacher at Columbia and she was great.  I've also heard about other excellent instructors in the department.  In short, you can do much better than Li Laoshi.

Like other sections, this class had a VERY heavy workload; weekly drill sessions; a short quiz every class (memorize memorize memorize!!); essays and recitation assignments; chapter tests; an oral midterm; oral and written finals.  The saving grace of my grade was that the written final was extremely easy.  What was particularly bad was that this already very challenging class was rendered even more difficult by Li Laoshi's awful teaching.

I feel as though this review should focus more on the class itself than Prof. Kelley's particular teaching style, which plays only a minor role in the whole FroSci experience.  The newly designed science core course has many bugs to work out yet. The problem sets are easy, but very frustrating (there's a lot of independent, online research involved that gets tedious really quickly).  The lectures themselves were interesting and valuable, though their unfortunate placement on friday mornings meant I slept through many of them. 
As for the discussion sections, they often had only nominal connection to the lectures. Prof. Kelley had some creative ideas in her approach to each subject matter, but often times our meetings were simply a bore.  She resorted to a lot of group and individual presentations later in the semester, which I got almost nothing out of. Don't get me wrong, she's a sweet lady whose passionate about the course, and her quirkiness is rather charming, but every aspect of the course retains a coarseness that needs to be sorted out.
Probably my biggest problem with the course was how much the professors involved taught down to their students. The class claims to be designed for science and non-science people, but I can' t imagine that anyone who manage to get accepted to Columbia was as science-ignorant as they assumed us to be.  I sincerely hope this does not become a required core course next year, because if it does a ton of students are going to find themselves very frustrated.  That said, FroSci is an easy A for students with any scientific background.

He takes his job very seriously. Unfortunately he also has no sense of humor. He comes up with complicated exercises, doesn't explain them well, then gets frustrated when no one understands what we are supposed to do. Because of this class discussions could be frustrating.
On the other hand, he was available during his office hours and flexible about other meeting times. He is very willing to help and provides useful insights during one on one meetings, unlike in class time.  He also took the class on a fun field trip.
He gets overly excited about the library and his doctorate, but his enthusiasm can be sort of endearing.

This is one of the best courses I have taken in any department.  Mary has an impressive resume and understands choreography as an art on a higher level than anyone else I have encountered, but she is truly a great professor because she cares about her students and understands what she needs to do to help them reach their potential.  She worked with each student in class in a different way, pushing each of us when we needed to be pushed and letting us discover our own style and methods when we were headed in an exciting direction.  In a class of varying skill levels and experience, each student developed a unique style, created intruiging compositions, and I think we all surpassed our own expectations and learned a lot about ourselves.

I agree with the other reviewer, Professor Fisher is very skilled at leading discussions -- she often jokes with students and strikes a good balance between sticking to the material and allowing us to go off-topic onto subjects that interest us personally.  
She pretty much covers all the information from the readings in class, which makes it easy to slack off -- but beware! -- her exams require a lot of memorization -- particularly for the midterm, you must know all the names and dates of all the authors you have read (approx. 2-3 per class), so that requires some tedious memorization.

He's a good teacher, and the subject matter in this course was fascinating, so I'd definitely recommend it.  Until midterms the course focuses on Japan in World War II, its aggression in Asia and the Pacific, its diplomacy and internal political wrangling.  Then the course moves forward to the Korean War, then to the Vietnam War.  It's not a military history course, and it's not a social history course either, though it necessarily touches on each of those issues.  More than anything it's a study of diplomatic history.  His lectures were always informative and interesting enough, though he's not the best lecturer at Columbia.  (He's young, and sometimes he seemed a bit nervous in his role as professor, and like he's still learning how to do the job.)  He's at his best talking about the Korean War--Korea is his specialty.  He also regularly talked about current affairs, drawing conclusions and parallels from the conflicts we'd been studying and discussing their contemporary relevance, while warning us not to overgeneralize.  (In fact, on the final we could choose to write an essay detailing the advice we would give US policy-makers on any international issue(s) based on our ""expertise"" on the Pacific-Asia Wars.)  Prof. Armstrong is also a warm, easy-going guy who routinely opens his lectures to discussion and cracks somewhat dry, satirical jokes.  However, the one time I approached him to talk, he acted quite distracted--I wasn't sure if he was uninterested in what I was saying, ill-at-ease, or thought he had more urgent things to do, or some combination of the above.  He's also a movie fanatic, and tries to spread his enthusiasm to the class by showing lots of required films on the wars.  They were interesting but maybe not the best use of our time, all in all.  But it doesn't matter because it's truly unneccessary to watch them, if you really don't want to.  The readings were all very informative, though a few were a bit dry; the others were great all-around.

Professor Dina Merrer is condescending.  If you are pre-med, I have four words for you: TAKE IT AT COLUMBIA!!!! If you are a Biology or a Chemistry major, and you must take the class, I pity you. Granted, Professor Merrer's lecturing style of writing on the board as she speaks makes it easy to take notes. However, the lectures are an absolute horror to sit through, Going to office hours is pointless.  There are weekly problem sets, handed out during recitation periods even during weeks when you have exams in the class. Furthermore, the questions are so difficult that they serve no practical purpose in the class. Her exams do not relate to those problems, or to the assigned book problems, which are even more useless. The readings are so pointless that even Professor Merrer advises you not to make them a priority. She also puts up practice exams, which are the closest you will come to predicting the format of the exam. However, the three exams are very challenging, and she will throw in surprises, so be prepared. The best way to study for them is to go over all of the reactions until you know them cold. 
Another important note is that Professor Merrer is extremely sensitive to any Â“disruptionsÂ” in the class. This includes people walking across the room, peopleÂ’s cell phones being turned on, and people talking outside of the classroom.

Columbia gives you the impression that you're getting a world-class education. If you get into this class, that whole illusion just flies right out the window.

Charles Armstrong is a pretty laid back professor. His biggest downside is that he does not project well when lecturing and does not seem too enthusiastic, but he definitely enjoys the material (at least the modern part) and is interested in talking about it. Korean Civ is a major cultures List A course, but unlike Japan or China, it does not have a discussion section (or didn't in Fall 2003); discussion is done through courseworks. I would guess that it's one of the easier List A's out there. Grading is usually handled by TA's who weren't the sharpest Korean historians and were generally easy-going like Armstrong. The readings for the course weren't too long, but a lot of them were devoted to a useless book of primary sources, so if you ignored those, there wasn't much at all (maybe 500 pages the whole semester). I think reading the main text, Korea: Old and New, and paying attention in lectures (sometimes difficult) is all you really need to do really well in this course.

I recommend her to anyone who wants to take her class for Elementary Chinese - the grammar isn't ridiculously difficult, so her English impediment wouldn't be such an obstacle unlike what the reviewers in Intermediate Chinese said (not that I think it's THAT bad anyway).

Abigail is the best teacher I have had since being at Columbia. She was well informed, friendly and led very interesting discussions. 
She always managed to be the perfect combination of fair yet firm in both her grading and assignments. I found her to be extremely approachable.

Given all this, Susan Elmes, while not making the class magically easy, managed to do an excellent job. She is clearly masterful when it comes to economics-- a total genius. And on top of that, she is able to present the information clearly and precisely; she never pauses to check anything and never stumbles over words.

One of the most ridiculously awful professors I've ever had. Some of the readings on theory from the first two or three weeks were interesting, but many of the readings he assigns (which were often not put made available on CourseWorks or in the Reserve Library until a week or two after they were assigned) are redundant and completely inane. He managed to waste eighty-five minutes twice each week transcribing an outline on the board that was always completely worthless. He spent most of the time writing up ""definitions"" on the board that meant absolutely nothing. His grasp of the material (which is fairly basic) was less than impressive--his lectures were almost always simplistic and ignored the more nuanced treatment of material in the readings. When all three TAs obviously know much more than the professor, something is wrong. This really is the worst class I've ever taken (either at Columbia or even back in high school), and what little I came away with was no thanks to Professor Stacey.
Workload:
Unevenly paced but large reading load overall (some of which is useless). The two short papers and the midterm and final are graded pretty harshly and the criteria was unfair--consistently faulting us either for failing to explicate a particular comment in more depth, or failing to summarize given background information or basic theories when we were forced to write under a strict word limit (which was determined based on ease of grading and which Professor Stacey failed to fit either the questions or the grading criteria to).

Generally agree with the other reviews... if you're the typical columbia pre-med you already know how to do well in this class if you've taken bio.  his pace is relatively repetitive - you'll find yourself taking the same notes over and over - but it doesn't make the class easy.  Book is pointless as far as I found, make sure you go to class and get all the notes - every last three-time-repeated detail of them - and if you can get previous tests to practice on - it's priceless.  Problem sets are tough, very tough, they take much longer than you'd expect.  Start the night before and you won't finish - not for a decent grade anyway.

Bill Ryan is one of the most wonderful professors ever.  He's very sweet, attentive, responsive, and he really gets to know his class.  He spends as much individual time with a student as is necessary, and he helps out on all the tricky parts.  Helped me do an entire lab - without him, it would've been hopeless.  
BE WARNED:  this class is taught with Bill Menke.  Menke is quite the opposite of Ryan.  He makes up the problem sets of the first half of class, which are horrible horrible horrible.  You never know what to do with them and emailing him didn't help.  I asked how I can improve, his response: anticipate what i might be grading you on and do it.  Roger that, menke.  
This class is indeed quite time-consuming.  We were fortunate to have a great TA - Janet Baran - who combined with Ryan made this class very interesting and informative.

Prof. Krasna is a wonderful old man.  He loves his biochem.  But don't expect to learn much in class.  Get nice and close with your textbook and don't procrastinate.  I repeat, DON""T procrastinate.

It's not too bad if you're into that sort of thing, but you can't put it off til the night before an exam.

I'd like to give another perspective on this class, being that it is possible to have a life, AND pass this course with a pretty good grade. I assure you, I did it.  However, by no means am I implying that this course is easy or that there isn't a lot of work.  After all, this is chemistry, and they like to make you work your butt off to preserve the high standards and reputation of the science department here.  I actually heard that professors at other colleges were utterly baffled at our midterms.  That said, you don't have to do every single problem in the book, or every practice problem she assigns for the midterm.  The homework she assigns is excellent practice for the exams so dont kill yourself reading every little word and doing every problem in the book.  The woman knows what she is doing, so if you have questions, dont memorize the book, go talk to her.
About Prof Doerrer, she is absolutely the most wonderful professor teaching one of the the most painful semesters you will have if you are lucky enough to be pre-med.  She is understandable, extremely helpful, FUNNY, and soooo nice.  SHE KNEW EVERYONE'S NAME IN A 160 PERSON CLASS.  You can talk to her and she will tell you some of the coolest things about chemistry...or assure you that you are not stupid and you will be ok.  She completely made me regrett not majoring in chem.  Anyway she is also a very capable teacher.  As hard as the material is, she does an excellent job of teaching it, using jokes, analogies, whatever, and keeping you up, making you laugh, and getting you not to hate her after you just got a 50 on your second midterm.  and all of this at 9 AM, not an easy feat.
I honestly could not imagine a better person teaching me Chem than Prof. Doerrer.   The material is baffling at first, but then it makes sense (sort of) and you feel like you are Einstein.
The lab portion is really hard too, but once again, its possible to do well without giving yourself ulcers.  And the lab staff is WONDERFUL.  Overall I guess Barnard understands how hard and brutal chemistry is so I'm glad they've given us the best, funniest, and nicest professors to help us get through it.
Workload:
Its Doable, and you dont have to stay up til 2 am every morning to finish it. Once a week should be enough. i guess im kind of kidding, however you need to DO IT, it will save your ass.  Every problem she gives is excellent practice for the exams.  Stay on top of things I urge you, otherwise you will get confused.  Put effort into the problems, and make sure you understand them, it will pay off.  If you dont get it, go see her, she has office hours dedicated to the problem sets. get into the habit of doing it from the beginning, its for your own good, you either see her or cry when you have to figure it out on your own.  Also go to the review sessions for the exams, going in i felt like i had no clue about anything yet came out an hour and a half later feeling pretty confident.  The book is really good too, it helps fill in the holes and clears up loads of confusion, plus its simple, concise, kind of interesting, and pretty humorous at times.  Lab is hell, I won't lie to you.  apparently it helps lift most people's grade up.  god knows how, but it does.  the first 6 are pretty horrible, so go get help for them, trust me about 15-30 minutes will bring you from a c to an a.  im not lying, ive done it myself.  Do the experiments correctly, they are totally into accuracy, as my D+ will attest to.  you dont have to memorize the manual, just get an idea of what on earth you are doing, youll get out of lab quicker for it.  and as for the lab manual, god i hated that thing.  the lenghts they go to to make you figure out the most insanely difficult concepts only to tell you how to do it 3 pages later.  if youre confused check the part about caclulating the % error, it will expain how to do the problems...but why they chose to tell you once you've already labored for 5 hours to figure it out is beyond me.   anyway once the quantitative labs are over, lab actually becomes fun, and boy does your grade improve.  you now get to play with pretty colors, do some cool investigative experiments, figure out the contents of mysterious substances.  I know im making this sound overly exciting, but after 6 weeks of calculating .0001 accuracy, you will too.
So all in all, follow the manual, word for word, they like their lab reports the way they like them, and the more you follow the manual, the better your grade will be. if you go to get help, they will teach you how to better follow the manual so you get an a.  learn from the notes they make on your reports, a got a few A+'s doing so when my average grades were nowhere near that.    and remember, it's 30% of your grade, so dont slack off.
The exams are pretty hard too.  If you took ap chem youll get an a on the first one and spend the rest of the semester just as confused as everyone else.  but if you do the homework you'll be less confused.  DONT IGNORE THE ONLINE HOMEWORK, i know it's only 2% of your grade but you'll get brownie points for effort and i swear if i hadnt done them i probably would have gotten a c inthe class.  Everything in this class is extremely calculated by CHEMISTS, people who know how to be very calculated.  nothing that is required is superflous.  it is actually beneficial and essential.  if you dont do the homework you'll be skrewed, its as simple as that.  one little problem set a week will carry you through, you really need to learn and practice all along, there is absolutely no way to cram, even if you get the answers afterwords and practice the homework youve missed, its not the same.   Im not a science nerd nor did i get an A+ in this class, but i am telling you if you learn early on to the the work, you will get through this class and enjoy it.  Prof D. is an absolutely wonderful woman, the lab staff is too.  The material is often very interesting, and incredibly rewarding, you will probably never get such a sense accomplishment as you will after this course, and you will be eternally grateful to Prof D. for teaching you things that everyone should know about, like the fact that one cfc atom will stay in the ozone layer forever, continually destroying ozone molecules...so don't pollute.

I was disappointed with this class.  She started the first class by explaining meter, rhythm, and tonality to a class in which a majority of the students had no musical experience- she was stumped when a student proposed an unusual but legitimate rhythm in triple meter.  It seemed like the class was genuinely interested in learning about different composers, but their interest was somewhat smothered by adherence to a listening technique that concentrated on technical aspects as opposed to emphasizing the unique contributions each made.  The first time we listened to a piece without interruption was Beethoven's 5, but besides one day of Beethoven, it seemed like she didn't want to be in class.  She repeatedly degraded the importance of Bach and called him ""over the top"" and even claimed that minimalism creates a trance ""to make you forget life.""  Some basic facts were also incorrect, for instance she said that Mozart's Requiem was composed in 1740.  These things wouldn't have bothered me so much if she had at least let the music speak for itself without narrating pointless and sometimes mistaken musical theory during the pieces to a class that for the most part could not grasp the technical commentary.  Also, she often changes what she originally said when a student asks a specific question about what she had just explained.  This class is bearable, but I feel students who want to experience classical music should look elsewhere.

I'm so glad that's over.  This class was so bad it makes me laugh.  We freshman were eager to get to our (for some) first class at Columbia way back in September, so all of us whom were early didn't notice that the teacher was sitting there because of the awkward silence.  One student even sat next to Becky and commented on the awkward silence and Becky concurred.  What a way for the class to begin! The truth is, the class would have been even better if it were one endless awkward silence and not an attempt at another Core blunder.  In essence, University Writing seemed to have the potential of being a sometimes-decent course, but the extremely dull and nervous teaching style crushed all hopes we had.  On top of that, the grading seemed somewhat arbitrary- based on what i saw during peer-revision, some of the students in that class truly deserved to fail, but it seemed the more simple and dull or randomly novel your paper was, the better your grade would be.  My advice:  Either chose to write a very simple essay- or attempt to do something extraordinary with the topic and refrain from consciously attending the class because you will feel as though your brain is collapsing on itself.  For 2.5 classes we openly brainstormed different topics and subtopics to pursue in our groups and our final essays, but after we seemed to have narrowed down our focus to 2 very interesting topics Becky came to the next class and politely removed them on the basis that they had nothing to do with our readings and instead mustered up all of her false enthuseasm for the topic of Wall Street which turned out to be even more mind-numbing than it sounded once we devoted a month to it and which had less to do with our readings than the 2 interesting topics we had formed as a class.  At best this class is laughable. Hopefully, there will be a couple people in your class that know what they are talking about, one that sleeps with his eyes open, a few whose comments are so pointless that they are entertaining, and one whose attempts at making the class less formal are so asinine that your UW notebook becomes a collection of his quotes.

Although I sometimes dreaded the 3+ hour lab session, the 1+ hour-long lecture section delivered by Jack McGourty was fantastic.  Jack is an engaging professor with great command of the class and a down-to-earth lecture style.  His thought-provoking lecture even made the dry, generic, overidealized subject that is Gateway interesting and relevant (until I stepped out of the classroom).  He also happens to be one of those really nice people who looks at the side of the glass half full.   Even if you don't do well on some assignements or submit a homework slightly late, you'll find Jack more merciful than any of the Lab TAs.  It's very fortunate the he has the final say on your grades.
Attendance to lectures are required, and so is particpation.  These constraints are annoying but not terrible, since Jack's lecture style is very relaxed.  He shows lots of short movies and has guest speakers from every department in the Engineering School deliver overviews of their departments, during which you could snooze.
The lab session (not delivered by Jack, unfortunately) primarily teaches you Matlab and StudioTools, which are much less useful in the real world than, say, C++ and Dreamweaver.  Most people find Matlab very frustrating and StudioTools very time consuming.  You really have to hold back your feelings and pretend you love Matlab & StudioTools to do the work.  How difficult your group project is really depends on the computer programming experience of your fellow group members and how diligent they are.
Be wary!  The Gateway website says you should expect to work 4 hours per week, a VERY misleading statement.  The first few weeks of the course are fairly easy but the midterm and final projects will consume endless hours of your time.  It's actually pretty ridiculous.  I must have spent eight entire Sundays (morning til' midnight) with my team and on my own ""doing Gateway,"" time that I would have otherwise had totally free.  As the workload is so unevenly distributed throughout the semester, you shold literally start both your midterm and final projects on the very day they are posted, and even if you do it's still a rough workload.
Nevertheless, the final course grading is generous.  if you work hard, you WILL get a grade in the A range.  Think of Gateway as a straightforward test that covers a lot of material.  You'll spend an insane amount of time studying, but then you'll surely do well.  And considering that Gateway's a 4-credit class, that's a very good thing.

Having been present since approximately the birth of biochemistry  he tries to inject a little history of biochemistry into the course.  This was my favorite aspect of his teaching, although it wasn't very pronounced and was accompanied by ample name-dropping.   Aside from this, he mumbles through the material and is unnecessarily cranky.   The final is open book, but when a curve is involved all this means is that you have to spend energy memorizing where things are in the book rather than spending the same energy actually learning the material.

Unlike most reviewers, I found this class rather disappointing.  While the syllabus really is great and covers a nice batch of authors, Prof. Robbins gave little insight into the material.  He relied on the same themes and interpretations for practically every novel, making lectures very uninspiring and superficial.  To me, the strength of the course lies in the strength of the syllabus--not in Robbins' weak  and obvious analyses.  Also, beware Robbins' arrogance and the kiss-ups that eat up class time....My advice is to get the syllabus and read the books on your own.

I also can't figure out where these negative reviews are coming from.  It's true, Marwell comes across as a cold sort of person, but she *does* know her stuff, and she's not boring.  She does have students answer each others' questions, but she guides the discussion firmly and well.  The readings are, of course, dry and old, and could be boring, but she did a very good job of making them interesting and relevant.  This was one class I almost never skipped, and I'm a pretty big slacker, so that says a lot.  The only bad thing about this course were a couple of pompous assholes in it who thought they knew better than her, and obviously feel very defensive because she shot them down when they repeatedly said stupid and incorrect things during class.

The reading is hard, but there's considerably less of it than most other courses at this level.

The best part about this course is it draws a really interesting mix of wonderfully geeky students.  Discussions, while often off topic, were always thought-provoking and interesting.  You'll learn about not only Japanese monsters, but also American and European monsters, and you'll find yourself dissecting your 80s childhood frequently.  Overall a fun course.  Only annoying thing is that Pflugfelder is really spacey.  He tends to end class 10 minutes late on a regular basis - either that or 10 minutes early.  He's very easy to talk into extensions or changing due dates, which can be a bad thing when you realize that he's pushed things so far back that they're all due at once.

There's a HUGE amount of reading, but you don't have to do even close to all of it.  Read some of it, enough to do your twice-weekly online bulletin board posting.  Class discussions are so often off-topic that you can contribute all the time without having read much of anything.  That said, many of the readings are interesting, so if you have time to read them, you'll probably enjoy them.  A few readings (such as Kappa) are essential, but he'll make that obvious during class.  He assigns three short papers and one long paper.  You don't have to take notes as you are never tested on in-class material, but he grades on participation, so it's a good idea to go to class frequently.

I agree with most of the positive reviews below.  I want to add that I took this course to fulfill a general requirement and I am in no way a film major and knew nothing about film prior to the course, and I loved it.  You can pick and choose what to take away from this course.  For my midterm and finals I was able to analyze the films as literature, or socially or politically, and I didn't need to learn much about camera angles or lighting or the Deconstructor or any of that weird stuff that only Film majors like.  (Though I could have learned this stuff if I had wanted to, simply by not zoning out when he talked about it during class.) Don't be scared away from this course if you're not a Film major!

This course is co-taught by Pollack and Joe Loizzo.  I agree with the below review, Pollack's lectures were good and clear, however, he wasn't really interested in student input (although on the first day, he made it sound like he was excited about the diversity of student backgrounds and potential discussion - don't be misled!).  He and Loizzo just wanted to argue with each other in front of an audience.
The course is mainly philosophical and religious texts.

This course is co-taught by Loizzo and Robert Pollack.  I found Loizzo to be the worse of the two professors.  For a Buddhist, he had quite the ego!  It often seemed as though he were trying to convert everyone to Buddhism.  It's OK to be excited and happy with your religion, but I didn't sign up for this course to get preached at.
Loizzo gets VERY defensive when challenged.  it's difficult to say anything in response to his lectures, because he just wants to tell you you are wrong and shoot down your ideas.  (He is quite interested in hearing Pollack critique his arguments, though.  Pollack and Loizzo, in general, take each other seriously and do not take student contributions seriously at all.  They interpret student comments during class not as contributions to the discussions, but as requests for clarification of their much more important ideas.)  His religion=good/peaceful while secular society=bad/violent bias is really clear and really disgusting.

    Olick is an intelligent, witty and energetic lecturer.  Between the interesting subject matter and his own style, including some funny annecdotes, you will never be bored in this class.  Of course, this may also be due to the fact that you will be frantically scribbling notes for the entire hour and a quarter.  For me, this did not at all detract from my enjoyment of the class, and i would reccomend it almost unreservedly to anyone. As a bonus, it is obvious that despite the fact that he teaches the class repeatedly, he isn't bored either.
   Some advice:  First, while he may seem like a hardcase at times, he does make exceptions if you give him a really good reason.  Second, trust his structure and the topics in the syllabus, take REALLY good, fast notes (learn shorthand?) and cross reference them, and go to the review sessions, and you are golden.

I pretty much agree with the other reviewers in that it's a pretty bad idea to take this class. It *could* have been a cool course (most of the readings were really interesting), but for Professor Andrade, who killed everything potentally worthwhile about the material. She would come to class with no particular agenda for the discussion and instead simply ask what we didn't understand about the reading. Then she would individually answer expository questions about the readings for two hours. Class discussions were really inane and *really* boring-- anyone who tried to bring some form of critical/analytical thought to the discussion would usually be shut down (I was once informed that my reaction to a text was ""inappropriately strong"" when I tried to boost the discussion a bit). I didn't find her particularly intimidating, but I think she terrified a lot of the freshmen. She does put you on the spot-- so beware if you haven't done the reading. The paper topics spell out exactly what she wants you to do in your essay so there's zero room for creativity. 
There's too much reading, and too many pointless summaries. Also, the class is totally disjointed-- I don't think Andrade tried to establish any kind of conceptual coherence to the course, so it's a little tricky to figure out what you're supposed to know and how it relates to everything else. 
All in all, I didn't think this class was particularly difficult; however, the effort required is certainly not worth what you get out of it. If you care at all about what you're learning in your major culture classes, skip African cultural studies and take something that lets you use your brain a bit.

Despite the 9:00 start, Professor Hart's lectures were always fun and interesting.  He taught us a lot of material but did it in a way that was fun (Sienfeld clips flawlessly weaved into his powerpoint presentations, etc.).  The three tests he gave were very fair because he gave us study guides for each one.  The weekly quizes were fair too, if you did the reading.  Most of the other reviews for Professor Hart were negative, which was suprising because most students seemed to really like him.

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!! The only explanation for why there are some positive reviews of this class is because Galanter USED TO curve each individual quiz grade, and then curve at the end.  Now he ONLY curves the grades at the end of the semester, but it isn't very much help since the quizzes are IMPOSSIBLE. I went to every single class, took copious notes, and did a fair amount of reading. However, NONE of that helps you out on what I've decided are prank quizzes.  Guessing does not help you on the quizzes either, so there's no way out. I do not know ANYONE who received a good grade in this course.  I ended up Pass/Failing as a senior (who needed to knock off the sciecne requirement) b/c of the grades I got on the first two quizzes.

This is what happens when you hire a researcher without any experience in teaching and ask him/her to teach a really tough class.  Prof Aprile is a nice lady but a terrible teacher.  I went into this class loving physics, especially that I had gotten straight 100s in high school honors physics, but that all changed after this class.  Every week less and less students showed up for the lectures.  I tried to go to most lectures but ended up doing my chem lab report like a lot of other people.  She basically does the same sample problems in the book and mumbles somethings to herself as she's doing them.  A lot of times she wastes class time by talking about how she got a ticket from the cops for speeding, or how she loves to drive fast.  The only people who did well in her class were people who had already taken both AP physics in high school and had done well in them.  Anyway I haven't heard good things about the other 1401 teacher either so I'm afraid you have to make a choice between a bad and a worse.

Professor Wylie is easily one of the most approachable professors I've had in my four years at Columbia.  She certainly knows her subjects backwards and forwards.  Being a classically trained analytic philosopher, her approach toward Women's Studies tends to be more toward inquiry and epistemology within that discipline.
One thing about Professor Wylie, however, is that she likes to talk.  She can completely dominate discussion within a class and that tends to cut down on the time for participation.  Additionally, that propensity toward lecturing also comes at the cost of potentially interesting discussion, because if you're into Feminist Theory and/or Philosophy of Science, etc, they're subjects that greatly benefit from discussion.
All in all, however, Professor Wylie is a great professor to take; she's an expert in her field, and there is very little chance that you'll ever get to take a class with a feminist philosopher of science again, so your time in class with Professor Wylie is well spent.

I had mixed feelings about this class but overall I'd say it was a good class.  Prof Cao is a very nice man, but I did not rely so much on his teachings than I did on my own high school calc experience to get me through the course.

If you want a guaranteed A for working hard then take his class.

Janet Jakobsen really is a fantastic professor, and if you're interested in feminist theory, ethics, or social movements, there are really few better or more qualified people on this campus to take class with.  
Perhaps the best facet of taking a class with Janet is that she has an amazing ability to take extremely complex theoretical concepts and break them down into very palatable language.  She continually emphasizes the importance of doing the reading, but she will not fault you if you have problems understanding it; rather she'll take as much time as you need to get it clear.
Additionally, she's fantastically dry and sarcastic, and her humor really keeps the class environment light and enjoyable, although you're always dealing with some heavy concepts.

 She is an interesting teacher to those students not having prior knowledge of Latin American culture and history. But to me she at first seemed interesting but towards the end she bored with her numerous classes dedicated to poetry and art which led the class to Bulls**t the last part of the semester.  Her exams confused students as they are deceptively easy yet are graded from a 95 scale and not a hundred thus a student is automatically penalized 5 points. She says she does it to compensate for students  obtaining an A+, but this only discourages students once their grades are lowered due to this grading system. The presentations by students were an unnecessary component of the class or need to be retuned as most students simply repeated common knowledge about works without any real analysis. These presentations dragged on for too long, sometimes more than an hour, thus causing many students to loose interest in the class and sleep. Her lack of organization of materials leads students to not know which assignments are due on which dates. Her feminist left wing liberal stance on numerous issues makes you feel as if you were at times taking feminist 101 or left wing politics. Avoid this class if you are easily bored.

Filling in a map of india doesnt sound hard, but just wait till you get a full point off for every time you place a city slightly to the right or left of where she wants it. At the end of your papers she'll make charts to show you what points you could have elaborated on, and take off full grades for nit-picky areas not covered. Her final is a KILLER, and requires days of reading week to prepare for. You need to know 70/73 identifications, memorize that darn map and all of indian art history, plus prepare 7 full essays. Overall, she is a wonderful and engaging lecturer, but im not so sure that makes it worth drowning all semester for a mediocre grade. I must say, however, that she does an excellent job in presenting a thorough introduction to indian civilization both for people who know a lot about the region and people with no substantial background. 
Workload:
a killer final, (memorize 70 IDs, the entire map of india + be able to identify all slides ever shown in the course, and about 7 essays you need to prepare ahead of time). two 7 page papers which she'll grade with a fine tooth comb. LOTS of readings which you'll have to do for the papers, but can lag behind for in the lectures.

All too often during Vandenburg's lectures---which all too often degenerated into maddeningly idiotic (and maddeningly unchecked) pontifications by students---I found myself shrieking inside my head, ""I AM NOT PAYING THREE GRAND A CLASS SO THAT I CAN SPEND THREE HOURS A WEEK RELIVING A HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH CLASS.""  Because, in too many ways, that's what Vandenburg's class was.
Sure, Vandenburg cites plenty of Classical and poststructuralist references, offering links to other thinkers and writers--but too often, the links offered seem either arbitrary or obvious (more often the latter; how many times do the names of Freud, Jung, and Lacan really need to be cited a la some Modernist sign of the Cross?).  Sure, she has a good sense of facilitating discussion--but too often, she lets students rattle off countless inane questions and comments.
An important thing to note about Vandenburg's Modernism class is that at first it sounds damn promising: she's a lively but approachable lecturer, she asks and answers questions, and she tries to bridge disciplines.  But after attending more than a few classes, you'll realize how damn reductive her whole process is.  For the most part, the class is an extensive list of buzz words bandied about in a dangerously general fashion.  The same names, sooner or later, will crop up in just about every class, as will general mention of gender, tradition, and duality.
That's all well and good, yes, but after a point, Vandenburg doesn't really go anywhere with them.  She makes general, digestible, and really very obvious assertions by way of grossly reductive drawings on the blackboard:  ""light"" and ""good"" go under ""presence,"" ""dark"" and ""bad"" under ""absence,"" etc.  It's sheer high school-level simplification that might prove useful were Vandenburg to use it to prove some larger point---but unfortunately, those larger points rarely come along.  Instead, you're left with a series of general ideas about the major players of High Modernism that in no way do their respective works justice and that leave you with juvenile assignments.  (For instance, paper assignments that are far too far-reaching to fit into the short page-lengths allotted to them.  Oh, and the topic for the essay on the final:  ""What is Modernism?""  Ha.)  Not only that, but I got the distinct impression that Vandenburg -wanted- things that way.  When I went in to her office hours to discuss a possible topic I'd come up with for my research paper, she immediately discouraged me, telling me it would be too difficult and suggesting I try a safer topic.  Uh, since when are professors supposed to encourage students NOT to take intellectual risks?
If you want to go in-depth in Modernist novels at all and not spend an entire class period leaping from generalizing statements about a work/author (i.e., ""Woolf's writing is cubistic!  Joyce likes epiphany!"") to ineffectual nitpicking (""look, it's another example of Eliot's obsession with tradition!""), then Vandenburg's Modernism is not the class to take.  If you're totally new to Modernism, though, and just want a general overview, the class could be beneficial.

I think Adams is an exceedingly nice guy who relates and cares about students.  He has a relaxed, approachable manner that put me at ease.  He's also  really smart, which means he sometimes leaves a class in the dark without realizing it.  At the end of the semester, he insisted that people who had 2 other exams take all 3 one the same day - a mistake in my opinion.  It pissed a lot of people off, so I think there's some bad blood there.  But his exams and grading were extraordinarily fair in my opinion.

I've been to both ends of it with this guy so I feel capable of giving a good evaluation.  What I mean is that I hated this class for the first 4 or 5 weeks.  There's something about him that drove me crazy.  The other reviewers are right, he won't know you name, and he can go on and on.  He has this particular way of looking at art that drove me crazy.  I wanted passion and meaning and interpretation!  I mean hey, this is art right!  On top of that he uses words like 'coiffure' and 'conflagration' in ordinary conversation.  Like, I know what they mean, but can't you just say 'hair' and 'fire?'
BUT - he really turned it around for me.  I got over 'my' way of looking at art.  He got me to look at it from a new standpoint, something more basic, that relied on what you could actually see versus what I felt I saw.  It was an enlightening exercise and I feel like my relationship to art deepened several notches by the end of the course. 
I guess what I want to say is, this guy actually taught me something, even though our personalities clashed at first.  That's pretty cool in my book.

Instead of reading every night, she instead encourages students to ""look"" at the paintings to understand them on a personal level.  It's great.

Erin likes to teach, and she wants you to enjoy the class as much as possible. This, I think, best summarizes my impression of her from the semester, and I think that's very important to making the class bearable. The problem is that learning a language can be confusing, overwhelming, and flat out difficult. Erin cares about the details, like spelling and pronunciation, that can make the class a bit more tedious in the shortterm, but it seems to me that an insistence on caring about those things is important for actually learning the language (and preparing you for more advanced classes, assuming you're taking it for the language requirement, like I am). For example, if a student reading a response to an exercise omits an elision or liason or mispronounces a vowel, she will prod the student until he or she pronounces the word correctly. Her grading is similarly demanding.
The only thing is that since it is her enthusiasm and energy that keeps the class going, if she runs out of steam for whatever reason (in particular, I can't imagine it is easy to keep up that kind of pace in front of a tired, impatient group of students for 1 hour 15 minutes on a friday afternoon) the class starts to seriously drag. This only happened a few times throughout the semester, and less towards the end when we started to understand what she was saying more and so were more involved.
She is serious about running the class in french except for grammatical concepts, housework type thing, and when students are completely, totally, and irreparably confused. She doesn't require students to try to ask question in french (at this level that would have been pretty much impossible).

Professor Sanchez was friendly and for the most part, well-prepared.  As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, he's interesting on a personal level because he is very involved in local politics, and knows a great deal about what's going on in the world today.  Unfortunately, his lectures are frenetic and disorganized and extremely boring.  He likes to overuse terms like ""optic"" and ""vis-a-vis"" as sentence fillers which become increasingly annoying as the semester rolls on.
Attendance (and reading) is absolutely, positively, unnecessary.  I did not do any of the required readings, and went to only 5 class meetings, but ended up with a 95%.  This is possible because all the work is take-home, and answers for midterm/final questions can be gleaned from your own background knowledge, or just from skimming a couple of the readings a day or two before the assignment is due.
From what I have heard, this class was much better when Robert Smith taught it.

I'm an Urban Studies major, but it was definitely not this class that ""cemented"" my decision as another reviewer wrote.  Gutfreund takes his lectures directly from the readings so there's no point in going to class.  He thinks he's being helpful by writing the list of the five or ten largest cities every decade and their populations on the blackboard when you could look at the tables in the books and find the exact same stuff only better organized.  
I stopped going to this class mid-way through, and didn't do the readings.  He said to the class the day before the final: ""You know, if you skipped the last 2 months of this class you're not going to get an A.""  This is hilarious because when he said this, I thought he was talking just to me .  . . but I still got an A in the class.  Don't take this class if you want to hear a nuanced approach to cities; take it only if you know nothing about cities and want a large lecture class and 3 easy credits.

Professor Cole's classes are not for amateurs.  He has tremendous ability and intelligence and is clearly highly respected within the department, but for those who aren't supremely motivated and already well-versed in physics, this class will be a nightmare (assuming you don't drop it).
The (lengthy) review before this one is pretty much spot on, in the following respects:
- Problem sets take a LONG time, and if you don't attend class and keep up with the material religiously, you will find yourself playing a continuous game of catch-up from which it is very hard to recover.
- This past semester he used no book, and no TA.  This meant we were entirely dependent on him and his limited time schedule (remember, he's a big-shot professor) to answer any and all of our questions.  And no book to pore over, not until the last few weeks when we started into the actual ""quantum mechanics"" of the course
- The course spends 3/4s of its time on waves and the mathematical tools needed to analyze different types and consequences of waves.  Be prepared for matrix algebra and eigenvectors, Fourier analysis, partial differential equations, and so forth.
-- moreover, if you haven't taken classes that cover these subjects before or aren't taking them concurrently, you're pretty much f'd.  Prof. Cole will, of course, assure you that any math background you need will be amply covered in class, a promise he forgets as he blazes through the lectures, skipping steps and assuming knowledge willy-nilly.
- Our class started out with roughly 60 people and dwindled to 35 through drops - and these were among the people who felt confident enough on 1601/1602 to try their hand at a tougher physics course.  Many people stopped going to class even if they were going to stick it out through the semester, simply because if they hadn't heard the previous 5 lectures, they wouldn't understand the current one.  The barrier to catching-up is absolutely enormous, and Professor Cole's office hours are generally dominated by fawning nerds who ask pedantic questions, show off their own mastery of the material, and sneer at those of us who legitimately are having trouble.
In Cole's defense, I did get the sense that he was genuinely interested in helping his students succeed.  Indeed, he often devoted long office hours on Fridays to answering questions, and would push back deadlines if it was necessary.  (He would also accept stuff late if you didn't make a big deal about it).  However, the disorganization of the class and the many unorthodox decisions Cole made in setting it up (no TA, no textbook, insane problem sets, no ability to catch up...) combined to make this an altogether miserable experience.
Cole's really a nice guy though.  Seriously.
Workload:
painful.  problem sets took me 30 hours a week (yes, i'm not kidding), although most people could do them in half that, and the true experts probably spent 6-10 hours on them.  Midterms are fair but challenging, as is the final.  Cut class at your GPA's peril!

Professor Biliris is really not as bad as all that.  I will concede that he is an extremely boring lecturer; however, one of my friends who is among the smartest people I have ever met was able to go to class and pick up everything from the lectures and never even had to open the book.  Apparently, that was his goal with the lectures (to be a substitute for the book), and it didn't bother him at all when people just got up and left class.
As has been mentioned, he is a very easy grader, although the homework assignments are designed a little thoughtlessly.  Generally speaking, the portions of the assignment that take 80%+ of the time spent coding are the parts that are irrelevant to the material being taught by the homework.  For example, the homework assignment involving trees and hierarchies was easy enough conceptually, but the mechanics of getting the applet to display the way you wanted were a royal pain in the posterior.  This shows inexperience and some obliviousness.
However, the man isn't uncaring.  A little begging post-thanksgiving convinced him to extend the deadline of one of the homework assignments, and he seems very approachable and eager to help.  Plus he's got that cute little Greek accent, which is always good for something.
An average teacher overall, in Columbia terms.

Sherri introduced herself as a graduate (or PhD, i don't remember) student, coming from Hunter College, and that she was essentially a film professor.
Her grasp of teaching English was fairly good, and she led the classroom discussions pretty well.  Personally she was more than a little quirky, but listened well and was always very deferential to student ideas.  She was more than willing to go the extra step to help students (and in fact, going and spending some time with her at her favorite place, Avery cafeteria, almost certainly assures you a better grade on the next paper).
One element of her teaching style that deserves further comment is her seeming blind devotion to the principles of militant feminism.  Many of you may think there's nothing wrong with that; however, she approaches any book from a feminist perspective, trying to get people to see the role of women (or the lack thereof) as some sort of central theme.  News flash: the Iliad is intentionally devoid of substantive female characters, and the sooner she realizes this the less uncomfortable class will feel.  Realize that this was little more than an annoyance, because after she tried discussing a particular book from a feminist tack, she would happily yield the subject of conversation back to the students who had more perceptive things to talk about.
She would occasionally try to pepper the class with outside background information on the text, giving us, say, a chronology of The Histories by Herodotus or a summary of what is known about the authors of the Bible.  More often than not, however, these were completely useless.
On the whole, Sherri Wolf is a ""do no harm"" kind of professor.  Given the number of horror stories I have heard, I would consider hers to be a very mild case of incompetence, and in any case, she means well and is very humble.
Workload:
the standard lit hum: huge amounts of reading, 3 essays for the semester (she made it 2), midterm and final which are primarily essay-based.

The best course I've taken so far at college with the best teacher I've had so far at college. Do NOT miss McDermott. Not only is she a great lecturer (organized, straight to the point, engaging, versatile with teaching media, open to questions, conversation, and criticism) but she makes sure all the material is relevant. You will learn a lot, and you don't even have to do all the reading. Just get the gist of whatever, or even read it after she's lectured (she covers everything in there anyway). But you'll want to do the reading, maybe not in the beginning when its ancient and obscure, but as the course progresses so does its momentum. McDermott is interesting, knows her stuff (and if she doesn't she'll ask the TA's, the students, or look it up and admit she doesn't know). It's a moderate amount of work, and the final is hard but not impossible, and when you finish you feel like you really know some stuff and have real, applicable opinions about things. Take it, do half or more of the reading. Don't miss McDermott if this is a subject that interests you. And if you're good, you'll find a mentor.

I had mixed feelings about Prof. Crapotta. He had a big personality, was entertaining, (and loves to be entertained, don't forget that for ANY assignment; make him laugh and pay attention to your grammar and accent and he's yours), but seemed distant at first. Don't be scared; by the end of the semester, I grew to love him and the whole class. We learned from every possible source of Spanish, and the class is more work and time than you probably expect from a Spanish class, but it's not busy work, and it's not wasted. You'll get better and more comfortable with Spanish, and he'll have you speaking more fluidly by the end of the semester. Smile, pay attention (not hard except during grammar days), laugh, and make him do the same during your (many) presentations (mostly fun skits). I used to hate working in groups; now I miss my class. In short, Crapotta is great if you just match his personality.

As everyone knows, the language classes at Barnard are harder and better than those at Columbia with maybe some exceptions. Anyway, this course was definitely challenging, since it forces you to do lots of annoying stuff in French, the grading of which has no clear basis (ex. we had to write a resume in French, and were graded on the format and presentation of what we did instead of how the French was; we had to make ads in French and were graded by how the thing looked more than if it was correct). If you have great French, you'll get B's and B+'s unless you pair that with an eye for detail (aesthetic and grammatical) and some sort of flash/ hook for your subject (ex. make your final presentation fun, and she'll forget all about your French). She doesn't want this class to be boring, though you can space out through a lot of it. She knows her stuff, and speaks French as a native (finally!). She also seems a little too put together, but she really just wants to feel like a part of a group instead of a teacher. The fact that there was no midterm or final (not even oral interviews) was great because by the end of the semester we were just having fun. You'll spend most of the classes just talking about something she handed out. Take the course to keep your French from slipping and use this unique, small, conversational centerpiece to develop your speaking skills. You won't get amazing, but you'll get better.

I'm surprised there aren't any reviews of Alexa yet - she was responsible for the most useless, boring and frustrating Latin experience I've ever had.  While the material - poetry central to the Latin ""canon"" - was fine, class was a mess:  we very rarely discussed literary features of the poems, or their historical circumstances, focusing instead on translating each poem with as little efficiency as possible.  Worse still, Alexa was extremely insecure and nervous;  she claimed she was not a poetry specialist and showed quite clearly, by constant grammatical mistakes and total ignorance metrical rules, that this was true.  (Why she was assigned to teach the course, considering all the unemployed academics out there who could have done a better job, baffled our class the semester through.)  Our TA was very good, and even dealt well with Alexa's obvious resentment at the fact that he often needed to correct her grammar or history.

I would have perhaps used the word loved had the other reviews not been so harshly critical.  Let first say a few things -- yes, there is quite a bit of reading, and yes, the reading is hard. But, Andrade is a very thoughtful woman who knows an incredible amount of information in her field.  She's a typical college professor in that you can tell her focus is more on research taking place outside the classroom, but she is also enormously kind and genuine.  She is writing a book about a film and several books we handled in lecture, is fluent in french, and is able to answer almost any obscure question you could have regarding African civilization.

Unfortunately I have to agree with the reviewers who gave poor reviews to this class.  Our class was the guinea pig class as this is the first time it's ever been taught.  As a result she assembled an overly ambitous syllabus which meant that not only did we have to cut out several readings and assignments, but that we had to purchase $20 books in order to only read an introduction that could have been photocopied and paying way too much for course packs that had a number of untouched articles.  In addition there she considerably increased the number of written assignments without really giving us any feedback or constructive criticism in order to improve on our next papers (that is if we got them back before we had to write the next paper).  The first test in the class was the final which she did little to no work helping us to prepare for.  When asked questions about what would be expected of us all she could say was that she hadn't really decided what the test would be like and that we should therefore just ""know everything.""  The main text, Africa since 1940, is bearable until the fifth chapter at which point it becomes a mind-numbing list of facts.  To make it worse, the professor acknowledged that the last half of the book was indeed terrible before revealing to us that she had not in fact read the whole book before assigning it to us.  
I also have to agree with the fact that she wasn't an engaging professor.  While I was under the impression that it would be a lecture class it turned into a seminar discussion period which primarily consisted of Professor Andrade asking us what we didn't understand about the reading and proceeding to stare at us for the remainder of the class until someone came up with a question, which would then take her at least 10 minutes to respond to.  There was no stimulation in this class.  I felt as if she didn't come to class with a lesson plan or agenda and therefore the conversation often became stale and sometimes non-existant.  Like a previous reveiwer mentioned, whenever someone would try to bring up a controversial point, the professor would cut that person off claiming that we could not discuss the issue until everyone's questions had been answered and we fully understood the text, which, judging by the lack of questions, we already did.  
The readings are difficult but interesting.  However I do not feel that the professor chose the best manner in which to discuss the points and arguments presented in the readings, and therefore many people got little more out of them than they had by simply reading them on their own time.  Overall I would say that the material is interesting but the class's lack of stimulation makes it a waste of time.

Oh, those red boots. Oh, that pumpkin hair. Oh, her references to ""inhaling."" Rosamond comprises everything you'd ever imagine in a religion Ph.D. student teaching CC and more. At first coming off as a slightly disaffected, yogaed-out Seattle expat, she impresses with her knowledge of the Bible and of her keen sense of chronology, influence and intertextual relevance. Sure, she may seem like a relativist, and sure it is annoying as hell when she won't let you use any gender-specific terms (""craftsmanship,"" ""statesman""), but she is accessible, friendly, unpredictable and oh-

Give it a rest, guys. This sudden outburst of defense for Marwell fingers you as those ""pompous assholes"" who dominated (and yes, I'll admit, ruined) the class. Let's just stick to the facts. Compared to the rest of the Sociology department, Marwell stands out for her rigid, cold, and yes, boring approach to Sociology. And yes, I know that such material as this is hard to make completely enthralling, but believe it or not, I've seen it done.
What gets me about Marwell is her own foolish idea that she has the ""right"" answer when it comes to this stuff, when in fact they boil down to more than one. I also agree that she was never so detailed as when she told the life stories of the various authors; and can anyone say that that last unit about current Columbia professors per the Classical authors was NOT a waste of time?
Good professors require good rapport and overall passable social skills when it comes to their students and the communication of their lessons. Marwell doesn't have any of that, doesn't even come close, so that automatically requires the less-than-fawning reviews you will find from those students bright and brave enough to post them. For those calling all of us ""pricks"" and other such nonsense, I would say that you have made yourself look more of one than we have. These reviews are supposed to reflect upon the teacher, and not berrate other reviewers.
Overall, don't take this class if you don't have to. And if you do, dno't be surprised by your average grades.
Workload:
Lots of reading that is essentially pointless, weekly quizzes. If you've taken Imagination, and hopefully you have, as well as CC, those notes will tell you everything you need to know to answer the quizzes and will fill you in on everything that Marwell won't.
Take-home midterm (graded quite arbitrarily), as well as a long-winded final that makes no sense and only requires that you nearly break your hand. Doesn't matter what you write; unless she writes it, or you took verbatim notes in class, it's not gonna get a perfect score.

I saw all the horrible reviews and I thought ""I'll give this professor a shot.""  I regretted that almost immediately.  I agreee with all of what others have said about this class.  It's not really that hard, in fact I managed a B without really reading the textbook or coming to the last month of class (that's how little the materials helped me).  But easy doesn't mean bearable.
The first major problem is that he wrote the textbook...but never finished it.  As a result there are constant references to chapters, graphs, and pictures that don't exist.  Even my TA said that it was one of the worst introductory psychology books he's ever seen.  To top it off his power point lectures either serve to repeat the book verbatim or directly contradict it.  Often in discussion sessions our TA would end up having to reteach certain parts of the lecture because what was said simply didn't make sense to anyone.

This class is pretty boring. The material, in general, is not, but the teaching is dull. If you're interested in the topic, take this as your fifth class because you don't really have to do a damn thing. You could do the reading, but there isn't really a point. His lectures are almost always summaries of the reading without much insight or perspective added. The midterm and final are essay question which you can select from a list of about 10 questions. Conveniently, the questions all correlate to the lecture topics, and a regurgitation of the main points will certainly suffice.

Mr. Trask's class was certainly not enjoyable, nor do I feel I learned much, but overall, it was an easy A (and the whole thing could've been worse). His class discussions were often frustrating and boring, but they certainly weren't difficult-- you could easily get away with sitting in a corner silently for most of class, perhaps spouting off a few lines of BS if absolutely neccessary (I do think, however, he boosted the grades of those students who participated readily in discussion). He was very anal about getting the early class assignments in on time; in fact, he was quite rude about them. His attitude was often difficult to endure, but if you can manage to maintain your composure, he generally settles down and behaves. He really got into our class' research paper; he even took us on a field trip that was fairly enjoyable. Despite his poor assignments, which were generally vague, not offering the student much direction, he was a fair grader. Although he was not very nice about coming in outside of his office hours (if you have another class at that time), if you did manage to meet with him frequently, he would help you with your paper and, as a result, give you a higher grade. In short, endure him with grace, play his games, and your experience will be bearable...

This course was probably the most postive course evaluation I have ever filled out: the material is fascinating and Professor Cole is spectacular! 
The course is physics the way it is supposed to be, starting with F=ma and step-by-step deriving harmonic motion, coupled oscillators, classical waves, fourier analysis, electromagnetic waves, and, finally , elementary quantum mechanics.  Almost without exception Professor Cole teaches the material the way that it must be taught for a physcist to understand, which brings me to the first caveat:
this course is for PHYSICISTS, NOT engineers!  repeatedly i heard engineering students complaining about the lack of applications and the formalism of the material; well sorry guys but that is what 1403 is for.  This course has a lot to cover, essentially needing to bring up-and-coming physics majors from the introductory level to being able to take 4021 graduate quantum mechanics next year (which is the recommended path for majors), and even with extra classes and extremely generous recitations and office hours by professor Cole we still did not do some of the later material justice.  
Given that Professor Cole lives two hours away and works at Brookhaven, he was absolutely great about coming in for extra sessions to help us, sacrificing many hours of his time to help the often-small numbers of students that attended the extra sessions.  He was also exceptionally open to quesions not directly pertaining to the material, for example after the final talking to several of us about the strong force and super-symmetry for at least 45 minutes.  
Some students have complained about the lack of a textbook, but I found that Professor Cole's lectures notes were wonderful at getting to the heart of the material without the unecessary frills in most newer texbooks...  He provides us with several chapters from the French quantum book for background reading and recommends buying the French wave book as well. His handmade problem sets are terrific. 
It is only fair to mention that the class is rather disorganized, with due dates and extra lectures being added and changing willy-nilly and the changes (usually) being posted on Cole's website.  This creates a fun casual atmosphere, but it is also irritating at times.  
Ultimately, this course is not for slacker engineering students wanting an easy A, but for anyone who loves physics it is a must-take experience that will change the way you think about and do physics for the rest of your time here.

problem sets are a blast, but rather time-consuming.  usually are somewhere inbetween 5-10 hours a week.  tests are inherently not that difficult, but i had a real problem running out of time...

This is a really decent class; consider it the ""intro for humanities students"" version of intro astro.  I went into this class to satisfy my sci req., but found that the subject really grabbed me, and now hope to pursue some more astro classes.
Prof. Kay is great.  She is bright and laid-back, and really enjoys teaching the subject matter.  She's really into sci-fi stuff so plan to watch some hilarious old sci-fi movie clips, and find tabloids and cartoons on her class website.
Attendance, except for quizzes and exams of course, is not really necessary.  Her lectures are posted on Courseworks, so you can just look at those or print them out ahead of time so you don't have to write anything during class. That said, you'll probably want to go anyways just to go, but dont feel bad if you miss a week or two.
All in all, take this class.  It's fairly painless, interesting, and a solid introduction to astro. (there's a big curve gradewise, too).  In terms of prep., need basic high school algebra, and it helps to have exposure to high school chem and physics.
A few notes:
1. You can def take this class out of sequence, (ie II before I), and in fact, I'd recommend it because once you've got II done, I is a breeze. 
2. Nobody really knows whether to take Patterson's class or Kay's; I've heard people say conflicting things-- they are pretty equivalent though in terms of being intro for non-science people. Main difference is that Patterson's semester 1 is Earth, Moon, Planets, while Kay's is Life in the Universe.  Second semester classes are parallel.
3. Lab (if you take it) is more in-depth/difficult than lecture and doesnt parallel the lecture, but its decent, too.  4. Labs are fine if you have to take them; there is no outside work, and there are no real graded assignments-- mostly its participation.  That said, participation is key-- this is sometimes tough since all labs meet at night so youll be tired-- they meet at night so can use telescopes on the roof.

I mostly agree with what's been said by earlier reviewers, but wanted to point out some ways in which the class was different in the fall of '03 compared to earlier years:
Professor Feiner makes extensive use of powerpoint nowadays, as well as videos, some overhead slides, etc. The powerpoint slides aren't especially comprehensible in isolation, though; when reviewing for the midterm, have the notes in one window and google open in another to look up terms that aren't explained directly on the slides.
Apart from that, I don't feel like I really learned the vocabulary and concerns of interface designers working in industry; the class focused more on academic UI research, past and present. I plan to redress this by doing a fair amount of independent reading this term.
Workload:
I found the programming workload for the course to be staggering. Part of this can be attributed to the lack of written problem sets or assignments that were strictly design assignments; for all four we had to handle design _and_ implementation. The first three assignments built on each other (though the final project was unrelated), but assignments 2 and 3 both required significant reworkings of and extensions to what came before. I don't think that an advanced undergraduate course should require its students to produce more than 2000 original lines of code or so, and I wrote much, much more than that.

First of all this class is not for the faint of heart (see workload) Anders Stephanson takes this class seriously and expects as much of his students. On the bright side he is ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS in his own dry way, he will make you guffaw in the middle of a lecture on Kennan. Stephanson is also highly intelligent and has a supreme grasp of his subject. He spices his lectures with words of his own creation (I like to think of them as Stephansonisms) has a wild look in his eyes, occasionally humps the desk for emphasis, and keeps bursting into spastic sticulations, all this just adds to the Stephanson experience. He is without a doubt one of the best professors I've had at Columbia. I learnt an enourmous amont from this class, partly due to the fact  that the reading list is nothing if not brutal (although far from impossible, I actually managed to keep up with the reading.) On the final and in the papers, he expects you to have a good grasp of not only events but different historiographical strains of thought. This is not a class for those of you who want to sit back and take it easy.

First of all, the above review was just inaccurate - the class spent only 2 or 3 weeks on history. Secondly, the reading list was a who's who of Chinese scholarship - while isssues were examined from several different angles much of the time, occasionally only one article was included b/c the author offered the best analysis of the issue.  This class is not for someone who wants an intro to comparative politics, nor is it for someone who is just looking to cover a major cultures. Domestic Politics very often deal w/dry issues, so be prepared if you aren't fascinated by Chinese environmental policy. While Economy is definitely not a seasoned lecturer, her teaching style is simple and straightforward - probably the result of having been trained to brief politicians and diplomats at the CIA. That being said, she is very generous with her time and encourages students to email, call and visit her with questions or comments. All in all, a great class if you are interested in the material.

Brilliant.  Inspiring.  Brutally sarcastic.  That's exactly what comes to mind when I hear Professor Eisner's name.  Talk about a guy that knows what he is doing.  The downside of that, however, is that HE knows it as well.  He is not afraid to let you know what he thinks, not just of your writing and comments in general, but also what he thinks of other professors.  He knows that he's a good teacher, and tends to remind his students of it through his caustic comments.
Eisner will teach you abundantly, and teach you well, but it requires hard work and dedication on the students' part.  He assigns a million essays and books that aren't on the required reading list (on top of the required, of course).  The three essays assigned are short but must be incredibly in-depth (and believe me, you can't bulls**t this guy).  In short, if you are expecting an easy A, run.

Flora is colorful and loud, and tends to be a bit ""spacey"" as another reviewer mentioned.  Her class is embarassingly easy; she frequently pares down the syllabus and she never checks workbook exercises. Her quizzes are fair, and even if you get B's on them you'll end up with an A because of ""participation"" and, well, because everyone gets an A with Flora.
She may lose your assignments which is annoying, but you can always just bring in another copy later on.  She accepts things late, too.  A large component of the grade is how perky you seem in class and how much over-acting you do on presentations and the final skit.  Also, be prepared to shower her with praises.  Seriously, sometimes she will ask something like ""Who's the best?"" and everyone yells back ""FLORA!!!"" but this is all worth it for the easy A, random food she brings in some days, singing happy birthday to people in class, etc.

Just to counter many of the reviews, which seem to have been from people looking for an easy way to satisfy their science requirement: Mind, Brain and Behavior is a fantastic course, if you take it to be an introduction to cognitive neuroscience. Professor Mangels does an excellent job of exploring in depth a great variety of topics in a clear and interesting way. This was the course which motivated me to become a Neuroscience and Behavior major; if you're considering it at all Mangels is definitely the professor to take this class with. That said, the same reason that makes this class great for the science-inclined may make it an awful experience for those who are looking for the least painful way to satisfy their requirement. But if you're prepared to put in the effort, anyone can leave the class with some really comprehensive knowledge.

Alert! Alert! Beware of this TA! Every third week we had him TA (the three TA's were alternating) he would hold the recitation and grade the problem sets. During his recitation session he would seemingly provide a useful way to approach and solve a particular problem but then proceeded to say the same method that he outlined himself in recitation was incorrect when he later graded the problem sets. Aside from being a LIAR, this guy also made every effort to make the class miserable.

I don't agree with the previous few critics about the class.  I though that Prof. Helfand was a GREAT teacher-- funny, interesting, AND clear.  Although, I do have to admit that his problem sets were CHALLENGING, but they were definitely do-able if you were to go to his office hours.  He was available before EVERY problem set was due to answer ANY questions, and he would practically DO the problems out on the board.

It's true that the class is not the most fascinating at Columbia, but I think Lean provides a pretty comprehensive review of a massive amount of history.

Her lectures are basically straight from the book anyway.

Flynn is a really nice man, and really cares about his students. The first test was a HUGE shock, and pretty much everyone did badly, which meant that with the curve everyone was fine. When you get used to his tests, you can really learn a lot.  The recitations are pretty painful...try to get a good TA and friends in earlier recitations that can tell you what to do.  I don't  think he's teaching this class anymore, but if he does the best way to do well is find someone from the previous year and get their sample midterms...the problems on the midterm you have will probably be very similar (if not identical) to the ones on the sample midterm from the year before.

It has been my great pleasure and privilege to have known Professor Bradley for the last four years at Columbia. Although I have not taken any of her music courses, I have nevertheless heard many positive and warm remarks from her other students. 
 Luckily, however, I have come to know Professor Bradley quite well through my active involvement in the Music Performance Program as well as on the personal level in general. 
What I can say for sure is that Deborah Bradley is erudite and exciting as a professor and a pianist. She cares deeply about all of her students, dedicated to setting a high intellectual, as well as musical, standard for all, in a friendly classroom, or concert environment. Her great vision of, and passion for, music become immediately apparent not only in her pedagogical endeavors but also in her own pianistic performance as a soloist and a member of her Moebius Ensemble.
In the last four years, Deborah Bradley has dramatically enlivened and enriched the musical caliber of the MPP (Music Performance Program) by her active involvement in arranging numerous solo/chamber music concerts in such prestigious venues as the Steinway Hall, Merkin Hall, and Weill Hall at Carnegie Hall, as well as several other important locations on the Columbia campus. These concerts showcased a diverse array of musical talents from Columbia, Barnard, and Barnard-Columbia-Juilliard joint degree program. Professor Bradley has thus successfully and significantly elevated the MPP to its unprecedented musical height!
Last, but certainly not least, Deborah Bradley has a wonderful -   friendly, enthusiastic, generous - personality, not to mention a great sense of humor.  She is charismatic on both musical and personal levels. 
Deborah Bradley is great role model for all!

Dr. Mangels has had plenty of good reviews already, but given the last few, I felt I had to respond.  I found this course to be very interesting.  The nature of the course is such that the first half of the semester is mostly biology, and you may decide that this is not your cup-of-tea, but that in no way qualifies it as a boring, misguided course.  I found Dr. Mangels to be a fascinating lecturer, and I felt that she is just an amazing person.  For example, in one of her interactive experiments, one of the test words was 'terrorist.'  After the experiment, she made a side-comment that ""much later, you'll tell your grandkids that you had this experiment, and you still remember the word 'terrorist' being in it, and they'll say, 'What's a terrorist, grandpa?'  Wouldn't that be nice?""  Dr. Mangels' human side made it such a pleasure for me to learn from her.  I love you Dr. Mangels!

If you are accustomed to neat textbooks and workbook exercises that help you learn grammar and vocabulary, you will be sorely disappointed with KasheffÂ’s Persian class. Kasheff wrote the so-called textbook which is actually a disorganized bundling of class notes you must purchase from CopyQuick. Frankly, I think itÂ’s garbage. It is certainly not as user-friendly as the material you receive in the Hebrew or Arabic courses at Columbia. What one of the previous reviewers said about KasheffÂ’s personality is true. The guy is obnoxious. He has a habit of dotting over a few of his favorite students. When one of his not-so-favorite students tries to speak, he lashes out at them if they make a mistake. He also has the habit of asking students very inappropriate personal questions with the obvious intention of humiliating them.

A ++ to Deborah Bradley. Professor Bradley's course  Masterpieces of Western Music was one of the best learning experiences of my college career at Columbia. She is always interesting, informative and well- prepared. The consummate professional. Since this class is a requirement for most students, I highly recommend that you try to take it with her. The coursework and assignments are interesting and not overwhelming. In addition, Dr. Bradley is a very very fair grader- this class will definitely boost your GPA if you apply yourself.

The material in this class is often difficult and Prof. Mohler's teaching style was sometimes confusing.  However, despite it being a 9 AM class I never fell asleep.   He is a mediocre lecturer, not the worst, not the best.  But here comes the good part:  He curves around an  A!  The median grade (usually in the 70s) on all his tests were an A.  The lowest final grade he gave was a B or B-.  One student even got an A+.  His curve is the best kept secret.

OK, first of all-- I was really surprised to read the reviews posted on Professor Gill.  Yes-- she does challenge her students.  However, Gill is one of the best professors I've had at Barnard/Columbia and I cannot recommend her highly enough.  I would encourage any other student to take a class with Gill before graduating.  Give her enough time; she'll be the next Dalton.  (You heard it here first)  She's dynamic, inspired, sincere and yet still grounded.  I don't really understand how anyone could leave one of her classes without a profound respect for Gill as a person and as a professor.  This was the kind of class where you bonded with your classmates whom you never met before over how wonderful the professor was.  You got the sense that Gill is one of those people that lives her life on a fuller, richer, deeper level and this vitality permeates her classes.  As far as the issues raised in the other posts: Gill is not married to the syllabus, but is by no means disorganized-- she's just realistic and will take more or less time as needed for certain subjects.  She does have high expectations but not unrealistic ones.  This is not the kind of class that you can sleep through-- but trust me, you'll never want to.  Her classes do seem to be run more like seminars with a lot of discussion.  She's sensitive to those who are quieter, but still encourages them to participate.  There was no favoritism in my class with her.  My only complaint would be that she likes to understand her students, but can label them too quickly.  I don't think she locks into those opinions though.

He doesn't put a lot of work into this class.  All he does is take powerpoint slides provided by a textbook and present them to the class verbatim.  He gives us handouts of these slides, so it makes this 2.5 hours class so boring.
He is the WORST grader I've ever known.  He grades exams on a relative basis.  This means that if your answer doesn't match what the rest of the class wrote, then he's going to take most of the points off (even if you're right but just write it in a different way).  For example, although I knew how to answer most of the problem, because I didn't write the two words he was looking for, he took 8 POINTS (out of 10) for not writing those words.  His grading makes no sense at all, and that is what pisses me off the most.
There are so many bad things I can say about him as a professor, but those are the two main problems.  Don't be shocked when you take this class, and you end up with a worse grade than you expect.   He is simply THAT arbitrary when it comes to this class.
Workload:
About 4 biweekly HW problem sets, and 2 exams (open notes, open book).  It wasn't supposed to be like this, but because he missed two weeks of classes, he didn't have time to give us more work.  Maybe in the future (if he is still teaching this course), there'll be more work (i.e. group presentation) to it.  Don't be fooled by the format of the exam; it's an open book/notes exam, but the questions can be vague and unclear that even open book/notes won't help.

While he is a generally nice guy, Glendinning really doesn't know his stuff.  Anything that is not directly regurgitated from the textbook (as are 90% of his lectures, which are all powerpoint based) could be blatantly wrong.  I caught rather blaring mistakes a couple of times and who knows how many he really made in class.  Occasionally he caught himself and corrected mistakes, or at least stood at the board and tried to figure things out for 10 minutes (wasting everyone's time), but often they went unmentioned/unnoticed.  While easily accessible outside of class, it's often clear that he either doesn't understand or doesn't know the answer to questions and talks in circles with his answers.  It's a shame there isn't a better professor to teach this class, because the subject material really is fascinating.

I took this class to fulfill my general ed literature requirement, so I am speaking as a non-English major.  In the beginning of the semester I was very frustrated with the class, most of the time the lectures had very little to do with the readings.  The lecturers were mostly the history of the time period of the readings.  But once I came to terms with that I actually found myself enjoying the class.  What I liked best about this class was that I could put it on the back burner while I did the work from my harder classes.  I basically only did the readings when it came time for the midterm/final and papers.   The material in the lectures was really never tested.  I would recommend this class to people who want an easy English class.

A course of memorization.  Unfortunately, it is not a course for the uninitiated in biology.  If you know very little about environmental biology and are looking for some inspiration, this course is not for you.  The prof says you need only listen to him and use the book as background, but the opposite is true.  Study the book and then maybe you'll understand him and get some interesting perspective from the prof.  A good survival strategy for those who have to take the class is to get a good biology text in advance and start memorizing the amino acids, DNA and basic genetics, photosynthesis, respiration, and read up on basic evolution and population science.  Then you should do well.  The prof likes written tests, so good advice would be to practise writing out a few definitions of basic concepts of the above, but beware, the multiple choice, when used, can ask for very detailed information about these processes.  He also asks for drawings of the important molecules.  The prof's lectures can be hard to follow and some people taped the class, but following the book first and then prof second probably saves time and works just as well.  A lot of the grade, 20%, is decided by him as a ""participation"" grade.  Students regularly corrected the prof as he sped through his molecules or genetics concepts on the blackboard, so that must contribute to the participation grade.  Good luck.

Eric Simring is exceptional.  
Eric wants to give an A+ grade to everyone of his students; however, you must work for it.  This is where his outstanding teaching skills enter.  He is kind, patient and takes the time to pay attention and challenge his students.  More importantly, Eric is ALWAYS willing to help and assist.   You can talk to him at any given time and have an amalgamation of the minds.  Eric is intelligent and a total badass, in my opinion. I loved his class!  His lectures are pleasurable and arduous, simultaneously.  The homeworks and exams are extremely long and challenging.  However, he factors the homework effort and assigns plenty of extra credit work into your final grade, which is an advantage.  I would highly recommend the class to all who are interested in pursuing the wonderful world of mathematics. It is very difficult to receive a grade lower than a B-.  Eric is the ideal math mentor.

This class is my first Dabashi experience - and I have to say that despite the excellent screening list, I am sorely dissapointed.  While I have no problem admitting that he may indeed have a great knowledge of issues pertaining to colonialism (I hear that class is good)- when it comes to film, this professor is sorely lacking.  He throws about the term ""auteur"" with regard to the directors/films we are discussing - but if you begin a sentence with ""the director's intention could be..."" he shoots you down most contemptuously.  His goal in the course is to create a ""collective mind"" and has stated that even if your paper is of publishable material, if there is no evidence of the collective mind, ""you will not get a good grade.""  Does this mean he is against individual thought?  I assume what he requires is to see his own misreadings and misinformed ideas on film regurgitated back to him in any paper we happen to produce - in order to get a ""good grade.""  His overarching argument is that society is codified and that film is not.  Has he never heard of the term ""cinematic codes?""  If cinema was not codefied, how would we be able to ""read"" films?  He makes sweeping statements such as, ""the sign of a true master director is when you don't notice the camera...""  Kubrick and Godard are turning in their graves right now.  He patronizes the huge number of college students in this class, through comments like ""Foreign films have long shots and subtitles, and you will think them boring - there is no Hollywood/Swartzenneger action in them..""  He makes his mind up about what is the be screened weekly - on a whim almost, on his way to class - even then...it may be a few days after class that we find out what next week's screening or reading is!  If you know absolutely nothing about film, you will still be in the dark after taking this class - other than the fact that you will see some great films that you might not have exposure to otherwise.  (but again - this class will try and force you to ""read"" these films in the ""Dabashi way"" - as if you interpret them in an alternate way - he won't want to hear about it!)   If you have only a mild interest in film, you may do ok - but you HAVE to have some sort of prior knowledge to be able to realize that most of his film-related comments are misinformed.  My heart goes out to the TAs who, due to the class size, are forced to have to deal with all the complaints about the disorganization - which really has nothing to do with them.

Amy Johnson knows her stuff about the books in the Lit Hum curriculum. She doesnÂ’t know too much, however, about how to convey her knowledge.  The class is unstructured Â– the period typically consisted of 2 hours of her reading a small passage out loud, summarizing the passage, and then lecturing for a few minutes on that passage.  This would be alright if she sparked interesting class discussions, but the class was generally asleep within 20 minutes and discussions did not generally go anywhere.  She is a lenient grader, both on the papers, and on the midterm and final.

Professor Ramamoorthi's lectures were generally fairly dry and could often be hard to follow. His accent isn't really an issue, but he has a way of failing to frame the question that's motivating what he's talking about; you get no sense of what he's building towards. He also doesn't speak very confidently; it's hard to tell whether he's entertaining a possibility for class discussion or actually saying that this is an accepted practice.
The lectures tailed off in quality by the end of the course (as did attendance, precipitously); some of the lectures got into mathematical details well beyond the requirements of the course and well beyond what most people in the class could readily understand.
As far as slides go: the slides were a fair basis for looking things up on the internet later, but no better.
The course was well organized insofar as the assignments go; the course fell down in other respects. The assigned readings in the main textbook (Computer Graphics by Peter Shirley) often had only a tentative relationship to our lectures, and their pedagogical approach was very, very different; it's a good book, but was useless for the class. Other assigned readings included big swaths from the OpenGL red book -- hundreds of pages in all. Fortunately, I think most of us were smart enough to know that one doesn't learn a programming API that way. Another example: the materials and lectures we were given on curves weren't really sufficient to understand the second assignment; my partner and I had to use online course notes from another university. (Reading up on curves in one of the optional texts would have done the trick too.)
The overall impression that I got, really, was that Professor Ramamoorthi viewed teaching the class as a chore, offloaded much of the work in running the class to our TA (actually writing up the assignment specifications, etc.), and didn't do a number of small things that would have improved the class greatly.
Workload:
The workload in the first half of the term was quite manageable -- the first two assignments took some thinking, but didn't require lots of code. The next two assignments were a lot more coding intensive. Coding-intensive is pretty typical for graphics courses, though, from what I understand. The assignments were all good learning experiences -- I feel they were the best part of the course.
We were asked to work in groups of two on all the assignments, though some people worked on their own by the end because of people dropping the course, etc. Coordinating with a partner could be a bit of a hassle, but certainly wasn't as difficult as it is with larger groups.

Professor Dabashi is a brilliant man with little commitment for his students. Part of what makes him a fantastic lecturer is the depth to which he is entrenched in his own thought. This is also what makes him an ineffective teacher. All he can do, in his own words, is to take his students to the kitchen of his mind and to show them what's cooking. (The man's speech is full of incredible and often extended visual metaphors.) He is either incapable of or too lazy to listen to people who are either not on the same page as he is or don't particularly like the page that he is on.  His dismissals and his disinterestedness result in minimal participation by his students, even if the class is a senior or graduate seminar. Many very competent students I have spoken with came out of his classes feeling inadequate. This is unfair.
[I disagree with the previous student's reading of the screening room incident in that I think the first student's remarks were misinterpreted. The second student's mistake was in her hasty reading of his remark, not in her reaction to the terrible thing she thought he had said. I agree that Dabashi overreacted massively by lashing out at her the way he did, silencing her for the rest of the semester. Foul.]

 Â“These works are over two-thousand years old.  If you think youÂ’re going to come up with anything original, youÂ’re mistaken.Â”  With this phrase, Amy Johnson set the tone of the class for me.  Indeed, much of class was spent reviewing the plot rather than doing analysis.  
Ms. Johnson required us to write two questions for each class period.  These were collected and counted towards our class participation grade because Â“many people donÂ’t talk in class.Â”  It was unclear what exactly she wanted with these (and much of each class consisted of her berating us for bad questions:  Â“donÂ’t ask me why this happens Â– itÂ’s just the way the book goesÂ”) 
Amy Johnson is a good lit-hum teacher whose class had one crucial problem:  it had no structure whatsoever.  Sometimes she would read our questions out loud and respond to them.  Other times, she would review the plot.  One class, she assigned a part of the work to each person and had us analyze it.  Unfortunately, class wasnÂ’t very stimulating.  As hard as she tried, she couldnÂ’t make class interesting (and she seemed to give up at some point).  She rarely prompted the class for input and she never wrote anything on the chalkboard.  More often, she would passively sit and talk (in a slow drawn-out sort of voice with lots of long pauses) about the work.  Frankly, it was boring, and people would sometimes fall asleep.  If you could stay awake and pay attention (as I was eventually able to do), youÂ’d realize that she actually had some very insightful things to say about the works and some insightful connections to current events.
Bottom line:  ItÂ’s not hard to do well in her class (just do the questions, and write solid essays).  If you want to survive and enjoy class time, however, have some coffee and try hard to pay attention.

For each class we had to write two questions based on the reading.  We also had two 5-7 page essays -- the first was close-analysis of a scene.  For the second, we could do another close-analysis, or we could connect a work we studied to something else (a newspaper article, a poem, a book, a movie etc.).  SheÂ’s a fairly easy grader on the essays, and will read over rough drafts before the due date.  Also, she took feedback when setting due-dates.  She did not assign any extra books (in fact, we didnÂ’t even read part of the bible)

Professor Gibber is probably the best professor I've had at Columbia so far.  Does she go off on tangents? Yes, but they are really interesting and usually apply the material she's going over (so it helps to demonstrate her point).  She is disorganized sometimes, but it doesn't detract from the class at all because she knows what she is talking about otherwise...I guess it could detract from the class if you're pretentious or one of those students the rest of us find annoying, but for the rest of us they provide nice breaks in writing.  Also, the only reason she is disorganized is because everyone and their mother asks her for a recommendation, in addition to all the stuff she does for the bio department.  I would definitely consider her inspiring and her class is not that bad (as in hard) at all and I would consider myself a huge slacker (I crammed for every test).  She always answers questions and is willing to discuss anything with anybody thoroughly.  Her lectures are so easy to follow and she makes the material seem really easy and almost intuitive.  This class is great.
Workload:
Readings are unnecessary but help (I did the readings in the beginning and then stopped and it made no difference in my grade).  The mini-exam system is definitely less stressful than fewer but longer midterms, but you definitely need to write down every detail.  Another word of advice: go to every class, because the readings don't even begin to cover what she goes over in class.  Besides studying there was almost no out of class work, besides the writing assignments which are really easy.

It is not every semester you come across a professor who infuses their scholarship and teaching with such vigor and excitement. 
   As an aside, Professor B has asked that the following be advertised on CULPA (although she is not a user): When it comes to sleeping in class or having your cell phone ring, she can be (in her words) ""A real bitch on wheels.""

Avoid Professor Woike at all costs.  Do not be fooled by the ""fun"" first lecture or two.  Once she ropes you in, she turns a complete 180 and proceeds to deliver a semester's worth of boring, unorganized ""lectures"".  She is extremely affected, and while she clearly knows her stuff she is incapable of presenting it coherantly.  Also:  in order to succeed in this class, you must be willing to photocopy your own copies of thick piles of esoteric journal articles (not online), which may or may not be on reserve at the barnard library (note:super-annoying hours.  Biggest copico card balance i've ever encountered.  once a professor assigns that many pages of reading, a COURSEPACK is required.
a note on her exams: they include minute details that test your ability to physically be in your seat, and retain mindless information that does not pertain to the subject matter.  for example (i'm paraphrasing, but the essence remains): according to the video we saw in class, erikson's  (A) wife's name is mary  (B) lived in cleaveland  (C) had a border collie growing up  (D) all of the above.    she also asked the author of our textbook.

The severity of the problem with Introductory Biology at Columbia has not been truly brought to light by these other reviews.  Allow me to raise a few points:
1) Why does Dr. Mowshowitz (with a little Chasin and Gibber sprinkled in) have a monopoly on the Intro Bio racket? Have any of you stopped to think that in Physics, G Chem and Orgo, Columbia offers you a choice of at least 3 different professors per semster.  So why is she the only choice one of the most prestigious institutions of our country offers for such an important subject? 
2) What right does Dr. Mowshowitz have to filter a class through her lenses the way she does?  Let me explain: in G Chem, Physics and Orgo, the main source of material is a textbook.  But in Dr. Mowshowitz's class, the information comes mainly from her on-line notes and the problems (which mirror her exams) are based on problems she wrote or co-wrote. Not trusting the industry standard Campbell (or Becker and Purves for that matter) for problems she forces students to wrestle with her style.  If that style does not fit yours, well you're out of luck, there are no alternatives or other professors offered. 
3) Down to the nitty gritty: Her problem sets and more importantly exams are comprised of a set of questions with subsections which are often interconnected.  For example there is #1 1-a, 1b, 1c.....and #2 2a, 2b, 2c.  Now, not only is all of problem #1 (i.e. 1a, 1b etc) based on one question, but often problems #1 and #2 are connected. The point being: there is a domino effect.  If you get one part wrong this leads you to get another part wrong and often even other entire problems.  I would prefer questions that are wholly independent of each other so there is no double jeopardy. Again, I am asking that she model her exams like G Chem, Physics and Orgo.
Amen,

IÂ’ve seen a lot of raves and a lot of rants so I just want to set some things straight.  Overall I think Professor Fine is a great professor.  Although, I agree with some of the negative comments posted.  Yes, he does talk about stuff that is not on the exam (e.g. history of 309 Havemeyer) but it makes the class interesting.  Yes, he is political to some degree.  But all of his Â“off topicÂ” stuff throughout the semester doesnÂ’t even add up to half a lecture.  He covers the material very well.  His powerpoints are a little bit disorganized, but he tries to give them out before lecture so you can take notes on them Â– unlike many other Profs.  When he works out problems, he works them out on the blackboard Â– which I think is much better than trying to follow equations through powerpoint slides.
He is very approachable during office hours and holds his own review sessions before the exam.  Go to those review sessions - he basically goes over everything you need to know.  Sometimes, he even gives away exam questions!   If you show up to lecture, you will be rewarded.  There are several questions on each exam that you will know just by being in lecture or seeing the demos.
The extra problem sets that he posts are ball busters, but he will help you solve them -  if you ask.  The TA's will also help you solve them - if you ask.  Yes, they are hard, but they really test your understanding of the material.  The exam questions are nowhere near as hard.
The class was fun and informative.  Professor Fine is definitely not condescending and aloof.  He responds to the mid-term survey that you fill out, he goes over it in class and addresses the suggestions and comments that students make.  He wants to get to know his students but you need to take the initiative too Â– he has over 300 students between the 2 sections.  He invited students to sign up to have dinner with him at faculty house.  I believe ~ 30 students signed up and he took them to dinner in groups of  10.  How many ""aloof and unapproachable"" Profs at Columbia do that?

Lorenzo Polvani was a great teacher. He made a subject that students probably usually hate painless. I hated Ordinary Differential Equations (taught by Krichever) and was dreading taking PDE, but it turned out to be one of the better classes I've had. This is probably the only painfree PDE experience at Columbia: everyone hates the pure math one and I think Bal, APMA 3102 is worse than Lorenzo. Polvani's lectures broke down lengthy problems into very straight forward techniques. He's not a native English speaker, but it's good enough that I shouldn't have even mentioned it. 
This class is identical to APMA 3102: Applied Mathematics II, but has a graduate course number for first year grad students (mostly Biomedical Engineers and some Applied Phyics/Math). The midterm had its share of tricky questions but was not too hard. I thought the class was really straight forward until the last 3 weeks (the worst time for a class to get hard) when we started doing non-homogeneous problems and Green functions. Of course they were the focus of the final and I thought it was impossible. It's one of those courses where the final includes what's on the midterm indirectly, but all of the questions are from the last half of the semester, so I felt totally incompetent even though I was really comfortable with at least 75% of the material.

Those who are intelligent but uneducated in art will probably find that she goes a little too slowly or is a little to easy on the student but that the class is nonetheless a solid introduction.

I enjoyed this class and found Marie Regan to be a competent instructor. The syllabus reflected the broad nature of its subject and included many classics that deserve to be watched and re-watched. Also, Prof. Regan made an attempt to cover current and international examples of cinema and include them in an ultimately well-streamlined course. Class time was well-paced and organized, and I always felt like I was learning something important. My only complaint was with Regan's attempts to lead class discussions: she seemed well-intentioned, but often came across as opinionated, which was very frustrating to students who felt like she was not receptive enough to their ideas if they were not exactly what she was thinking.

Professor Mendelson is to modern British literature as LaToya Jackson is to modern British literature.  I can honestly say that MendyÂ’s class was one of the absolute worst I have ever taken at Columbia.  As many of the other reviewers have said, his painful early morning lectures involve little more than loosely paraphrasing the plots of the novels or poetry, sharing a few of the same stupid anecdotes again and again (e.g. his young son attending an awkward junior high dance, or his infamous Â“ScarsdaleÂ” story), pointing out a few passages that he again paraphrases and then drops completely, and picking one or two issues in the literature and beating them into the ground.  Is Tess a free individual, or mererly the subject of the whims of the cosmos?  Gee, I donÂ’t know... but how about we spend three weeks on it!  And of course, no lecture would be complete without Mendelson stopping literally mid-sentence to single out (in front of a room of over one hundred) any student who may be slouching in his chair, tapping her pen, cracking his knuckles, or even laughing a bit too loudly.

I enjoyed this class because the material was interesting, but it took me half the semester to figure out how to study for the exams and read the papers. As a professor, Jian assumes that you know more than you probably do, in particular basic circuit physics and experimental procedures. He does, however, speak rather slowly (because english is his second language) and writes on the board which both allow you to take good notes in class. While he does require us to memorize endless details, they all come straight from the class notes or papers. The exams are going to focus not on how something works, but instead on how it would work if you did X to it, and how this increases our understanding of the system as a whole. Neurobio is a field still in progress so the focus of the class is very experiment oriented.  You need to know why we believe so and so. The first test is almost all physics and most of the class drops it. After that it gets better. If you decide to take this class, I recommend the following for tests:
1. Write down everything he says in class including anything he says you do not need to know and memorize ALL of it. (do not focus on the book)
2. Study in groups, because you will inevitably miss something.
3. Make flash cards for numbers, statistics and chemicals
4. Understand the ""story"" of each process (biochemical pathway, different parts involved) using the book to fill in the gaps.
5. Make a list of experimental procedures described in class and in the papers and how each works. Toxins, Markers, and there effects on larger processes. He will ask you to ""design"" experiments on exams.
6. If he describes a specific experiment, know it well.
For reading papers: 
1. There are helpful resources in the Bio library on the 6th floor of Fairchild. 
2. Focus on understanding the diagrams, these are what usually appear on exams, in particular the techniques used to produce the image and what we learn from it.
3. If you have the time, especially for the final, go through the paper with a set of flashcards. For each step in the researchers thought process make a question and write down the answer. You will need to know how they reasoned the design of the experiment and their conclusions.
4. For the really detailed papers, use your best judgement on what is important. For example, we did a paper on the crystalized structure of rhodopsin. While we did not need to know every amino acid, we did need to know the ones that caused kinks in the chain, and what sequences allow the effects described in class.  Also, we did a paper on the structure of a potassium channel, the point of the paper was how ion selection was achieved, and a key part to this involved the dimensions of the channel. These precise dimensions for the channel in angstroms were on our exam. Figure out what the paper is getting at and memorize those statistics.

Just going to echo the other reviews and say that this guy is great. I had no economics experience whatsoever before taking Principles in the fall, and he made it very easy to follow. Lectures are very engaging: this was probably the only class I never fell asleep in, despite it being at 9 AM. Gulati has a great sense of humor (although I do remember things like the other review described happening, right down to the ""Achoo!"") and the class almost never drags until the end with some of the macro stuff. As for Global Econ, it's the first time they're offering the class, and I only took it because of him. So far it seems to be pretty good, run very much like the Principles class except no discussions. (Which, BTW, were utterly useless in Principles.) He can take any subject and relate it to econ. He also encourages class discussion, but doesn't really require it. Overall, he's probably the only professor I've had here that I'd recommend to anyone else. And in case anyone thinks this is a review from an econ major, it's not. I'm a pathetically apathetic engineer :)

Nice guy for sure, definitely knows his stuff, but the combination of the awful acoustics of the room and his inability to project his voice, as well as the completely uninteresting material of the first part of the class make it difficult to stay awake, much less pay attention in lectures. It's not really essential to go to lectures anyway, except right before the tests, when he gives out a review sheet.
As for discussion sections, both terms he started the first class by saying how he was going to set one up, looking around the room, and commenting, ""Wow, we have more people here than expected..."" So the only discussion is on courseworks. It's required but not graded. There's a midterm, final, and 8-10 page paper (10-15 I think for Modern). He does try to make some of the classes interesting with films and guests, and the modern section of intro is much more pleasant, though still a little dry.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this class. I took it solely to fill the pre-1800s requirement and found it not only un-painful but enjoyable. While I probably would have been bored by the material if I read it on my own, professor Crane inspired me to look for the threads of our own culture within the values expressed in the literature of the past, thus making the material interesting.  She is an animated lecturer who clearly loves the material she is discussing. She both gives well-planned lectures and allows moments for feedback from the students. The work is distributed throughout the semester so you always have a pretty good idea of where you stand. She also does her best to allow creativity in class and written assignments, ranging from performing plays, to writing poetry. Be wary, however, of doing assignments in writing styles (such as iambic pentameter) that you have not used before; you will be graded on form as well as content.

Benjamin Martin is the best professor I've had at Columbia and he's a grad student. He is incredibly engaging, refuses to lecture, guides the class through the key points every text while never spelling them out, and he kindly sends out question lists before every class session to guide the reading. He pushed every one of us to improve immensely in our writing and clarity of argument. He doesn't allow for shooting off at the mouth unless you cite the text, which encourages you to read closely and carefully while taking notes. This class has changed my life and I wouldn't trade anything for it.

Avg. CC workload, perhaps on the heavier side in terms of books assigned, but he doesn't give more reading than is possible and frequently edits down the readings by page number, preferring to lighten the load in the interest of closer reading.

Milarsky is one of the best professors I have ever had. He is a passionate, lively and energetic person who communicates the subject matter really well. Music Hum. is a broad course that covers history of music chronologically from the middle-ages to nowadays. It might be hard to enjoy if the professor is not good. As an Econ major I feared this class was going to be a waste of time, but instead I discovered a passion for classic music. If I wasn't a senior I would have majored in music as well. Being around passionate people is what makes Columbia so special and professors Milarsky is one of them; his comments are original and interesting and he managed to get our brainpower even at 9AM. If you hang out in the back of the class he wonÂ’t ask you anything but youÂ’ll get into it anyway. He is also easy-going and open-minded and interacts a lot with the students while accepting every opinion.
We also had a great TA who plays violin and we had the school's Chorus sing for us. We saw one opera (Carmen) and the professor invited us to a really modern percussion concert he conducted. It was a really entertaining class on top of being culturally fulfilling and intellectually stimulating. I highly recommend Milarsky if he teaches Music Hum. again.

Dave rocks. Although he sometimes pushes his own opinions in class or tries to force the class discussion towards his way of thinking, this happens less often than in any other english class I've ever taken. Every monday he asks the class what adventures we had over the weekend (and appreciates stories about wings and beer as well as stories about museums). What more could you ask for? Our class discussions have challenged a lot of the opinions and assumptions I came to this class with and gave me a broader perspective (sickeningly college-brochure-like, isn't it?). The only downside: he fails to make everyone participate, so there are always a few kids silent (falling asleep) in the corner. Don't be those kids!

MÃ©lanie has really interesting philosophical ideas, and she's cute and Parisian. The fact that she's a native speaker doesn't, unfortunately, make her a good teacher.

Prof. Magnuson is a really nice guy, seemingly very organized, plus he's got clear powerpoint presentations that he puts up on the web; however, he is the prototypical bumbling professor who can't keep the material straight and ends up confusing the class more with all his back and forth about what is or isn't  the case. He even confuses himself. It is painful to watch because you know he feels very badly for not knowing what he is talking about - or maybe more accurately - he doesn't have a clue about how to explain himself clearly and efficiently (isn't parsimony the hallmark of psychological research?!!) It's also painful because you know he puts a lot into planning this class and writes up super detailed (read: long winded) directions for each lab exercise. However, the TA wrote up his own version of the directions (for two different assignments!!) because his were just not clear. This is a 1000 level class - so why am I so confused??!!

In my opinion, this woman does not come from an education background.  When she's speaking, she preaches her own ideas, and if she's not doing that, all she likes to talk about are people's personal opinions and personal experiences -- crap no one wants to hear because, really do we care about how this movie reminds you of your sister or an experience you had in summer camp? NO. 
She doesn't know how to teach, bottom line. She's very rigid about what you write about in these mini-essays you write every few weeks. If it's not exactly what she wants she'll reject it. Clearly, she's not too interested in what the way her students' minds work because if she was, then she would understand that not everyone analyzes films and articles on her agenda. She LOVES her agenda and thinks of nothing else. There's hardly enough discussion on important topics. When it comes to important topics and interesting discussions, she likes to have everyone shut up and talk about her own analysis.

We did not learn a thing about music, and the only people in the class who had a clue what was going on were people who had extensive muscial backgrounds (prob someone like the person who wrote the above review).
Furthermore, his tests were utter nightmares--for the midterm he literaly copied paragraphs out of the textbook, took out words, and asked us to fill in the blanks.  The finals was a series of questions on completely unimportant subjects that were minimaly covered in class or in the textbook.
The papers were also quite difficult.  The first paper required us to anaylze an opera, of the teachers choosing and the second paper required us to have a far deeper understanding of music and the technicalities of music than the class afforded us.

Pretty much anyone can teach a molecular biology class.  Just look at the textbook, make some PPslides, and regurgitate.

Jack McGourty led an overhaul of the Gateway Lab curriculm. What was once a relatively painless, quick introduction to computer design has grown into Jack's little pet monstrosity. Rumor has it that Jack was selected for this task because the other deans of the engineering school realized that Jack did NOTHING. So, he became the head of the Gateway course and shifted the emphasis to ""team-building"" and other vague notions. Jack's lectures might be more interesting than Jose's (who lectures about CAD), but Jose is trying to teach a skill, not listen to the sound of his own voice. In addition to his worthless lectures, Jack assigns a lot of pointless homework exercises, mostly featuring PowerPoint. As each semester passes and the feedback is constantly terrible, Jack tries to change the course (and don't worry, he'll pat himself on the back more than once for being responsive to students), but instead of dropping the pointless things that people complain about (e.g. anything that Jack has a hand in), he expands them to attempt to justify their existence. Jack has changed the course from a one day a week 3-point lab course to a course with an whole Jack lecture a week AND a lab. Don't worry though, Jack will praise himself for making the class worth 4 points to reflect these changes- people want LESS not MORE, Jack(ass).

As a teacher, Remez isn't bad; for the most part, he kept my attention, and I did learn a lot from his class. As a person... well, that's a different story. He's the most rigid person I ever met -- everything he does is more or less set in stone, and he doesn't deal well with unexpected outside interruptions (even unintentional ones). He's probably got some form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. While he finds it okay during his lectures to go off on tangents (and I mean TANGENTS -- he'll literally take time out to go around the room and ask each member of the class what they had for breakfast that morning), but he has trouble with students raising their hands and asking questions related to the material during the middle of his lecture. (He'll politely tell you to wait until he's finished talking.) Not to mention he has little to no concern for his students. He's always in a hurry to leave class following a lecture and won't stick around to talk to students afterwards, even for a minute. And even though he urges students to come to his office hours, he won't stay a minute past the allotted time.

Though I must admit, 17th and 18th century literature is not quite my choice area of study (frankly, I find it rather dull), just listening to him lecture about it made me want to enjoy what I'd read, or maybe wish I could've enjoyed reading it more (since usually about 90% of the reading went over my head). Professor Basker really succeeded in exposing why these works are so great and why they should be and have continued to be read -- and I guess I can't ask for much more than that from a compulsory major requirement I really wasn't that keen on taking to begin with.

Not your typical English class -- NO PAPERS. (He reasons they're just a distraction and take away from the time you could be spending reading.) Two short midterms -- all ID's. A final, all essays (which seems more daunting than it is, only because you haven't written anything for him all semester). And weekly (very short) homework assignments (""write a parody of such and such poem"" or ""find five examples of [certain literary device] in this work"") to go along with some 200-400 pages of (dense difficult) reading per week -- that sometimes seems so unwieldy I get the sense he doesn't generally expect most of the class to finish all the way through.

You will walk out of this class saying ""huh?!!""   I have no idea why people rave about Prof. Ko.  Hers was the probably the worst class I've ever taken.  She NEVER looks at her students, therefore class discussion never ensues and questions are not encouraged.  She delivers her lectures in an oddly, measured cadence, which only serves to further muddy whatever point she's trying to get across.  Profound?  Please!  Personally, I think there are much better ways of conveying impressive knowledge and insight other than speaking in riddles.  But here's a tip:  if you want to take this class, make sure you spit back some meaningless, seemingly profound mumbo-jumbo back at her.  You'll probably get an A.

I agree with the second reviewer. Prof Chatterjee provided deep an insightful comments on the various texts we read, raised  issues that weren't immediately obvious from a first reading of the texts, and argued on both sides of the issues raised in class, leaving us to give our own opinions in papers and such: basically, he did all the things a good professor should do. The class was arranged by topics, something that was most definately emphasized on the syllabus. I do have previous knowledge of South Asia, and I found that this class, far from being  elementary or boring, gave a depth of inquiry into the four topics discussed not found in other South Asian history classes which have so much ground to cover. If anything, previous knowledge of South Asian history was helpful. The four topics were ""Nationalism and Modern Statehood"", ""Modernity and Religious Reform"", ""Modernity and Women"" and ""Modernity and Caste"". (Lots of discussion about modernity) Basically the course was about the production of opposing categories like modernity and tradition in a colonial context, and how these categories were worked through different areas like gender, religion, caste and the state. I really recommed this class to anyone actually interested in South Asian history rather than just getting rid of their core requirement.

The class is great, she is not.  While she teaches the material in a straightforward and and interesting manner, she is not one to cultivate an air of free-thinking in the classroom.  She assigns bi-weekly exercises, in which she asks really detailed essay questions but requires a 500 word limit.  When you turn in the exercise which obviously could not include everything, she grades you down for not including everything.  It's like she wants you to fit 2,000 words worth of content and analysis into 500 words.  Everyone in the class had a problem with this.  Also, when she asks questions in class or on the exams, she asks questions that could result in various interpretations, but you get graded down if you don't give her interpretation.  And, what's worse, when you ask her questions or try to get a feel of what her viewpoint or interpretation is, she's very elusive.  You just have to wing it and guess and hope that when she returns the paper you've guessed right.  Not a great class because of this.  Unless you want to be her clone in terms of thinking, and you have an innate ability to read her mind, don't take her class.

Eugene is an excellent instructor. He has vigour and passion in what he does. He knows the readings well, but is not strict about THE interpretation. That is to say he ll always look into new ideas and perspectives, and this he does without going off topic or no longer making sense.
His approach to writing and learning about writing is great. through the readings he has taught us to close read and analyze liek no one else.
Incredibly smart, and nice in a slightly goof way, this instructor also can understand students, their demands and concerns when homework is due. He makes the class thus enjoyable, and I actually like pumping out papers for him.

I agree with the previous reviewers insofar as the fact that Sarris isn't your typical professor. . . Thank GOD.  He's self-effacing, but he also eschews feigned modesty.  I don't know why people have qualms about Sarris' style.  Chances are, they were influenced by his mode of thought before they even set foot into room 511.  Don't expect Sarris to serve up his instruction like well-prepared feasts.  You may have to forage through his digressive anecdotes for the golden nuggets of wisdom.  The truth is, he's not ""dotty"" in the slightest.  No matter how much his tales meander, they always wind up delivering a surprisingly cogent point-- that is, if you bear with him and listen.  And, if you read any of his reviews in the Observer, you already know that this style of speaking probably derives from his much-loved bel lettre writing style.  If you're expecting to be instructed, you'd do better to learn from Sarris as an example.
Prof. Sarris always tries to get a feel for what the young people today are like-- he gives class a somewhat homey feel, which I find most welcome.  At the same time, he's not afraid to discuss the grittier aspects of film.  In fact, Sarris brings up sensuality and sex in nearly every class-- only he doesn't coat the topics in slippery theoretics.
His writing film criticism class is wicked good.  It's very small, and he tells you what he thinks of your review right then and there.  Unlike some film profs here, he's very direct in his suggestions, as well as his praises.

He fills the class with many anecdotes, and it seems like he actually cares about teaching us.  He's also very accessable outside of class.  Any flaws exist with the class, not him as a professor.  Legacy is a GREAT class to take for first-year english - it has the best syllabus by FAR!  Paradise Lost, Candide, Frankenstein, Heart of Darkness, To the Lighthouse, Their Eyes Were Watching God, & many shorter works such as Freud or the Communist Manifesto.  EXCELLENT readings everyone should read at some point anyway.  I the problem with the class is that there is SO MUCH material, I don't feel like we spend nearly enough time on any of it.

We are lucky to have Amy here in our theatre department.  Puppetry is a theatre art form not normally taught in college departments, but at Barnard-Columbia was have the opportunity to learn from one of the leaders in the field.  It is a very humbling art form and it further informs all of your work as a performer.  Amy teaches about finding the balance between restraint and action, and expressing an idea as simply and directly as possible.  She is very good at helping students find their individual strong points and working from there, but this is provided the student-performer is willing to listen to what she has to say.  
Amy is indeed a character and has a very particular, if unconventional style teaching.  She's not your average Ivy League professor, but the training and teachings she imparts are on a very high level.  She has high expectations of her students, and this pushes them to produce quality work that they may nit have thought to produce otherwise.
She has traveled around the world, having visited the Middle East, India, China.  From tiny villages to larger cities.  She has video taped examples of traditional theatre from these non-Western cultures, and she has brought the ideas of these other theatre forms to influence our work here at Columbia-Barnard.
Amy's realm is the realm of doing.  The best way to learn from her is to learn by actual practice.  The value of her teaching is found in the practical work.  At a school where so much of we are taught is theoretical, it is refreshing to have a professor who is so well-grounded in the practical.
She uses a style of blind justice and does not play favorites.  This is helpful preparation for a career in the real theatre world.

This course is an excellent trial-by-fire for anyone considering entering the design field professionally.  Erik brings to the classroom his own knowledge and experience  from work in the professional world, and he shares this experience with his students both directly and indirectly -- he will not only tell you about what it's like to work in the field, but he will treat big student presentations as if they were an actual pitch session.  And this is great!  You really get a sense of what sort of demands are made in the outside theatre world.
Furthermore, Erik pushes his students to think critically about the design process while exploring various design options.  He does not AT ALL put a dampener on creative and fantastical design ideas, though he will remind you to keep in mind some practical considerations (budget, discussing the vision with the rest of the design team, spitching the idea to a director).

Professor Bulliet taught in a 400-person lecture room, and his ego was still too big for the room. He did not prepare a general plan for the semester, let alone a syllabus, and would often come to class not having even thought about what he was going to lecture on that day. While these lectures sometimes contained semi-relevant anecdotes, they often were as obscure as tales of his great aunt Magda from the midwest, or the use of his writings in the animal porn industry (no joke). To me, his lack of preparedness showed a great lack of respect for the students and made my academic life in the class rather frustrating. Since CU has no graduate students in Middle Eastern history, the TAs often know just a tad more than the students, which is rather frustrating during pre-exam review sessions. Despite the class title, most of the class covered basic early Islamic history, and he tried to cram all of Americas relation to the Muslim world into the last few weeks of class. The only thing I can say to his credit is that he did not hit you over the head repeatedly with his own political views about the Middle East, which is a pitfall many lecturers in this topic tend to fall into. Overall, its just not worth your time: there are better classes on the modern Middle East from far better professors in this University.

Prof. Kaji would always show up late to class with a bag of White Castle hamburgers, and the worst part was that he'd eat them all at once, rolling them together until they formed a large, doughy beef cluster, and he wouldn't give any to the class. Every once in awhile, our TA would open his mouth expectantly, but Prof. Kaji never deigned to give up the slightest piece of his giant hamburger-ball. After eating, he would wipe his face onto his cummerbund -- he always wore eveningwear, as if to show off the elegance of the truly mentally obese -- and then slurp at an extra-large beverage in a white cylinder as big as my head. I found the whole thing kind of attractive, but the homework -- eating a side of beef every hour -- was a drag. For our midterm, we had a pancake-eating contest, which was fun.
Despite the constant overeating, the class is actually centered around a sort of intellectual obestiy, the kind that has developed since the days of Pynchon and progressed to the style of reporting of Wolf Blitzer.

This class was a great opportunity to learn basic Chinese Opera movement from a professional Chinese Opera performer, Qian Yi.  This is a wholly practical class that teaches graceful stylized movement that is, generally speaking, at the same time similar to both ballet and kung fu.  Elements of yoga and tai chi are also incorporated into the training and warm up.
In addition to the class' interesting cultural value, the movement training is very useful for performers in general.  It gives a sense of awareness of the body, expands your vocabulary of movement, and helps train physical discipline.  Plus there was work with ""weapons,"" which included short and long sticks.  Training here included learning to work the sticks in circular spinning patterns. 
I took this class in fall 2003.  There was no work with singing or other vocalizations at that time.  It was only movement based, which is fine considering there was a whole lot to learn in such a short time.
The teacher, Qian Yi, is friendly and exceptionally patient.  I applaud her for her willingness to share this Chinese Opera training with our class and for her patience with us as we worked to learn the new & unfamiliar Eastern-style movements.

Fellow students and I have commented amongst ourselves that we are very fortunate to have Amy as a professor here at Columbia-Barnard undergrad theatre.  Puppetry and mask performance are not commonly taught in college theatre programs, but I have found that they can be exceptionally helpful in one's work as a performer.
Through puppet & mask technique, Amy teaches about simplicity and clarity in movement, use of restraint, and a sort of humility that comes from putting all of your focus into animating an object (instead of focusing on yourself).
As another reviewer commented, Amy's teaching style is really grounded in the practical.  That is to say, the practical application of performance techniques.  Things can become confusing if you talk about ideas and techniques in theory.  However, by actually trying out your ideas and showing Amy what you have in mind, you will find a very productive learning experience.
Amy seems very concerned about her students' work, and she responds well to students' enthusiasm and positive energy.  She is incredibly objective and offers pin-point feedback for presented work; she does not at all play favorites when it comes to giving feedback and constructive criticism.  This, I find, is a really great thing, since it means there's no chance for slacking off.  She really teaches students to just keep trying and trying in order to find something that works, something that reads well to the audience, something coherent and clear.

She is new at Columbia (it's Harvard's loss for giving her up after 26 years) but extremely experienced -- practically at home at the front of a classroom.

Kushnir is the first of three profs for this class.  He covers the atmospheric section of the syllibus.  He is a little man with a little voice and has an accent.  All told, it's kinda adorable.  BUT - he WILL put you to sleep.  How many times can a man say ""adiabatic lapse rate"" in a sentance and expect his students not to be snoring?  Sometimes he confuses himself, and therefore the class, but manages to make most of it make sense as long as your brain is awake.  All of his presentations are available online and I recommend reading the notes posted online before the power points many times over.  That's the only way I made sense of it.  The labs are painful - literally - after two and a half hours of staring at colored charts on the computer your eyes will be burning.  The lad write ups are even more painful, sometimes taking more than 10 hours to complete.  It's hard and intimidating but the midterm is suprizingly simple.

Professor Peterson is by far one of the best professors MEALAC has to offer. Besides being fluent in five languages, and an accomplished singer, she is a wonderful, kind human being.

She respects and rewards hard work, enthusiasm, creativity, and true intellect. I felt like i could talk endlessly about any subject with her.

Professor Dabashi is by far the absolute worst professor i've had during my graduate career at Columbia, and that he manages to garner teaching accolades, attract groupies comprised of nubile undergraduates, and remains the chair of two departments despite sheer incompetence, arrogance, total lack of organization and general smarminess, I'm sure are signs that the four horsemen of the Apocolypse have just touched down, and will be galloping among us quite soon.
For all his dramatics and colorful metaphors, Dabashi is really himself what he enjoys calling his critics, ""a failed academic"".  Dabashi not only manages to avoid discussing intelligently or coherently the films he screens , he completely neglects to mention anything from any of the books he's assigned.  Instead he rambles incoherently about Hegel, Nietzsche and a host of other German philosophers who have nothing to do with this class.
 As a previous reviewer noted, Robert Stam's ""Subversive Pleasures"", was the only book worth buying, and frankly it was the only book from which i learned anything about film!!  Dabashi's assigns his own book (i wouldn't call it a book, actually- it's more like a large, badly written brochure) on Iranian cinema, entitled ""Close-Up"" ( the cover of which Orientalizes/exoticizes Muslim women by repeating the cliche of one in full burka, standing in a beam of light no less). If you are unfortunate enough to shell over $ for a copy and spend time reading it, you just confirm what you already knew before buying it: Dabashi doesn't really know much about Iranian cinema(or any cinema). He's just friends with alot of Iranians who happen to be world renown filmmakers and he enjoys cooing about them.  
I could put up with all the patronizing and indignity in the world from any professor as long as i learned SOMETHING from him or her! Dabashi, however, is incapable of either formulating or inspiring any original thought, though he's quite fluent at speaking out of his 'arse'. If you catch him doing this, he will bring the full force of his tongue bearing down upon your sorry head. He has no respect or patience for opinions contradicting his own, no matter how well and respectfully articulated, and he has no time for his students outside the classroom.
It would be quite apt for him to one day screen ""The Wizard of Oz"" as he shares so much in common with the title character: flashy, moody, and full of hot air. Do not waste your money or time taking this class or any class by him.

A great professor.  Sadly, i never went/go to class, but a few friends do.  The schedule itself is horrible (M/W/F) but he does his best to make it fun and interesting, and he does a damn good job at it.
As far as teaching, i show(ed) up mostly fridays to hand in the weekly homework, and from what i saw, he knows his stuff, knows how to teach it, and most importantly, knows when to slow down and repeat what he just said.
He's sooo accessible.  He will go out of his way just to help you with any problem you have (class-related or not), and has office hours seemingly constantly.
As far as workload goes, it's the usual engineering workload.  Weekly problem sets (they are hard, don't start them the night before), two midterms and a final.
The book will cost you an arm and a leg!  Soo expensive, not clear at all, but contains millions of problems.  If you want to learn anything, i suggest you go to class, or borrow another book from the library.
Overall, probably the best teacher in engineering who's course i've taken, not because he's the smartest, but because he actually wants to teach instead of just do research.  Teaching is a job to him, not just a nuisance.

I signed up for this expecting Schamus, but as it turned out, Jameel made the class more engaging, informative, and fun than I expected. Jameel is very well-versed in film theory, and does a terrific job of making even the driest of theorists (Kracauer) relevant to contemporary popular and avant garde film. He is extremely enthusiastic, and pushes his students with questions and analogies until the theory readings come alive for them. His lectures never failed to clear up ambiguities in the readings, although the films screened were not always as obviously relatable to the readings. If you take this class as a junior or senior, there will be a few films you've seen before, but movies like ""Potemkin"" and ""Rules of the Game"" deserve another look. Jameel is a great teacher, not at all like some of the prima donnas in the film department. Take this class.

Prof. Braverman is an effective instructor.

I completely agree with the previous reviewer-- This class was really torture.  Absolutely don't take it unless you have spent a large portion of your life studying Bible verses. In a six week course, you are expected to not only read the Bible, but be able to identify random verses for the midterm and final exam, which is completely impossible, not only because the Bible is so repetitive, but also because thousands of exhausting pages are covered in less than six weeks. There is not enough time in the day to thoughtfully read the amount of pages given for homework if you haven't studied it once before, and Besserman is not at all a compassionate grader. 
If this class were really an English class, the class could have been really cool. But in addition to Besserman's incessant preaching, I never understood how memorizing Bible versus had anything to do with English literature. Do we memorize Dickens passages  for a 19th century class? Totally outrageous. In fact, it should be picked up in the religion department, but if it were, I still wouldn't take it.

Professor Dabashi is hardly a brilliant thinker and rarely a good professor. Before enrolling in this course, i heard alot of positive hype surrounding Professor Dabashi. Most of it however seems to be associated with his controversial political views. The course itself, while offering an excellent screening list, is inadequate to provide students with the necessary analytical tools for critiquing film.
Professor Dabashi is indeed colorful and dramatic and the course is from afar, a good idea, but his syllabus needs to be revamped and so do his lecture notes. It didn't help that he decided to take three whole weeks off and let his TAs, who did their best to substitute for him, run the course.
I was put off by his personality (very haughty) and by his sweeping generalizations about american and european films. i will admit that he did (twice) deliver excellent lectures, but these were exceptions, and when he is in a good mood (again, hardly a trend) he can be approachable and even supportive.

Sidorsky's lectures are a pleasure to hear. He is old, and sometimes he speaks slowly, but he has a profound understanding of the texts and is good at explaining them using his own examples. Furthermore, he has an encyclopedic knowledge of literature, and he weaves references to art, culture, and science into his lectures, thereby connecting the class material to other disciplines. Besides being informative, it is fun to watch his intellectual acrobatics: in one class he quoted the beginning of the Canterbury Tales in Middle Enlgish, a passage from Isaiah in biblical Hebrew, and listed a dozen Roman emperors in chronological order with their corresponding prime numbers (hmm, this sounds a bit crazy, but there was a point to it all). I gather from CULPA that Sidorsky has a reputation for repeating himself, but don't worry, this is not unselfconscious repetion. He goes over important points from the previous lecture at the beginning of most classes--something I found quite helpful. So take a class with Sidorsky while you still can.

I really enjoyed Martin Eisner's class.  Aside from being very intelligent, as well as a nice guy, his knowledge of the material was inpiring.  His classes were a good mix of guided discussion and lecture.  This class holds students to a higher standard - he treats you like an adult and expects you to work hard in his class. My friends and I found ourselves working late, happily so, not wanting to let Martin down.  Martin can be brutally honest, but never malicious.  A great teacher - if you want the kind of class you supposedly came to Columbia for, this one is for you.

A little more reading than most of my friends, but not too bad.  Martin's own additions to the syllabus were some of the best reading all year.  A few short papers; open ended topics calling for a highly focused response.  I liked doing the papers for this class.

Frankly, Barnard should really tenure this brilliant woman.

Best professor in the English Dept., hands down. He went to Columbia, and the summer before his senior year he read The Lord of the Rings and decided med school just wasn't happening. He became an English major, and fell in love with fantasy, magical realism, fable, myth, and Romanticism. He quotes passages without opening the book, and feels personally let down and disappointed if you don't love his books as much as he does (but he'll never say so).
He's thoughtful, kind, and genuinely interested in what you have to say.  He unfortunately is a little too interested, and puts up with a lot of silly opinions from students in his class. Classes included reading Tolkein aloud on the lawn. His analysis of the literature is precise, fascinating, and inspiring, and he will make you love it, too.

Her passion for the subject is evident with each lecture; her deep knowledge of the texts is clear by each of her articulate discourses.

I highly recommend her lecture(s) and seminars.

I was enthusiastic about taking this class since it covered so many great classics - Moby Dick. Walden, etc, as well as incorporating more marginal voices such as Harriet Jacobs's Life of a Slave Girl.
Be warned, however, that Prof Gordis will spend much of the class talking about extant theories and interpretations of the books without often engaging the class itself in fruitful discussion.  Basically, she doesn't make the class engaging enough - partly due to her style of teaching, partly due to the way we rush through the works.

Eric is extremely arrogant, rude and very pretentious.  He is very unorganized and he enjoys writing in the most illegible handwriting ever. Then if you don't understand it he says, ""just bear with me here. I'm going to make this really hard and then really easy..."" and then keeps going. The main problem I found with Eric was that he will take one student who seems to be getting it and measure the rest of the class according to him.  Unfotunately for me and the rest of the people who  were seeing the concepts for the first time, Eric glossed over us completely without a second thought. 
 If that wasn't bad enough he also uses these random obscure notations such as C.D... but don't get him started on what they mean because he will give a ten minute explanation involving some greek fable about Echo the nymph, just to prove that he is not only a genius in math but also extremely well versed in the humanities. When he finally decides to go back to his really imcomprehensible explanation of limits, he once again basks in the jargon of ""sufficiently arbitrarily close..."" but never explains the concept.  
I worked really hard in his class and tried to meet with him during office hours but he was NEVER there. 
I'm usually not this unkind to anyone but honestly I still harbor a lot of anger for Eric because he ultimately really screwed me over in terms of completely my other requirements because I was so lost by the first midterm that I had to drop his class. 
Honestly, I know I sound bitter but I wasn't the only one who got screwed. I know at least three other students who were taking this class to fulfill econ and pre-med requirements who also ended up dropping it in order to save their GPA and their sanity.

Todd for the most part is a nice guy. He tried to be funny and make the material somewhat interesting with random information and history on the music and artist being discussed. However the major problems with this class come in two forms. One Todd beign the typical artist don't like to put limitations or boundardies on anything, in other words, he doesn't have a straight answer for anything and likes to make his students figure it out for themselves. This means you're on you own for figuring out what to study for the midterm and final, you'll have no idea what the format is and you'll also be clueless as to what the hell the structure is supposed to be for your papers. The second problem with this class is because of the fact that is is rather technical. If you don't have any background in music, you'll have quite a bit of studying to do in order to get a good grade. Luckily, most people fail the midterm and final so the professor had to use a curve.

This woman has the absolute best pedagogical method of any professor IÂ’ve had in my years at Columbia. She is measured and focused and will always come to class with a meticulously planned discussion which make the 2 hours of class fly by orÂ…at least, pass by tolarably (Incidentally, when spending 2 hours discussing Goethe death poems, it takes a pedagogical wizard a la Kelly Barry to make this happen). She expects students to do the work fully but itÂ’s completely understandable! This is one teacher who is actually conscious of the fact that students take more than one class. One reviewer said that initially she can come off as being a bit cold. I can see that. But watching her try to suppress the tiny fires of passion in her eyes when she is discussing a Goethe text make the class completely worth while. Also, if youÂ’re studying German as a major or concentration, she will show a vested interest in your success both professionally and academically. Kelly Barry ist prima!

It is true that, unlike other classes, where you really have to work to NOT get an A, in this class, a lot of work is required for it, but the class is also unique in that you leave each session knowing a hell of a lot more than you came in knowing.  It is true as well that Besserman does most of the talking, but what's the gripe there?  His brain, I promise, is the fullest.
Now, I confess that I am old-fashioned in certain respects, but it seems to me that one ought to judge the value of a course on the amount and quality of knowledge one takes away from it, not on the perceived fairness of the grade conferred. It also seems to me that the proper response to a professor who covers a lot, rather than a little, would be gratitude, not indignation.  Would you prefer to know less?  If so, maybe Besserman's not the guy for you, but note: that's YOUR problem, not his.

Avoid courses where TAs grade your work. They grade extremely hard. He gives the option of attending a discussion section and then each of your papers and your final will count less when calculating your end grade. While this sounds ideal, do not do it. 
While you may think that it will be easy to get an A in the discussion section it is not worth it because if you are in a discussion section your TA will grade your papers. The TAs grade unfairly. If you are not in a discussion section, while the papers and tests will count more, you are more likely to do better on them, because Professor Berghahn will grade the papers himself, which is ideal.

Eric Simring in THE GREATEST grad-student to ever teach Mathematics at Columbia.  Not only does he know his math, he can also relate it to a multitude of different subjects--including the humanities.    Okay, so he sometimes makes me say ""LETS DO SOME MATH ALREADY"" because he tends to digress deeply into an unpredictable but very interesting abyss!  But he always gets the job done.  Somehow, someway, he gets the job done.  Not only that, he has office hours, you can catch him at the Barnard Help Room, you can schedule to meet with him privately (believe me, he's good for it), and he offers 2,3, and even 4 outside-of-class reviews per semester.  He gives out handouts, he teaches you what's behind the math instead of merely showing you how to do something without fully understanding and thus setting you up for failure, and he has totally revolutionized the way of presenting the material by focusing on proofs and concepts instead of on problems.  To anyone who is studying at Columbia: whether you like math or not, whether you need to take it or not, take a class with Eric Simring!  You will learn more math than you have ever learned, you will laugh all semester at his bizarre humor (he once climbed the chalked board to demonstrate his mountain climbing abilities), you will make a great friend and you will witness someone who genuinely is burned on mathematics!

The material is really interesting, I think my father will never be convinced that there is no such thing as a hot hand or streak shooting in basketball, depite the psych literature, but Im gonna enjoy trying to convince him. The readings make you think about the world around you, the labs give you a chance to be scientific, play researcher, explore cutting-edge topics pretending you have an endless grant. And Trisha, a sweet woman, who explains complex topics very simply, if you took a previous thinking and decision-making course, or any of the cognition courses the topics shouldnt be completely unfamiliar and she and the TA wre more than willing to stay late, reply to emails, or repeat material the next class if people were confused. Trisha's research in the field is very interesting, i think one of the best classes was when she talked about her theories and let us be her guinea pigs. Also, register with your friends! you are the subjects in alot of the work you do, trust me youll want more data, the more ppl in the class, the more you can do. Whether youre headed to business sch (behavioral economics is discussed) or a psych PhD program, or you just plain want to know how ppl think ( and come up with some theories about how to manipulate them) this is a valuable class, and NOT TOO MUCH WORK for the 4 pnts.

Lise is a really nice person and a very good teacher. She is always willing to help out students, and is extremely accomodating if you need to take an exam early or late, etc. The class is really fun and you will learn a ton. I suggest taking it first semester, while you are in the fall semester of Intro to Molecular Bio (C2005), because the material from each class fits together nicely, and both classes are a little bit easier as a result of it.

Prof Bernstein, while maybe a little awkward, is actually quite a nice person.  I recommend taking a seminar with her rather than a lecture.  In larger classes, she presents material somewhat slowly and rather undynamically.  However, when in a small class oriented towards discussion, she is a good facilitator, providing clear contructions of authors' arguments and interesting interpretations of them.  Also, if you come prepared with questions, you will really benefit from her thorough knowledge of the material and willingness to guide you through difficult stuff.  She's also a fairly easy grader.

Eric Simring is a great teacher. Is his class hard? You bet. It is Calculus after all and this is Columbia University. You will be expected to work, but that doesnÂ’t mean it is impossible. 
EricÂ’s efficacy is in being able to communicate with his students in a friendly manner while explaining difficult material. If you are looking for a light load, however, choose another teacher because he loves homework. He insists that only through practice will you be able to understand the material. And, although he is right, the homework load can be quite unbearable at times. Still he allows you to hand in the material when you are finished (as in late) and without penalty. He works hard to accommodate all his students to hand in late assignments and missing exams.

This class was by far the best Economics course I have taken at Columbia.  Her tests were very fair, but you must go to class to understand the material.  The problem sets were difficult, but if you take the time to do them carefully the exams will be cake.  While Prof. Das does seem unapproachable at first once you talk to her you will realize that she really does care about her students.  It's refreshing to have a teacher that shoots down all of those annoying Econ major who ask stupid, annoying questions.  If you put the effort into the class you'll do well... if you're going to try to half-ass your way through it you may be in for a rude awakening.  Highly recommended.

After the first lecture, with his cool little movie about Havemeyer and little demos with fire, I thought Prof. Fine would be an awesome professor, but by the second lecture, I realized I was wrong. First, his lectures make no sense and I really wonder if he is still teaching because the Chemistry department pities him. Also, he would ramble on and on about the fricking nobel prize, politics or whatever else was on his mind for 20 minutes in lecture.  That will not help me on the MCAT, so please Prof Fine, do your job and teach Chemistry. And finally, he is arrogant and he does not respect his students and really does not care about them at all. 
The exams were torture because he would ask questions about random things he said in lecture, he would throw material on the exam we were not required to know and his questions were poorly phrased, with plenty of run on sentences and more ramblings. Expect questions like ""well if I throw some sugar and salt in the air and they land in a bowl, tell me the percent weight of Cl-?""  I was actually able to get an A but I didn't see that grade because Fine a) calculated everyone's grades wrong and b) he normalized our means with the means of Prof. Turro and Ann McDerment, who gave their classes exams that were insanely easy and straightforward. 
Unfortunately, being a post bacc I had to take this class, but just to give everyone a head's up, Columbia's teaching of Gen Chem is horrible and the faculty is very inept. I learned more when I took GChem at UChicago because I actually had to learn how to use the Schrodienger Equation, my profs didn't ramble about bullshit, it was all problem based, and we had exams that were not multiple choice. My final words of wisdom, go to lecture even though sitting through one is a bitch and a half, outline the chapters and do every single problem you can get your hands on. Otherwise, take this lecture with Turro or McDerment and stay away from Fine!

What to say about Professor Tuts. I will say that he is a good lecturer, I absolutely hate physics but Professor Tuts was able to make the class fly by with his little jokes about his bald spot and whatnot. In the beginning of the semester, I actually believed that he was probably the greatest science professor I ever had because for someone having 2 Ph D's, is a graduate of MIT, and is a brilliant physicist, he was able to ""dumb"" down the material and present physics on a level that everyone could understand, which for someone like me, was great. All the changed after our first exam, which was brutal.  No matter how hard you study, do practice problems and ace the problem sets, you will not be prepared for the exam. The exams are so beyond the scope of the course that  you will feel like you're a moron and have no right to either be a science major or a pre - med. And Professor Tuts seems to take the stance that we are a bunch of retards, even though most people that I know in the class, know and understand physics (including myself) but can't do his exams. That's just plain unfair. This year, his exams were brutal in comparison to the past two years.  Also, just one side note, when the TA's look at the exam and can't do the problems, something is wrong. 
Though I have to say, Tuts is very generous when it comes to grades and even if you score about 15 to 20 points below the mean, you still have a B-, which is nice and I do feel that I am prepared for the MCAT because I've suffered through his ""Physics Olympics"" exams and MCAT physics is not bad when compared to Tuts. Also, Tuts is willing to hold office hours and I hear he is very helpful, but Tuts is also aloof and a bit of an ass. He once looked through a student's test after the student handed it in, and laughed at it, which I thought was pretty cruel. If you're really good at physics or totally clueless like me, I think Tuts is a good match because his explanations and derivations are very clear but be prepared to be a little sore after the exams are over.

A very smart professor who thinks that everyone in his class should be as smart as him. After all, he's from MIT, and he has yet to realize that Columbia is no MIT!!!

He comes to class, coffee in hand, but unprepared and gives impromptu lectures, writing stuff on the board as it comes to his head.

Take this class if you want to have a class which you wont attend after the first one. Seriously, after going to one or two, you will realize that there is no logical reason to attend thic class. First of all, it is extremely boring, not only the professor, but also the stuff she teaches. Secondly, she goes from slides and posts all the slides to courseworks, so youll know what you are missing before the exams. And laslty, she posts practice exams, which are identical to the actual exams, only the numbers in the questions are changed (if there is no number to be changed in that question, youll see the exact question.) By the way all exams including the final are multiple choice (Man this class is really a joke).

     I wonder how this man came to teach at Columbia. I suppose he must have some talent, an expertise in Italian literature perhaps, but he is by far the absolute worst teacher I have ever had in any subject. Now, for the record, I'm getting an A, so it's not that I'm bitter about my grade. I'm bitter that after working as hard as I did to get into Columbia, I would have to sit in a class four times a week, listening to Prof. Bellati speak about whatever comes into his head, and then teach myself Italian at home. I thought we were supposed to have the best of the best teaching here. Bellati emphatically proves this wrong. 
     One of the things that upset me the most is his assertion that he ""teaches to the test."" First off, this isn't a good way to teach anything, especially not a language Â–teachers are accused of something that he openly admits to. Secondly, he doesn't even do that well -he consistently attempts to teach the class something he has never so much as mentioned in the last ten minutes of a class and then puts it on a quiz  the next day. 
     Prof. BellatiÂ’s assignment of homework is simply ridiculous. He is completely inconstant in every way. He will assign 15 exercises one night, and nothing for the three nights after. More than half of the exercises he assigns he will forget about and never go over. Disorganized and incompetent are the only words that describe his teaching.
    I know this review is getting long, but I couldnÂ’t write about Prof. Bellati without mentioning Dante Â–in possibly the worst teaching tactic ever, Prof. Bellati insists that you memorize a section of DanteÂ’s Inferno, citing that it will help your pronunciation and you will be able to Â“impress your friends with your Dante.Â” By forcing students to memorize it, the focus of what could be a half-decent exercise, shifts from pronunciation to remembering the words. ItÂ’s a huge waste of time.

Great lecturer--very organized and gives a clear and comprehensive presentation--she'll have you writing for the full 75 minutes.  She gets a little too caught up in ""professors across the street"" but her skills are up to par.  Reading list is quite extensive but you don't need to do more than skim the articles.  She scared a lot of people in the class by saying she ""didn't give As"" which means that the two take-home midterms (5-7 pgs) are graded on a curve (I'd never heard of a Poli Sci curve but apparently the TAs are only allowed to give 20% As).  Not to worry, if you get a reasonable TA, all the other papers get a grade of B or B+.  My only complaint about the class is the TA sections--poorly organized and completely pointless but unavoidable, the TAs take attendance that counts for 10 % of your grade.  The newer material at the end of the course is pretty interesting--she actually gives a few lectures on bio/chemical weapons, terrorism, and the Wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (most courses that intend to make it to the present day don't make it past the 80s).  Overall she's a pretty good authority on the major topics in IR, and manages to give a nearly unbiased view of all the material (very rare for a Poli Sci teacher).  I would certainly recommend taking IR with her.

I really appreciated Dr. Kammrath's thorough knowledge of the material and her willingness to impart this knowledge on her students. She always took time for questions and explained everything very clearly to the class. However, I cant deny that there were times when I was less than enthused to attend her class. She goes over a lot of studies to prove each theory, which in my opinion, got a little boring...in fact I was known to fall asleep for extended periods of time in class. She is a big fan of Powerpoint and as a result her lectures can be very detailed. The benefit of this is that she includes all the relevant information from the text book making it easy to suceed on her exams without ever having read from the text book.

Although I can see how the other reviewers got to the opinions that they got, I don't think that they fully describe him. Simon is a smart guy who is  very knowledgable about what he's talking and this usually includes insight as to what is good to use outside of academia (thanks to his industry experience).
On a personal level, I wouldn't recommend him as a good professor. Long story short he generally lacks patience with students and tends to look down on them. He's the only professor I've seen at Columbia who curses regularly in class. But if you can look past his teaching style, you will be able to learn some things that you can use in the real world out there.

Eugene is a fantastic teacher.  I can only agree with the only other review of him.  He is a little quarky, but it only adds to the flavor of the class.  You can tell that he is passionate about what he is doing, and it truly is engaging.  You go into class after having done the readings, and you find out a whole new way to think, a way to analyze.  You learn theories, you learn concepts, you learn!  This is not a high school english class, it is completely about learning how to think!  And in the end how to find your own voice.  It is a shame that what I learned there is not appreciated in other classes.  Because after his class I truly began to learn how to write.  I was able to understand a sense of purpose in each sentence and the sentence construction.  That is to say, nothing was written without my strong belief that it should be written.  It has been the single greatest experience I have had in school so far.  I just was intoxicated by the subjects we discussed.  I spent more hours working on one essay than I probably did working on all essays in my previous 'english' classes.   I can only hope that all the rest of my classes could be like this.  Eugene is engaging, truly brilliant, and if you thought going to class was fun, it is even better to go in during his office hours and talk about your essays.  He is fantastic one-on-one  During his office hours, time passes so quickly as you get off on tangents on literature, literary theory, writing, what it means to write.  Learning is fun with Eugene.
He will make a fantastic professor one day.  I say if you can get a class with him...take it.  If he is TAing in a class...take it.  You will not regret it.

Don't believe what everyone else had said about Qazi being a lab nazi, Qazi is probably the best thing the chemistry department has going for it. I will not lie to you guys, he is a hardass, his quizzes are hard, and his accent (at first) is hard to decipher, but the man truly does care about his students and if you go to him for help, he will help you because he loves his students. Qazi approached me on two occassions before lecture and asked how the lecture was going for me and whether I felt he was doing a good job teaching. And if you see him while he's riding home on the 3 train, he actually says hello to you. If you pay attention in the lab lecture you will definitely learn something about chemistry because he teaches some finer points about say kinetics or colligative properties that were not addressed at all by Professor Valentini in my chem lecture. 
Be warned though, you have to study for the quizzes. Read the lab manual a couple of times, memorize definitions, formulas and do the practice problems and look at the solutions posted on the website. I cannot stress this enough because Qazi likes asking challenging questions and will pick out the tiniest details out of the lab manual and make a question out of it.

I agree that this course was pretty easy.  Prof. Billows takes his lectures almost straight from the textbook, so if you miss a class or skip a reading it's not the end of the world.  The lectures could get kinda dry sometimes, but make sure you pay attention when Billows talks about Athens; it is his specialty, and it can actually be pretty funny to observe his obvious bias against all other greek cities.  He has a really dry sense of humor, but you might miss his jokes and sarcastic remarks if you don't pay attention. He doesn't like to be interrupted when lecturing, so prepare to be shot down when you offer comments or questions, especially if you say something uncomplimentary to the Athenians.  The worst part of the course was that he honestly went at least 10 minutes overtime for EVERY SINGLE CLASS. Overall, an interesting course with a relatively light workload, and taught by a professor who definitely knows his subject.

Jenny is a wonderful instructor to teach intro to Modern dance.  This is a 9:10 class and I still missed only one session, regardless of the hour I stayed up until the night before or the amount of work I had for the next day (unprecedented for me).  Jenny teaches the Graham technique and will use a lot of silly metaphors to get you to understand what she wants from you, but in the end you will walk away from the class much more aware of what your body can do, where the movement can be initiated.  Do yourself and others a favor if you happen to think that over-enthusiasm is corny and don't sign up for this class.

For all ChemE's:  this class, along with Transport I, will kill your GPA first semester of junior year, at least in my experience.  Thermodynamics in general is just a tough subject, and Durning certainly doesn't make it any easier.  He is a fairly nice man, although sometimes he comes off as an a**hole, but he just cannot explain the concepts very well.  The midterm and final basically determine your grade in the class, and both are fairly difficult, but made even more difficult by his picky grading.  My advice is do all the reading, all the homework problems, and most of all, do the practice problems he recommends before the exams.  Many times they come up on the real exam, word for word!  Text:  ok, somewhat difficult to read.

In my honest opinion, I found Professor Valentini to be alright, wasn't the best professor I ever had and he wasn't the worst. After having Len Fine my first semester of G.Chem, I was relieved that Valentini's powerpoint presentations were clear, organized and informative and that he generally gets them up on the website with a day or two after lecture. The lecture generally consisted of Valentini opening the floor to some ""stupid"" (his words) questions about the material, he would crack a couple of jokes about his unpopularity with the undergrads that didn't come to lecture, would do a couple of demonstations and then he would lecture for the remaining period of time. The material is very boring and that was reflected in Valentini's lectures. Again, not the worst professor in the world, but at the same time, he would lecture on a topic for one or two lectures and would rush through the ""real chemistry"" and then he would spend what seemed like hours on irrelevant material such as testing the pH of dodge's pool. I would have preferred if the ""practical applications"" of chemistry were done away with and that we had more in class practice with questions and that more of the textbook material done were presented lecture. 
Our exams consisted of 25 multiple choice questions and I felt our first exam was very unreasonable. It was long, difficult and did not reflect the material we learned or were responsible to know for the exam. He doesn't curve the class and his grading ranges are too rigid. Overall, a much better professor than Professor Fine, but can bore you to death in lecture and seems a little unsympathetic regarding the difficulty of his exams. (Most people did not finish our first exam in 75 minutes (including myself) and when told that the exam was a little too long for the time alotted, all he could say was ""well you should be able to do that exam in 35 minutes""). Most people said he was personable and approachable, I felt he was a little indifferent at times.

So boring it was depressing and tiresome even to think about going to class. Nevertheless, I attended the majority of the lectures (I'm a masochist) and was delivered about the same result every time: a professor who was unanimated, uninteresting, and completely obsessed with the mathematical approach to everything.

Professor Ferguson is amazing.  At Columbia I've had very few classes that are actually taught, rather than being led by class discussion.  He asks for our input every once and a while, but not often, which is good since he is brilliant.  He is very professional and has the class planned out to the last second.  He also makes a huge effort to get to know the students, going as far as to request photos and bios from us the first day of class. 
   The class itself is incredibly good.  We took about 7 weeks to read through Moby-Dick, concentrating more on the philosophical impact than anything else.

Reading these other two reviews, I began to wonder if they were talking about the same Kim who was my lab instructor for night chemistry. Unlike the other two reviewers, I found Kim to be rather unhelpful, a little bit snotty and unfair as she would pay more attention to the guys in the lab than us girls. People would stroll into lab 30 minutes late and hold the entire class back and she would just let things go, but if you forgot to wash your hands as soon as you took off your gloves or accidentally cut yourself on a piece of glassware (like my lab partner did one night), you would get a ten minute lecture. Sure, I don't really want a TA that is way too strict and a hardass, but at the same time, when I spend 4 to 5 hours a week preparing my procedure, AT HOME, like we are supposed to, and someone else is allowed to write up their procedure in class or have Kim do their lab for them, without being penalized, that's just unfair and unprofessional, IMHO.

I read the positive reviews about Eric and noticed that the negative reviews have been pulled.  Some people thing he is great.  Other people disagree.  He is a nice man, but he is not a good teacher.  He is irresponsible.  He talk too much about himself.  He wastes class time.  Then he rushes through the math.  He gives very hard tests and lots of homework.  And he does not cover a lot of the material in class.  It takes him a long time to give back corrected homework.  So you can be making mistakes all along and not know it.  He announced in class that someone wrote a bad review about him on CULPA.   He is a nice guy but a bad teacher.

First, let us get one thing straight: Michael Golston is the man. That being said, we can go into the specifics. He has an incredible presence in class; he employs effective body language and facial expressions to convey his point. To take an extreme but comedic example, one day Prof. Golston was explaining Freud's notion of the id, and he decided to demonstrate the effect of the unsuppressed id if he was craving a hamburger. So he naturally threw a desk aside and leapt toward a classmate, (who was holding an imaginary burger) he yelled ""Gimme your [explitive] hamburger."" That, he explained, is the unsuppressed id, and our ability to suppress it, according to Freud, is one of the defining factors of our humanness. 
He mediates class excellently by interpreting and elaborating on the points that students make. He also knows a lot of random but fascinating facts that always liven up class.

I agree with the other reviewers - Flynn is really great guy.  The first midterm was tough as hell - I thought I did so bad that I'd be dropping, but so did almost everyone else.  Plus I found out that he drops the lowest score at the end.  For the second and third midterm, I attended lectures more often but didn't find them too helpful.  I will say, though, he is about as entertaining as a chemistry lecturer can be and he's smart as hell.  When you're following him, the lectures can be pretty interesting.  I feel like I understand the ""how"" behind the formulation of the equations instead of just the equations.  (like in the equation for frequency of collisions between gas molecules at a section of a wall, all of the numbrs and multiples in the equation make sense as opposed to just the concept).  
For the second and third midterm, I did ALL of the homework problems twice.  They help so much.  If you know how to solve all the homework problems, you'll do well on the exams.  Not only are the ideas in the test questions all taken from the homework directly or indirectly, some problems are always reproduced exactly.  There is, however, a frustrating challenge problem on every test.  Despite my prep for the 2nd and 3rd exam, the challenge problem got me both times but I did do a little above average.  I was ready to get a B+, but then I studied even harder for the final again just by doing homework problems, killed the final, and got a straight A.  He gave about 40% A-range grades in Fall 2003, and probably around 25% regular A's.  This curve is SO much more generous than regular G-chem, which I think is about 20% A-range grades.  However, the students in the class are much better at chem than G-chem, but this one is still a better deal, both for grading and because you only have to take one semester!

Bill Ryan is a kind, passionate, intelligent man.  He cares deeply about environmental issues and about his students understanding the material.  If you ask him a question, he will stick with you and teach you until you understand.  Briliant, but never arrogant.  
That said, Solid Earth is an extremely time-consuming class.  Much of the material is interesting, but it is presented in a way that feels almost like leap-frogging from subject to subject each week.  The labs are ridiculous, data-heavy, spreadsheet-heavy, time-consuming ordeals.  Fortunately, in Fall 2003 we had a fantastic TA- Janet Baran- who really made the experience much better.  As another reviewer said, Baran and Ryan together made the course a good experience.    They both deserve teaching awards.

Carnes is not a god, but he's a good professor.  Before class each day he has a coffee hour in Mac where you can stop by and chat about the course.  If you think you can do this and suck up, don't bother; faceless TAs grade you and he never remembers faces.  But, it is a good opportunity to ask questions about his speedy lectures. I thought the readings were really well-written and interesting, although I realized at the end that you didn't have to do them  His tests are unfair because they don't assess your knowledge, but he gives sample exams from the past, so just memorize the answers to those exams and you'll do great.  If it wasn't for messing up one chronology on the midterm, I would have gotten an A/A-, instead I got a B-BECAUSE OF ONE QUESTION THAT TESTED MY KNOWLEDGE OF EVENTS THAT WERE A FEW DAYS APART. But, Carnes knows that his tests are unfair, and so if you do better on the final he discounts the midterm.  Overall, Carnes' humor, insight, and vivacity made this class worthwhile and very do-able.  I'm very glad I took it because I learned a lot about US history that I didn't learn in h.s.  Just one piece of advice-memorize the dates he gives you for the exam (its really easy to do), and do not answer the chronologies, ever, no matter how much you think you know it.

The class this semester consists of 3 types of students. Those that have already taken calculus, those that have not, and those married to a math major. Those that have taken calculus before or are married to a math tutor think that eric is ""The Man."" Those that are at the level you are suppose to be for an introductory calculus class are struggling and frustrated. 2 of the first 3 classes eric did not bother to attend which immediately put most of the class in a hole (except for those that dropped which was approximately half the class, we started at about 30 and are now at 15). Class begins at 6:10pm, eric stops talking about himself and begins instructing at 6:25pm(at the earliest). So, you pay for at least 15 minutes of every class to hear about how awesome he is. He allows one of the students to answer every question that he poses to the class, which accelerates the class to the pace of a review. The students that have already taken calculus seem to like this because it allows more time for rhetoric, instead of instruction. The department decided not to include section 2.4 ""the precise definition of a limit"" in the curriculum. Eric added it back in for us because he wants us ""to know calculus the best!"" Well, the result is that we spent two valuable weeks on this section, which is the most difficult concept in the book(that is why the other professors decided to leave it out), and adding these 2 weeks to the classes he didn't attend in the beginning of the semester and those during the semster and all his latenesses - our class is now far behind the other classes. It is now 2 weeks before finals and he has alot of material we need to cover before the final, which means we get a very unreasonable amount of time to learn alot of new material. With this rush coming, how does Eric respond? He didn't bother to show up for class this past wednesday 4/14/04. A girl showed up and said he was sick. Coincidentally, he was scheduled to leave for vacation after class that evening. During the lectures he usually goes off on tangents that have very little or nothing to do with the subject. These constant distractions increase the difficulty of absorbing the material. To compound this, our homeworks are not given back until at least 2 weeks after they are handed in(our first 3 homework assignments were given back to us during the 6th week of classes far beyond the time we were discussing the material in class). Eric gives enormous homework assignments(HUGE) to make up for his lack of effort in class. And then has the nerve to suggest that you should only be spending 4 hours a week on the homeworks. The lectures are on a section in the book, the homeworks are on 4 or 5 sections of the book. He seems to pride himself on writing illegibly and very quickly. He enjoys jumping around the class room from blackboard to blackboard twisting you around to try and follow what he is saying. No one that has not previously taken calculus will be leaving this class prepared for calculus II. Unless they are married to a math major. If I knew my semester was going to go this way I would have bought the book, taught myself and tested out of the requirement. The funny thing is, is that that is exactly what I am doing. Only difference is the $3,000 that I paid to Columbia to learn that Eric is ""The Man!"" Also, the reviews written previously about how great eric is were written by students that have previously taken calculus. I know them, I sit next to them in class and I have heard all their stories. Eric came into class on Monday 4/12/04 and told everyone not to read CULPA because of a bad review. So their glowing reviews about Eric are only in response to the negative review written previously. The saddest part about this whole thing is that he is lowering people's GPA's by forcing them to take so much time away from their other studies to make up for his lack of effort in class. And the only students that are going to receive an A in his class are the one's that are taking calculus for the second time(these students shouldn't even be in the class to begin with, I guess it's not their money they are spending). I have to go now because I have a lot of homework to do. Good thing I can hand it in late? I want you to realize that I have NOT written ALL of what Eric has done against us this semester. And neither have the other reviewers. I am just in shock that a university that claims to be of such a high standard as Columbia would allow an instructor to get away with this type of conduct. Eric likes to chyme in about how difficult his professors were at Berkeley. I bet they showed up for class. Possibly even taught for the full 75 minutes.

In the nine writing classes I've taken at other colleges and at columbia, I haven't come across a teacher who is so sensitive towards other people's writings, and still manages not to suck up to students so they'll like him. He is delightfully awkward, but always interested in encouraging you to find a voice or develop what you already had.

The fact that Violi is a wonderful and distinguished poet himself just goes to show what little interest he has in being a typical university professor.

Rosenthal is a teacher with an intimidating ego, but the skills to back it up.  You probably won't be able to find a Lit Hum prof that teaches the material as well as Rosie.  He is more than qualified, and teaches the class because he loves it.  Don't plan on skipping his class, he takes attendance very seriously.

I would agree with the previous reviewer- I learned next to nothing from this class.  Or rather, what I learned, I learned on the very first day- Professor Bock essentially repeated the same lecture over and over for an entire semester.  Students would joke about ""preparing for yet another day of review"".  With all that time taken up by mind-numbing repetition, it's easy to see how other vital topics will get overlooked.  Gould's theory of punctuated equilibrium is (mean-spritedly) discussed -and dismissed- in about half an hour, towards the end of the semester.

Eric is ridiculous, and if you have never taken calc before don't take his class.  There are several students who have taken a similar course (as recently as last semester at another school) and he makes the exams for them.   Class is also conducted for thier sakes because he hates to stop whatever he is doing to explain to those of us who have never taken calc before.  
The class is confusing, he speeds through the material and spends the class time talking about things that have nothing to do with math.  To make matters worse, he rarely shows up for office hours and has missed 4 or 5 classes so far this semester.  We have two weeks of class left and two chapters to cover.

This class was a joy.  I loved going, and thought prof patterson did a tremendous job simplifying and breaking down topics that are really complex, without talking down to you.   Its true, the problem sets are a little bit a of a stretch, and he doesn't always refer to what they cover directly in lecture.  But the midterm was totally reasonable, very fair with a good curve.  I think prof patterson is adorable, he makes me laugh outloud in class, and he even gives the people prizes (candy, random trinkets) for answering his questions.  He's enthusiastic, smart, and laid back.  And hey, the subject matter is really cool. It will definitely give you material to wow people at cocktail parties.  I think its a great choice to fulfill the science requirement...esp the single one, cause you dont need to have taken the previous class in the sequence to understand this one.

Wow, is this class ever boring.  And hard.  Bailey seems like a fairly nice person ,and one gets the feeling that his efforts to succeed as an instructor are sort of ""cute"" but by the end he's totally annoying.  He speaks in a monotone, and a soft monotone at that.  He isn't a fan of eye contact.  And he gives you a packet of the notes at the beginning of every class that he basically just reads from the whole time.  These aren't handwritten spotty notes, but pages of paragraphs gleaned from the textbook he appears to be writing.  So, you feel like you shouldn't have to take notes, but the packets are fairly difficult to breakdown on your own, so you probably should.  
The most frustrating thing is that Bailey seems to enjoy being cryptic about tests and homework and questions in general.  When you ask reasonable questions as to the information you should focus on, he dodges them like nobody's business.  And while he is available for office hours, he doesn't actually like to go over the specific homework problems in detail.  He'll mention the sneaky math trick (use the Hamiltonian!) that you were supposed to miraculously divine, but he won't tell you when or where to use it.  Or he will respond to emails regarding tests with ""Don't worry.  The test will be fine,"" and then give everyone Cs.  He's just very difficult to really feel out.  And since his communication skills leave a lot to be desired (he speaks english perfectly, but he doesn't like to give clear/concise/useful answers about anything) you find yourself sort of swimming in a world of nebulous concepts - it's not particularly conducive to learning.  
And he expects you to know a lot of complicated math.  So, unless you're taking this class because you have to, don't do it.  The amount you learn isn't nearly worth the stress.  If you're taking it because you must, you'll survive but mostly due to your own efforts to learn the material on your own.
Finally, Bailey says that about 5 books are required for the course.  NONE OF THEM ARE - don't waste your money.  He writes all his own problem sets with the exception of a few problems from Griffiths (if you want a textbook, get this one), and the materials is exclusively from the notes he provides.
Workload:
More than you want, but you can handle it.  Weekly or every other week long-ish problem sets, 2 midterms and a final.  All the tests are hard and he likes to be vague as to what they will cover.

This is the best course I've taken in the engineering school, and Noyan may be the best professor I've had at Columbia.  The class is a whirlwind tour of everything you need to know about materials science (and since the rest of the classes in this department are so bad, this may be all you ever learn) and Noyan is a superb tour guide.  He is passionate, funny, enthusiastic, brilliant, straightforward, and a simply outstanding professor.  He does use powerpoint slides, but he only picks out the important stuff and is absolutely willing and capable of turning them off and teaching on the blackboard.  (He does so quite often for the harder derivations and things you should pay a great deal of attention to.)  He knows this material inside and out, loves questions from the gallery (even tangential ones), and really brings his real world engineering knowledge to the table in meaningful ways.  He's full of practical advice for life, for engineering, for basically everything - and all he wants is to share the knowledge with you.  He's totally interactive (there's no wall between the lectern and the students), and thus he can be a little intimidating at the start because he does like to drill individual students on the material from the previous week throughout the class.  It seems scary/embarassing/annoying but once you know what's going on, you find that his drilling has really made you get the material in your head.  And you understand it enough to explain it back to him.  It's awesome.
Even though the professor is swell, this class isn't a breeze just due to the sheer amount of material you have to get through. However, he's such a great teacher that if you just try a little, you'll learn a whole lot.  He tests you much more on understanding than application, so his tests are completely do-able from your notes (think essays explaining a concept rather than problems applying a concept) and getting a good grade is a likely possiblity.  
Basically, Noyan's engaging teaching style and amazingly comprehensive knowledge of just about everything ever makes this class everything typical SEAS classes aren't.  So, if you're up for a challenge and actually want to get something out of a class, Noyan's the man to help you do that.  Don't get fooled into majoring in MSAE because this class is great though - nothing on the MSAE track after this is half as good...

Bollinger's class was really worth taking.  The course is taught Socratic method (meaning he takes the enrollment list and calls on people at random) so you must do the reading.  But the reading is very manageable and he normally falls behind so you won't have to do reading for weeks at a time.  Bollinger explores the constitutional intricacies of the first amendment thoroughly, so if constitutional law isn't your thing it might be boring.

Bollinger knows his stuff and really expands your eyes about the reaches and contradictions in constitutional law.  Definitely recommend it to American Politics majors.

I want to say this was one of the best courses I have had at Columbia and I am appalled by the amount of negative reviews of this professor.  Professor Hart was one of the best lecturers I have ever had.  I am not a morning person by any means and I looked forward to every lecture, they were always interesting, and he found a way to make them all fun.  I think the majority of people don't like the course because few people got As- 28%.  Yes the course requires some work, but no one should graduate with a degree from this school without actually doing anything.  The work you will do is interesting and relevant.  The quizzes are a fairly easy way to boost your grade and it forces you to keep up with the reading.  The textbook isnt the greatest, but Prof Hart makes up for what it lacks.  I think the most off target review Ive read is someone saying that the two countries involved in the opium wars is irrelevant to anything in this course.  On the contrary one of the major themes in this course was how political decisions have colored the way we approach all drugs in this country.  All in All, Very interesting class with one of the coolest professors you will ever have the priviledge of taking a course with.

Now that I'm no longer in Ms. White's class, I miss it more than ever. 
I was lucky enough to get into Art Hum as a first year, and I completely loved my experience (I've always loved art, but this course solidified my plans to do an art history concentration). Ms. White did an incredible job of catering to everyone in the class, as some of her other reviewers have noted. She made sure to explain the basic concepts to those with little or no background in art history, while working with students who had more experience outside of class to make sure the material was interesting for them, as well. She even lent me one of her personal books for my University Writing papers, since I was writing on Andy Warhol. 
She was very flexible in terms of setting up review sessions, always extended her office hours, during which she welcomed both academic and non-academic conversation, and always made an effort to keep us awake, smiling, and appreciating the art. I never really cared for art before the 18th century before, but Ms. White gave me a newfound appreciation for it. 
One of the things most refreshing about Ms. White (aside from the delicious cider and cookies she brought about twice a month!) is the fact that she's not as jaded as many of the other Columbia grad students and professors. She is as willing to learn from her students as they are from her. This really helped foster a sense of classroom community and make you feel like your in-class comments were worth making. 
This semester, Ms. White even took me and a few of my classmates to some art gallery openings, which were really cool. Her unbridled passion for art was evident on this trip, as well as during the various museum visits we made as a class.

One problem with this Culpa free-for-all is that the people having the strongest opinions tend to be those who did poorly.  Reading the reviews above, I bet you wouldn't have guessed that PROFESSOR GROSS WAS GIVEN THE INSTRUCTOR OF THE YEAR AWARD, that he is (near) universally loved, that he is very much approachable and takes an eager interest in his students, and that his lecture style is nothing short of brilliant.  His explanations are lucid, his delivery entertaining.  Mostly, Prof. Gross gives a feel for why the material is important and interesting.  I don't mean this in the sense of practical applications of the material (though the training in combinatorics has certainly been useful in my current research), but important in a larger sense.  Professor Gross's goal is to make you (in his own words) ""become your own expert""- to teach you how to approach problems creatively, and with maximum rigor.  This class was probably the most influential one that I took in all my undergrad education.  You may or may not appreciate his jokes, but I strongly encourage people to take the class.

Professor Piccato actually does an impressive job of organizing the information and focusing on the most interesting things. At first he comes of as a little dull and pompous, but he is actually charming and has a great sense of humor. Tis true, the TAs do all the grading, including assigning the participation grade which is determined in the section meetings (hosted by the TAs). And sometimes the grading seems arbitrary but I came to realize that all they are interested in is accurate historical information, and if you don't have that then all the fancy rhetoric in the world won't save you.

Testa is a really nice guy, too bad his lectures are boring. Most of the class passes out in the first 15 min (even the most attentive students).

After the hearing stiff, member, shaft, and errect all in the same sentence multiple times, one can't help but let his/her minds wander and giggle just a little bit.

   As mentioned in other reviews, this class is very well-organized: Professor Evans states the goals of the course and sticks to them. He always has a printed lecture outline to guide him, and picks up exactly where he left off last class. 
   The courses themselves are interesting, at least for non-science folks who want a glimpse into the way scientists operate (think an even friendlier version of Hawking's /A Brief History of Time/). It takes a historical approach to physics, which means explaining how specific observations and experiments led to the formulation and reformulation of theories, complete with anecdotes. Evans also focuses on the philsophies and biases of scientists in their day and how that influenced the development of physics. Evans himself is genuinely enthusiastic about the subject, which helps. 
   The workload is amazingly light. If you attend the lectures, you never have to crack open a book. Then study the solutions to problem sets and the midterm study guides two or three hours before the midterm, and you'll get an A! Also, the math is not intimidating--three lines of calculations in the calculation problems, at most.
   The prof is /always/ present during office hours, and is happy to schedule meetings outside them.
   Cons: The class might seem too basic and boring for those who have a good grasp on the fundamentals of physics.

   Prof Lean is usually well-organized: she posts her lecture outline online before each class, and displays it on the projector as well. Her lectures usually reflect the ideas of the main textbook reading, a little of the supplemental texts, and occasional outside sources, with special emphasis on themes she will probably ask about on the midterm and final, and occasional outside material. While not especially unique in her views, she does a good job in conveying the information.
   What makes the course truly worth taking, however, are the required readings. Lean chooses the course's texts with an intelligent and discriminating eye: the readings are always enlightening, varied, and interesting. The load is heavy, but worth the time. I can say with all honesty that I feel I have a good understanding of Chinese culture because of it.
   In terrms of the workload... Each of the two papers has questions similar to those posed for discussion sections. Since the prof limits your sources to the required (and discussed, sometimes even during lecture) readings, it is not too difficult. The midterm and finals covered the 'big' themes covered in class, which Lean herself warns, so it's relatively easy to predict what will be asked.

Good Things About Professor Graham:
1. She is a really kind person.
2. She makes us read from a really good textbook
Bad Things About Her:
1. She does not know how to teach. She rambles and rambles hardly ever getting to the point. I learned more from the one class the TA Kate taught than I have from all of Prof. Graham's lectures combined. The only way to do well is to teach yourself the material on your own.

Segal's quality is community college level.  Yes, this class is easy, light readings, short papers, easy exams.  But it's not easy in a good way.  Segal will expect you to adore and worship Plato, even though in class he'll be dismissed as a proto facist.  And because Segal knows nothing at all about ancient history you won't be able to say that the Spartans treated women well, that the Romans freed their slaves, that both Greeks and Romans were anxious and uncomfortable with the practice of infanticide because Segal knows nothing about ancient history and he doesn't want to because it would interfere with his clean little theories that have developed absent of historical analysis.  Like the other reviewers have said, he is witty and intelligent, the class is lively and it's an easy A if you give him what he wants.  Don't, however, come to this class if you really want to engage the material -- Segal only wants you to engage his ideas about the material.  And his ideas, frankly, are isolated, poorly developed, and steeped in ignorance.

Professor Oryshkevich is truly a gem. Brillant is all I can say. After having spent some time at Columbia, I've learnt the distinction between someone who knows their stuff as opposed to someone who can actually teach. Professor Oryshkevich is both. What I find impressive is that when she asks a question and if the answer isn't what she is looking for, she is able to link the 'wrong' answer to the 'correct' answer. That has a profound impact, since it allows you to remember more vividly on what the material is about. I wouldn't say she is a lenient professor but she gives you chances to make up for your grade should you bomb any of the exams/essays. An A in this class is not easy. Be prepared to work your ass off, especially with the essays. An extremely friendly professor who will make the extra effort to help you outside her office hours. To me at least, your grade accurately reflects how much effort  you put into the course.

Professor Fan is a really nice professor. Unfortunately, I wish she would be more specific with the subject material. She tends to be very iffy. Iffy meaning an answer in a class discussion could swing either way. And that discussion normally comes up in the exams, which isn't helpful because the answer in the class discussion wasn't specific. The material we've been discussing does in a way, relate to Western Music, but I don't know what the significance of the field trips are, for example, the trip to the MIDI place and to the Ethnomusicology Center. It's confusing because although I can see how the two centers relate to the course, I don't know what's going to be on the exam. It's okay if the exam question is going to be: what's a MIDI? But if it's going to be: what's a patial, then I'm going to be like, huh?
I know this review will only make sense to the class who's been through this with me but the point is that if she can be more specific with what she wants from us, it will be really beneficial (to me at least). One good thing though was that Professor Fan had called in a choir group to demonstrate and explain parts of the course material at the beginning of the term (Josquin). That proved effective.

This 4 hour long class was extremely enjoyable, not only because of the wonderful films we saw in class, but because of Professor Regan's ever interesting lectures. Though the class is always very large, about 50 students, she runs it like a seminar. Everyone has ample opportunity to share their views. The readings, though copious, were enthralling. Though she did pick certain ""unoriginal"" films such as Citizen Kane, we also saw many films I'd never heard of. We went through everything from the silents, to expressionism, to genre films, to the french new wave and italian neorealism, to the avant garde movement, to the modern d.v. phenomenon and we ended with the Danish Dogma movement.

I'm gonna go out on a limb and say he has smoked a fair amount .  He basically lives on planet braverman, population: one.  This has both its blessings and its curses.  He is by and large not an engaging lecturer.  Either you like the texts and that what draws you in, or you stuggle for the better part of 45 minutes to keep your eyes open.  The texts are good.  I expected crap and was pleasantly surprised.  This is a good class to fill the pre-1800 requirement, not to mention you familiarize yourself with some otherwise forgotten authors.

Hans Martin Puchner, or Prof. Puchner to most, grows on you like that nerd you hated as a freshmen, but guiltily loved senior year.  His is overwhelmingly academic at times, and initially I found this both unengaging and off-putting.  Break through that facade though, and you'll find someone who just really loves his drama.  The texts were good, although a bit too much shaw for me.  His lectures didn't change my life or anything, but they were interesting.  He has a real love for the word 'ourve' and when he says it with his accent it's great.  I won't lie, that word kept me awake some thursday afternoons.  The class is laregly non-participatroy, which is great if you enjoy taking the occasional afternoon off.  Don't skip 4 classes on shaw, read only one shaw play, and then expect to not shit the bed on the midterm.  Ahem, I've been told this does not lead to success.  Plays are short though, so reading doesn't take long.  Overall a good class, but not one that will change your life.

He's good.  There's no doubt about that.  The texts are hard, but he's smart and personable so, violia, a good lecturer.  This class will fill all the holes CC left open, which in my case was about the size of the grand canyon.  But instead of creaming my pants about him like the other reviews, let me tell you about a few more interesting details.  The first two rows of the class are filled with eager hipster students, mainly girls, that lead up the bruce robbins fan club.  I wouldn't be surprised if they painted 'love me' on their eyelids like in Indiana Jones.  They do love him.  If that isn't entertainment enough for you, either sickening or enthralling, Robbins himself is a character and a half.  He read his first Sartre at 15.  Need i say more?  Academia is this man's life, and no one is better suited for it.  His witty arrogance is endearing.  One day he wore this crazy asian kimono/dress suit thing to class.  It looked ridiculous, but i'll bet he felt like a pig in shit.  I don't know what that was trying to tell you, but just take him for christ's sake.  he's the closest thing you'll get to an intellectual celebrity in the english department, and he's the best lecturer i've come upon.  And do love him.

Rosenthal is unbelievably smart.  If you are an English superstar or if you are looking for a teacher who is challenging and engaging, he is a great bet.  Though he lectures quite a bit, he steers the class away from that ubiquitous English class in which dumb students talk all the time and the teacher never says anything substantial about the books.  He doesn't give extremely specific comments on the written papers, and he is a pretty hard grader, so if you are looking for an easy A, this is not your guy.

His has an unbelievably dry sense of humor that matches his unbelievably dry teaching methodology.

What a nice guy!  What a bad teacher.  I completely agree with the previous review.  Bryan has the biggest heart of any professor I have had at Columbia.  He wants everyone to do well in his class and wants everyone to participate.  He even had our classroom changed so we could all sit in a circle to converse.  But he cannot lead a discussion to save his life.  His spanish is not amazing and sometimes difficult to listen to.  He tries not to lecture, which could have been a good quality to write about him, but since most of the class never read, the discussions were unbelievably painful to sit through...I could constantly hear crickets chirping the background.  He means well, but he really should've taught this course in English.  And he should've actually graded our one paper and handed it back with comments other than just grammatical corrections.

I don't think she's as mean as people claim because when she smiles her whole face lights up.  Mean people dont smile that way.  But she assigns a lot of reading material, takes attendence during every lecture (sign in sheet), politely requests that students not stuff their faces during lectures, and requests that students arrive on-time.  I think those are reasonable requests.  Habitually tardy students and food chompers are unbelievably annoying.

I did experience the love-hate relationship with the class that the other reviewer mentions, but in the end I am really glad I took the course.  It is intense, but it's rewarding.

The reviews about Prof Gersten are pretty harsh, perhaps a bit too harsh.  I don't think the class is nearly as bad as people make it out to be.  Definitely one of the better physics profs out there.  He knows his stuff and explains it well.
Yes, the textbook is just damn awful.  But this class does use the classic Sears, Zermansky and Young text which is in its 11th edition so someone must like the book.  Prof Gersten suggests alternative textbooks in the class syllabus - do yourself a favor and get one of them.
Prof Gersten tries to make the class interesting (material is somewhat boring).  Lectures are coherent and well organized.  He spends a bit too much time deriving formulas, but at least there are no proofs / derivations on the exams.  He cracks jokes and presents a good lecture the old fashioned way (blackboard) and doesn't use powerpoint or overheads.  Class is usually half empty because it is in the evening.  I have found him helpful in office hours.  The TA's for this class are also pretty good.  If you need an off sequence class this is about as good as it gets.  Exam questions are of practical nature and not theorectical ball busters that you usually get in a physics class.
Workload:
3 exams (2 mid-terms and final).  Homeworks are graded and may help in borderline cases  - I don't think so, but we'll see.  Exams are ok.  Not too hard.. average is around a 70-75 or so which is kind of high for physics.

I already wrote a glowing review of Professor Graham, but after reading some of the more recent reviews, I feel that it is time for another. As a psychology major, I have taken quite a few psychology courses. It is unbelievable how many psychology professors present their entire lectures using Power Point, reading their notes verbatim. Perhaps many of you have gotten so used to this wretched style of lecturing (if that is what it is called to read slides out loud) that when you come across a professor who actually teaches, you mistake it for rambling? I will save you from my spiel about how Power Point is killing teaching (and learning), and instead let me say this: Norma Graham is an amazing professor who truly loves to teach, who challenges you to think and read critically, and who will inspire you to think differently about science. Even if you plan to never take another psychology course again, take this class. With her genuine enthusiasm about psychology, with her attitude that science is about continuous questioning and careful investigation, and with her thoughtful approach to teaching, Professor Graham is one of the best professors you will come across in all your time at Columbia. She is definitely one of my favorites!

I wholeheartedly agree with the previous review. One of the worst classes I have taken, and one of the worst teachers I've ever had. For all the assignments, she never made it clear what she wanted. When we would get graded papers back, we would be downgraded for things that had never been mentioned in class before. She was often unprepared for class. She made assumptions about what we already knew, which were completely unfounded and wrong. She made us do in-class exercises that felt pointless, didn't go anywhere, and didn't relate to the graded assignments. 
You're not allowed to change UW sections unless you have a conflict. But, like the last review said, if you're assigned to be in Ms. Paramsad's class, you should definitely create a conflict to get out of it.
Workload:
Kind of a lot. You have to read about 7 long essays over the course of the semester; there are short ungraded writing assignments due every two weeks or so; and there are 4 long graded papers. The workload is pretty much the same in all UW classes, it doesn't depend on the teacher.

The fact that this man has managed to become a well known political scientist and is tenured at a place with people like Waltz and Jervis is just one of the universe's great mysteries.  As one reviewer pointed out, if you know ANYTHING about the regions he discusses, you will want to bang your head against your desk repeatedly because Baldwin seems to know very few accurate facts about the topic - you know, foreign policy?  His class on the Cuban Missile Crisis was in and of itself a great puzzlement.  The man does not seem to actually know in what years the Cuban Missile crisis took place.
The one redeeming thing about the class was a terrific TA.  Justine Rosenthal knew her shit, ran discussion sections smoothly and efficiently, and was very responsive and helpful, especially if you made the mistake of occasionally showing up for class and confusing your knowledge of world events (likely correct) with Baldwin's knowledge of world events (divorced from reality).

Definitely one of the best Art Hum teachers.  I registered for and then dropped two sections before lucking out on Andrew.  Very good lecturer, extremely nice, loves the subject matter, organized, clear, doesn't expect you to know everything about art (or indulge too much all of those people who like to spend five minutes generously sharing with the class how a painting makes them feel).  If you can get him, take him.  I went into Art Hum wary because of the many bad experiences people have with it, but I ended up loving the class, remembering what I learned, and really feeling that it was a valuable experiences.  In fact, if it hadn't been required I would have taken his class anyway in a heartbeat.  I have to say, for a core class that's pretty extraordinary.

He teaches a polemic, not an academic class, and abuses the position of teacher to rant at his students, offering little analysis grounded in anything resembling reality.  He won't engage in actual debate, instead changing the subject any time it looks like someone might pin down his having simply made things up.  He also barely mentions the CC books.  The syllabus might as well not have existed.  The fact that this man is allowed to teach at the university is a disgrace and tarnishes its academic integrity.  The problem isn't that I disagree with his views; the problem is that he seems to think he can just state them as facts, and anyone who disagrees is either stupid or part of some grand conspiracy.
By the way, he's Jordanian, not Palestinian.

I'm not sure which Justine the other reviewer from this class had, but she's fabulous.  Very very smart, extremely knowledgeable, very available, willing to tell you what is actually going on.

So. Many. Slides.  A ludicrous amount.  The stacks of notecards that we all carried around were sky-high.  And no mercy, either - we had to memorize all the nit-picky information, including the present location of each painting.  So if a Caravaggio is now housed in Phoenix, Arizona, we had to know that.

Hands down the best class I've had at Columbia.  Professor Friedman is an excellent professor.  He knows his stuff and challenges everyone to think.  The subject matter is extremely interesting and the class is conducted as a discussion.  The discussion format creates a great environment for learning, and if you do not know the material, it becomes apparent.  I have learned an immense amount in this class due to the power of the material and the way in which it is presented.

I tend to agree with most of the other reviewers. Zelin is pompous, arrogant, and quite self-important. I have no doubt that she would assign exclusively class readings that she had authored if it werenÂ’t so out of line; still, exhausted references to her The MagestrateÂ’s Tael can be expected. Her dry lecturing style can be come a little irksome as well, although it would be hard to say that her discussion sections didnÂ’t sometimes develop into quite disciplined and interesting reflections on Qing history. ItÂ’s funny because I get a sort of misguided maternal vibe from her, as if sheÂ’s trying to care about her students (but they keep making it so DAMN hard).

Vincent Aurora is a phenom. It almost feels redundant to lay more praise on the man when every other reviewer has done it, but, I really feel I must. I would declare, without hesitation, that he is the best professor on campus. He adores his job, is always prepared (almost to the point of anal retention), is the most approachable and responsive professor I've ever had a class with, and had the entire class pissing themselves with laughter biweekly. He's not just hugely entertaining and enthusiastic, though. Vincent is clearly an expert in his field (and wants to inspire such scholarship in his students) AND nearly every class he would drop a new bomb of brilliance on the class (throwing in tidbits of his intimate knowledge of at least four languages other than french and english AND he would throw in a latin lesson every once in a while just for kicks).

While I love Professor Spiegel to death, and think the material might actually be interesting if I had the time to read the books and watch the films, this class is utterly pointless. Considering your grade is based on the 20-pg thesis you hand in at the end of the semester -- which doesn't have to include any of the material on the syllabus or about any of the themes on the syllabus -- heck, it doesn't even have to be a formal essay; she'll accept creative works, as well! -- there's no reason, no motivation to do any of the work in class. The result is a weekly two-hour waste of time where Professor Spiegel bubbles enthusiastically about whatever we were supposed to be discussing that week but, because no one does the work, very little discussion is stimulated. I blame the English department for allowing such a course  -- either require term papers on the material we looked at in class, or don't require seminars at all and allow students to turn in some sort of scholarly work at the end of the semester that they wish.

Basically for all those willing to exert a considerable amount of time and effort, the class will be immensely rewarding.

What can I say?  If you're looking at a Culpa rating for a phys-ed instructor, you probably have a lot of time on your hands.  That said, let me say that Coach Cav is probably the best instructor you can have.
He's consistent because he always wears the same shorts with a dumbell on them and the same long-sleeved t-shirt which reads ""ROAR.""
He's complex.  If you manage to get into an intellectual conversation with Coach, he'll impress you with his vast knowledge of Vietnam and the mating patterns of various birds.
He's committed.  Coach always makes it out to gym class, rain or shine.  It's a tough job, but hell, someone's got to do it.

Professor Ghezzo is amazing. AMAZING. She was easily the best professor I had either semester, and this class was without a doubt my favorite. Despite the fact that it was from 6-8pm tuesday/thursday, I was (almost) always exicted to go to class and always left with a smile on my face. She is funny, very passionate about the works and knows an amazing amount. She makes the books interesting and I always felt bad if I hadn't done the reading as I couldn't fully appreciate what she and the rest of the class had to say about the texts. I had never, ever, taken a literature class before lit hum, and I am now seriously considering majoring in either english or comp lit. This class has opened my eyes to a whole other side of literature that I never knew before. I will be honestly very sad when this class is over.

I thought her to be a very fair grader, although you will have to work hard to get above an A-(by the same token, I think it's fairly hard to get below a B+). Write a good introduction to your papers, trust me. Paper topics are usually pretty wide and you can pretty much take them in any direction you want.

Prof. Jacquet is a very nice man who goes out of his way to answer questions in class. His lectures are straightforward, and always add insight not available from our textbook.  He is very organized, and we are well prepared for the tests.  He is very approachable after class if you have questions.  His French accent is funny but does not make him impossible to understand.  
It looks like these other reviews were written by bitter students who did not do well in the class. You do need to do the homework, read the book and study if you want an A. But this is the Ivy League.   The professor now goes to great lengths to stand away from the board after he is finished writing so that everyone can take notes.

The homework is often harder than the tests but this is a good balance - people who want to learn more can but those who have trouble with math won't fail if they do the work and come to class.

I have to admit, after taking theater and society with Denny, I became very apprehensive about my career as an actor and my success in the Barnard theater department.  She is a bit intimidating, but I soon learned after taking a smaller sized course with her, that her dominating presence is only due to the fact that she knows so much about what she does.  SHE IS AN AMAZING PROFESSOR.  I suggest to anyone who wishes to become a theater major, an actor, or even just wants to learn more about life in general--TAKE A CLASS WITH DENNY PARTRIDGE.  She knows what she's talking about.  She is a very intelligent and experienced woman, and while it is true that she tends to talk a lot about herself, it's ok because she is so interesting.  Even if you're not interested in theater and just need to fulfill a requirement or wish to take a class different from what you're used to, take one with Denny.   But beware: Denny believes everyone has the capability to become an amazing actor.  She pushes everyone really hard because she just assumes that everyone has it in them (which is a great feeling for a shy theater hopeful who doesn't expect to be taken seriously).  But if you're someone who expects to just breeze through her class without working, don't take a class with Denny.  She expects a lot from you and won't take any laziness. And watch out--her enthusiasm is contagious.  She has a passion for theater and life and social awareness that makes anyone who is in contact with her want to run out and do political theater--theater for a social purpose.  She really makes you think.
To those students who took theater and society with her as a first-semester freshman and are now turned off (or perhaps just scared???) of theater and acting, especially if that was your passion before college, DON'T AVOID HER!  TAKE MORE CLASSES WITH HER!  You will see that she deals much better with smaller classes and she is by far the best theater professor I have come into contact with so far.  You can learn so much from her.
She is easily accessible and ready to listen to concerns you might have.  Just be warned: she can be a tough critic but if you want a career in this field, that's what you have to learn to deal with, so get used to it.  Besides, her criticisms are always valid.
My conclusion?  DENNY PARTRIDGE IS ABSOLUTELY A FANTASTIC PROFESSOR!!!!!

First and foremost, it should be understood that sometimes , Prof's are forced to teach classes they may not like simply because there is no one else around to do it. They sepcialize in certain areas and they will work the best when they are teaching things they like the most.  This might have been the case with some of the other classes this man has taught but as for this class I would have to say it was by far the BEST history class I have ever taken at this school. This man nows his stuff when it comes to historical research and public health. I felt overall his enthusiasm was spectacular.  The class was incredibly thought provoking, he does not dictate the class to force you to think a certain way unlike some other professors. I guess because this was a seminar it might have been different but he wants the students to run the class and learn from eachother through active participation. Grant it he is hard to reach through email, but has flexible office hours and  is always willing to meet with you and help you with the paper.

The woman is totally crazy.  Avoid like the plague.  She is totally inappropriate in class, which she runs like a gulag.  Be ready for seventh grade remedial grammar lessons (no joke) that go on for hours.  Do you remember how to use a semi-colon?  Well, you'll learn.
You'll also ""unlearn"" all the writing instruction you've ever had in the past, as Bowstead claims that undergraduate and graduate schools (Columbia included, apparently) ""corrupt"" their students' writing abilities by rewarding erudition and jargon.  She wanted our master's level thesis to be aimed at a target audience of  ""bright 8 year old children.""  WTF!?!  I did not just pay $40K to be able to talk to an 8 year old. 
She's nuts--examples of which abound.  She'll go on and on about whatever random topic hits her brain--usually something either grammar related or totally unrelated to ANYTHING students were working on.  Loves to talk about her adoration for WordPerfect and hatred of MS Word, just based on the grammar functions!  (Sensing a pattern here...?)
You will find yourself constantly staring at the clock, rolling your eyes, and hopefully, talking back to her at some point.  After all, it's not like she has any control over your grade, which she informs you time and again.  But you do still have to go to class, so that she can see the ""body"" of your thesis--apparently the intro, background research, and discussion are no longer considered ""body"" parts of an essay.

He's super lenient with his attendance policy which can be frustrating in a class that is based around workshopping.

As a student who a) has taken Calculus before (7 years ago so you can all guess how much I remember) and b) enjoys rhetoric and ""unconventional"" teaching methods, I guess I can presume, based on many of the other reviews, that my assessments of Eric's class are going to be viewed as biased.  So be it.  I think that Eric's class is phenomenal.  I have taken many math, econ, science classes before and found myself both uninterested in the material and bored with the teacher's style.  Eric actually makes math interesting for me.   Yes Eric does assign a lot of homework, but I've found that I'm actually learning the material better than I have in most math classes I've taken before.  I'm not sure if I can attribute that to the workload or his teaching style or a combination of the two.  My suggestion to anyone looking to take a class with Eric is a) be prepared for a heavy workload...it's tough but it's worth it. b) if you are looking for a teacher to sit in front of the class and recite the book to you than you should look elsewhere.  c)  if you have questions or problems with the material, raise your hand in class or go to office hours.  In my experience he is always available to help.  I've noticed that in a lot of the reviews people have complained that Eric bases the class on a select few people who have ""taken Calculus before"".  This may happen from time to time, but, to his credit, I have very very rarely seen anyone raise their hand or ask a question in class when they have a problem.  He asks the class repeatedly if they are following the material, and quite often he is just met with silence.  Generally, the only people who do respond are the ones who have ""taken Calculus before"".  I think if you are willing to ask questions when you are confused and willing to accept a less conventional teaching method than Eric SImring is the best teacher I can recommend.

Avoid this man at all costs.  The Religion department changes the prof. on this class every semester, so do yourself a favor and wait a semester or even a year to take this with anyone else.  Schorsch assigns books he seems to not have read, and doesn't check into the price of the books when he is assigning them.  Had I not bought over half my books used from Amazon, I would have had to spend over twice as much on this class as I did on any other.  While the readings are occasionally interesting, they are completely disconnected and useless.  The class itself, in fact, has no coherent theme, the lectures are mostly summaries of the books with some discussion, and the essays are completely superfluous.  The only thing that made this class bearable for me was a good TA, who admitted to me that she couldn't find any organization or theme to the course either, and that she and the other TA's had to talk Schorsch out of giving us a final.  In her words, ""what did he think he was going to test you on?""  Schorsch is new in the religion department, he's actually a historian, and in my opinion he had no business teaching a class on Religions and the Modern World.

Prof. Belhumeur is totally chill, but definitely here to do research and not to teach. He came to Columbia from Yale a couple of years ago, and yet he still doesn't know how the credit system here works. He's invariably 5 to 10 minutes late, and he has missed 3 or 4 classes.
He did a few useful grounding lectures in the beginning, and then mostly took a back-seat role, letting students present and commenting occasionally.

I think this is one of the better (maybe best) pre-professional courses, but it might be slightly more work than others. Professor Mauel is super-enthusiastic about everything which helps in a what could be a painful experience. The course is devoted to doing physics with Mathematica, which enables you to solve problems with difficult math without knowing it. But you have to use a computer...which introduces its own problems. However, whenever you are having trouble, you can e-mail the professor and he will help you. The class was a pretty rewarding experience for me, but I can see how it might frustrate others. The strength of the course is that Professor Mauel encourages students to do their own ""research"" projects, but provides all of the tools necessary so that you can do something unique on your own without being too hard or time consuming.
Workload:
Weekly assignments, which shouldn't take more than an hour or two at the most (if it is taking you that long you should ask for help) and four research projects which Professor Mauel gives ideas to investigate and sets up any computer tools you'll need in class.

Moerman is the Man. I took this class to fulfill my Major Cultures requirement, and it was most fulfilling. Moerman is great at leading discussions, at asking good questions, at keeping the pace going, at making almost any text complex and interesting. Mind you, my section was particularly engaged and intelligent, so no promises if you have a class of dullards. I knew very little about Eastern philosophy and literature and had never studied it formally; I now want to take some more electives because of Moerman. The weekly online postings were at first a little annoying, but in the end, they made discussions so much better and the class much more structured. Plus, Moerman is so warm-hearted that I needed extensions on them for a week or so and he was very understanding. He's witty, interested, and interesting.

I liked the freedom of this class: there are no set assignments, only the occasional suggestion (e.g. ""try a sestina!""), which you're free to ignore or take as you will.

Although she gives a strong positive first impression, Naomi Weinberger should be avoided if it all possible.   She was a poor choice to teach this course, as she knew nothing about the majority of countries we studied (this is not an exaggeration, she freely admitted it).  Which begs the question, why go to class when the professor begins by telling you that her knowledge is limited to the weekly readings? She taught the course in a manner that presented each government and nation (other than Israel) as corrupt and backwards.  However, she managed to convey this message subtly enough to keep students from being aware of her agenda.  Furthermore, many of our readings were essentially glorified propaganda pieces.  This is a very dangerous way to teach a class, especially one as topical as Middle Eastern politics.
Finally, she's extremely unfriendly and inaccessible outside of the classroom.  She often ignores emails and refuses to make time to meet with students.  If you want a recommendation from her, ask as far in advance as possible as this woman is truly the kind who will never do a favor for anyone.  For the record, I received an A- in the class and was well liked by Weinberger, so my gripes with her aren't based on any kind of personal bitterness.  I was appalled by the way she treated many of my classmates, however, and by her unbelievably biased teaching style.

Anjana-ji is very friendly and approachable, and she cares a lot about her students... she is constantly arranging special activities and trips, cooking homemade indian food, and spends considerable amounts of time imparting advice and general life lessons.   She is a very entertaining, funny, sweet woman, who misses no opportunity to burst into song... class is never boring with anjana-ji.  However, you also don't learn very much.  Her handwriting is practically illegible, and her english poor enough to cause considerable communication problems (eg she NEVER understands the questions people ask her in class).  Very little emphasis is put on speaking, so don't expect to be able to carry on even the most basic conversation unless you have previous exposure to the language.
Which brings us to the final point-- Anjana-ji definitely gears the course towards the students of South Asian descent.  This can be a real problem in many ways, but most significantly, it segregates the class.  Non-indians end up feeling very isolated, marginalized, and unwelcome.  Although I have great affection for Anjana-ji, I would have to recommend that students wanting to learn Hindi enroll in one of the other sections.

Last week Professor Kaye gave one of his finest lectures of the semester, so it seems appropriate now to survey the course as a whole. Despite his mellifluous voice, which rarely (if ever) wavers from its soothing baritone, he is PASSIONATE about the subject, and especially about the medieval economy (which appears to be his specialty). He always writes out a list of key terms at the beginning of every lecture, which turn out to be quite useful when studying for the exams. He is excellent at relating different social, political, cultural, and economic institutions to one another, at a level that isn't daunting for the first-year but also won't bore older students or history majors; another mark of his desire to establish a comfortable, communal class atmosphere is the 7-10 minutes he always leaves at the end of class for questions. Call it pandering to the firstr-years if you will, but I definitely appreciated it. That said, there is a strong anti-Bush sentiment that tends to come out when Prof. Kaye attempts to connect events and trends of the Middle Ages to current events and trends, and he's quite successful at both (to the point of heavy-handedness). Overall, though, I'm leaving this class with an even more profound admiration for the Middle Ages, and for this class that introduced me to them.

I really think that they added the extra 35 minutes because Amir cant teach.  avoid him at all costs.  trust me you dont want to listen to him for this long.

Monica won't stand for your BS or your excuses, and it is for this and many other reasons that she is a wonderful instructor. She'll make you work hard. She won't dole out undue praise. But, she will sit down and talk with you about your writing, give you honest input, and always push you to produce something better than you thought was possible. She doesn't regard A's as her first born child; it's just that you actually have to earn them. And while to some, all this might make her sound like a drill sargeant, she actually has a sharp wit and friendly disposition.
She tends to choose politically charged material for the readings. If you don't agree with it, don't be afraid to share your opinion. She's not going to penalize you--but she will ask you to provide the same evidence for your argument that she requires of everyone else.

This is an excellent class that covers a lot of material: you will start with toy models for a fifth-grader and end up reading original research papers in the field with full understanding.  However, the class requires either a mathematical backgroud that goes well beyong the official prerequisite, or a substantial amount of hard work. Many people in the class had neither of the two. 
Thus, when one is reading people's assessments of the course one should keep in mind that not all students in the class were really in a position to adequately assess prof. Ting's competency. I was one of the students who found problem sets relatively easy (I worked alone on all of them) and for all I can tell, prof. Ting is at the top of his game. Not once did he put me in position to reflect on his mastery of the course material and I normally don't need much to start suspecting that one is not fully competent.
In addition, he is a just an excellent instructor, again, if you you are sufficiently prepared for the class. If you know little math and hardly ever open the textbook he may be hard to comprehend. On the other hand, I personally had only one math class before (and I have taken quite a few math classes over the years) in which the lectures were at the same time so informative, so engaging and so easy to follow. Even the hardest of proofs were given with great clarity and precision.
The materail covered in class is very interesting and a must-know for every serious social scientist. Prof. Ting does a great job of integrating across various models and tying it up with actual research questions in political science.

depends on the background. 6 problem sets (40%), mostly based on relatively easy examples in the textbook; an average problem set took me about 6-7 hours. a midterm (20%) and a final (40%). in addition, i spent about 20-30 hours reading the two textbook and practicing problems unrelated to the problem sets.

I had Prof. Sacks for Myth and Literature, and it was an extremely informative and engaging class.  Ancient epic poems (Greek, Roman, Norse, and Celtic) are apparently Prof. Sacks' thing, and he has a frightening, frightening amount of knowledge about  them.  From what I gathered over the course of the class, he understands ancient Greek, Latin, Anglo-Saxon, French, possibly German, and Celtic (both Welsh and Irish varieties).  His analyses of the texts are thus extremely, extremely, detailed.  He works as much as possible with the original language of the epics (though the class reads translations), and his lectures are crammed full of extremely elegant linguistic/thematic connections that are really just fantastic.  It's almost impossible not to learn something new every class.
So, as far as lectures go, this guy's great, assuming you have some kind of rudimentary interest in learning about ancient mythic systems.  However, his grading's on the hard side (especially considering few students in the class have the tools or ability to analyze the texts as deeply as he does).  Be warned.
Also, it's worth commenting that in my year, there were three different possible grading tracks -- one involving just the final and the midterm, and two others involving either three 3-page analyses or a 10-page final paper.  This flexibility was, for me at least, really convenient and helpful, especially considering the difficulty of getting a handle on the texts.  However, it can lead to certain administrative complications that may prove irritating to some.

The other two reviews are right on. Professor Leach is a MAGNIFICENT professor. At first he seems a bit brusque, a perhaps even unfeeling and intimidating for some students. But never fear - he really has a soft side, and he cares immensely about his students.
The diverse range of readings also made this seminar a joy. Totally unlike any other class you will take at Columbia. We talked about an immense variety of subjects - hunting, suburbia, plastic surgery, highways, everything. Leach is passionate and not afraid to share his opinions - but they're not always what you expect, and he wants you to challenge him and others in the class. There was definitely not a dominant attitude or doctrine in the class - everyone was free to express their various opinions.
The class is  not a joke - Leach takes the course very seriously - but it's also lots of fun.

fair, especially for a seminar. 100-200 pp of reading a week, but never very dense and a great variety. each week you wrote a 1-2 pp paper on some aspect of the reading. also one presentation (~5 minutes in length), and a term paper of 10-15 pp. that does not require (in fact, he discourages) research outside of what we have already read in the seminar (VERY generous for a seminar).

Maybe the negative review from below resulted from an experience early in Chad's teaching career. I really enjoyed his class. He is incredibly intelligent but also very laid back and makes jokes at himself all the time which puts you at ease. I was afraid he was going to assign a lot of texts and grade harshly but honestly the readings were 5 minutes at best per night and his grading is very fair, I daresay lenient.  I am really terrible at music, but it didn't really hurt my grade or understanding. If you are interested in another aspect of music - philosophy, mainly - then he puts plenty of historical and philosophical background in his lectures to keep you interested. Take notes and you will be fine on the quizzes that he warns you about the day before he gives them. He's just simply in love with music and the knowledge surrounding music. He is comfortable talking about every era, can answer most questions sufficiently and gets excited about it. He's also an incredibly nice person, which is a good contrast with the amount of organization and preparation he puts into the class. Seriously, Chad was the only person in the room who I would want to hang out with outside of class.

Helzner is a very knowledgeable, smart professor.  He enjoys the socratic style of teaching - sitting in a chair posing questions and poking holes in answers.  That's a great technique but he doesn't often go beyond it and present lecture material to supplement the questioning.  That means you won't often have a comprehensive treatment of a concept or material in class, which you may or may not prefer.  
He is a brilliant professor who respects answers and students.  His give and take in class is always generous and enjoyable.  His math background makes him vulnerable to describing everything in math terms and symbols.

Clearly brilliant and highly, highly educated.  Excellent approach to advanced spanish that focuses on rules rather than feel.  She is available for out-of-class help and varies her class meetings to avoid boredom.
She has a high standard for students and expects you to work at the material.  However, if you try and see her during office hours she'll be more lenient.
She has a tendency to be a little caustic in her responses to students, usually when students ask questions about material they should already know.

Professor Cross clearly knows Kierkegaard and his lectures are complete, detailed, and full of thematic understanding.  He gives good introductions and then plows into the texts to find out exactly where things are stated and presented.
His biggest problem is that he cannot schedule his lectures appropriately.  He spent far too much time on one text (2/3 of the semester) and ended up boring the whole class to death before moving on.  He needs to focus on a few main points (very difficult in Kierkegaard yes, but not impossible) and follow a syllabus (no, he didn't give us one).  
Also, he was extremely tardy returning midterm essays.  He didn't return them until the final class of the semester, which of course is too late to pass/fail or drop a class.

This course serves its purpose as a pre-professional course: it tells you the truth that Coumbia's applied math curriculum is all about physics. The course covers 4 physics topics: astrophysics, statistical physics, Fourier transformation applied on physics problems and quantum mechanics. If you're a physics guru, this class is certainly for you. Otherwise, you should really consider taking another pre-professional course.
Anyway, Professor Mauel is the most enthusiastic and friendly teacher I've seen in Columbia. One can easily tell that he's genuinely interested in what he's lecturing: will you jump and exclaim in delight when you talk about Kepler's laws? I won't, you probably will not, but Professor Mauel will.  He's also friendly and he doesn't mind giving you personal, step by step tutorials on how to complete your assignments. You can e-mail him your mathematica programming codes, (Oh, this class is all about mathematica and programming, if you don't know C++/ Java, you'll be in a great disadvantage)  tell him your problem, and he'll tell you his suggested programming codes usually within 24 hours.

I cannot say enough good things about Prof. Blackmar.  In every lecture I was completely riveted.  She packs a ton of information into the first 15-20 minutes of lectures and then illustrates her points using slides, so you can actually see the trends in the built environment that she's talking about.  You can tell that she's passionate about cultural geography and landscape history.  She is also an extremely kind professor who really tries to get to know all her students, and although this isn't easy in a class of 100, if you go to her office hours she'll never forget you and you'll learn a lot as well.

Yes, the problem sets and the tests are challenging.  You will actually have to work, not just to figure out the answers, but to figure out how to figure out the answers.  This can be intimindating and frustrating.  But it also ensures that you understand what you're doing, rather than just regurgitating information or plugging numbers into information with all the comprehension of their meaning that your calculator has.  And for gods' sake, there are only 5 problem sets for the entire semester, one of which is optional!  In a class for which there is no reading or other homework, spending a few hours on a problem set 4 or 5 times a semester is an astonishingly small workload.  The quizzes cover the exact same material as the problem sets and are open-notes, as are the midterm and final.  And they're all curved.  How can this be ""unfair""?
Frankly, I found the work in this class to be intimidating and my grade was not as good, or as easy, as I would have liked.  But not for a moment would I criticize the course or professor for that.  In fact, I skirted the A-/B+ border without putting in that much time, doing problem sets in a group, attending office hours to get help, or having done virtually any math in my last four years of studying history.  This is a challenging class, certainly, but its demands are neither unmanageable nor excessive.
And in fact, the class is highly enjoyable.  Professor Helfand--once a theater major--is a highly entertaining speaker--vivacious, passionate, and funny.  He'll do anything to draw his students in, get them interested, or flip on their mental lights.  His stunts--like running a gambling scam to prove how much better statistics are than luck or superstition, or charging full-body into a locked door to show... well, something about physics--are legendary.  And he does convey his subject matter.  His lectures are not just entertaining; they're very well-organized and convey a lot of information very well.  It's also pretty easy to tell which data he's telling us just for the sake of curiosity or enlightenment, and which are necessary for a grade.  Professor Helfand is the kind of instructor who gets an ovation at the end of the semester, and deserves every bit of it.
About the material: it covers everything, or tries to.  One of Helfand's main goals is to convey how relevant science and scientific thinking are to every aspect of our lives, and for me, at least, it's changed the way I look at the world and at knowledge.  The beginning of the first semester is somewhat dry, because the course has no prereqs other than algebra and he has to cover, as quickly as possible, some rudiments of chemistry and physics (and later, probablility and statistics.)  Then it gets interesting as he applies these concepts to questions as diverse as global warming, the authenticity of the shroud of Turin, radiation at Hiroshima, what killed the dinosaurs, supernovae, the diets of prehistoric man, and the origin of the universe.  He teaches as much about how scientists know what they know as about what they know, which is really valuable, and which I didn't expect as much of in an intro class.  If you get bored with any topic he addresses, or find it too confusing, never fear, because he'll be somewhere else soon.

I have to say that I find these other reviews a mystery.  I found Rebecca to be mean, snide, and extremely confusing.  Her lectures were rambling, and she had seemingly know idea how to ask her students questions that would either provoke their thought or guide them in any useful direction.  Her comments on papers were petty, and did little to point the student toward a better understanding of how to write about art.  I finally dropped the class in frustration after realizing that despite taking meticulous class notes, I had literally no idea what would be on the midterm, or how to study, simply because Rebecca was so vague.

This class was interesting, in good and bad ways.  I took it simply because I wanted to take a class with a Nobel Laureate, and I appreciated that in the end.  There is not much structure to this course - it is basically the 'topics' that Mundell has published important papers on during his career, and so there is no main textbook.  I was blown away by Mundell's incredibly sophisticated papers, even though most of his very important work he accomplished during the early 60's.  Nevertheless, Mundell does a great job of keeping subjects topical to today.
That said, Mundell is a couple parts crazy.  In the '80s and since he has become an advocate of supply side economics, and he becomes much more of an ideologue than an economist while discussing it.  Also, his articles often diverged from what was being discussed in class, and it the syllabus was pretty incoherent.
I would not recommend this class to any besides an econ major, and probably no one besides a senior who has taken a  large number of classes, especially in international econ.

There is an understated grace to the method with which Michael Rosenthal conducts a class. Several themes surface as you go on throughout the year: he will say ""I am a simple man,"" ""I am skeptical of that,"" ""I urge you to take yourselves seriously."" He is simple; he expects only that you read and come to class ready to discuss, and the questions he raises are pointed, direct, and always relevant: ""what is the function of this?"" or ""what did you think of this?"" He is skeptical; you will not delve into postmodern literary theory, or long tangents into etymology, or reductive biographies and historical currents, or intuitively nonsense ideas, or ""things that professors say."" He is serious; every work is treated as if it were somehow relevant to a life-or-death condition of humanity, everybody will participate or eventually be called upon, every comment will be considered with academic rigor even if it is a flailing gasp at coherency, and every class creates an atmosphere where students are naturally compelled to invest in it as such.
There are downsides. He will claim to be open to varying interpretations, but not always (although if you disagree initially, you are usually persuaded to his reading anyway). He will ask questions until he arrives at something close to his right answer, and then expostulate on his reading for what seems like a bit too long sometimes. He will not take you to King Lear even when you can get discount tickets to an award-winning interpretation.
And yet, professors like him are why I came to Columbia; his Lit Hum made me an English major. He is brilliant, unassuming, unintimidating, highly approachable, incredibly kind, old-school almost--but not quite--to a fault. He conveys just the right ratio of ego to that which backs it up, tempered with self-effacing humor and dry English-professor--but not smug Ivy League academic--wit. The man embodies all that the Core is meant to give you with Lit Hum, a class that--as head of the English department--he elects to teach out of his passion for the humanities and his ""perfect goodness to you."" And, as you realize every time that a writer discusses the purpose of art, his teaching--every text, Homer to Woolf (his specialty)--is artistic, gently shaping, blending, and combining ideas to moments of radiance and insight. If you get him, and you are even mildly engaged in a liberal arts education, you are blessed. He will make you into a better reader and a more passionate student.

Despite the fact that the syllabus includes some of the greatest literature ever written, this class is a total waste of time.  Stewart hardly lectures at all, and instead reads long passages aloud and then asks the class ""So what do you make of that?""  The rest of the time is filled with generally pointless and random comments from the peanut gallery, which is usually dominated by a single student.  Stewart generally didn't build off the comments at all, so the class just degenerated into a free-for-all and no one learned anything about the plays.  And man, were there ever a lot of old people taking up space in an overcrowded classroom.  Despite some attempts to structure things more (handouts, themed discussions), no real order or substance ever evolved.  The only highlight was a hand-out featuring Renaissance translations of classical texts dealing with man-boy love ( ""The only true love is that of younge boies.."")

The O'Flaherty bashing has gotten ridiculous. All the complaining done by the past reviewers seems effected by the notion that the intro Econ course should be easy. I hear kids who didn't do the problem sets, didn't go to lecture, and didn't go to recitation complain that O'Flaherty did a crappy job. That's just bullshit. The book and recitations taught the course. O'Flaherty offered his own interesting insights and real-life examples on the current topics taught in the weekly reading. Of course, he assumed that kids had actually done the reading and thus didn't teach the fundamentals the book went over. Indeed, if you hadn't done the reading you didn't have a clue what was going on in lecture. In other words, if you keep up with the work you will do fine in the class and get a decent introductory understanding of economics.

Geoff is truly the best instructor I have had at Columbia thus far.  He made our class discussions engaging and challenging, and he was always able to provide some interesting commentary about the current text.  Geoff also made an extra effort to supply our class with a lot of additional materials that were relevant to the texts.  He was always on time and always prepared, even if several of his students were not.  He never picked on anyone or called them out for an on-the-spot analysis.  Rather, he instead presented the class with thought provoking questions that made everyone want to respond and join in the discussion.  Despite his own opinions about the meaning of the different texts, Geoff listened to everyone's interpretations and never made anyone feel stupid.  He is also ALWAYS avaliable to talk about papers, difficulties, etc., even outside of his allotted office hours.  He is kind and supportive and really cares about his students.  I feel like I learned so much in his class, and I feel very lucky that I had the opportunity to take Lit Hum with Geoff.

Tiffany is a great instructor.  Although a lot of students think University Writing is a pain in the neck, getting through it with Ms. Alkan is OK.  She is a very fair grader, and I really feel like I learned a lot about my personal writing style and bad habits, and how to improve them.  Ms. Alkan always made time to be available to talk about papers and concerns, and I found this to be extremely beneficial, especially for re-drafting papers.  She can be picky on the first drafts, but after getting over your ego and realizing that your paper really DOES need some work, incorporating her comments really do make a better paper, and you will be a better and more conscientious writer for it.

Colin is a successful novelist and book editor who has helped at least one GS writing student get published. You have to listen closely, because he doesn't say much, but he does offer excellent criticism to students he thinks are worthy. But don't be fooled by his humor and apparently casual attitude. He's merciless toward students who are not professional material. And he'll tell you so, but not until the last class.

He definitely cares a lot about students and his teaching, and seems frustrated that he's not a better teacher, but I really had no complaints.

I completely agree with the previous review. Monica in my opinion, is a truly brillant professor. First, she is not bias - if you do not agree with her opinion, just substantiate it with evidence. She will not hold it against you for 'disagreeing' with her. Second, she is patient and willing to help you out with your writing, provided you are serious at all about it. I have found myself improving immensely throughout this semester. She will make every effort to go out of her way to offer pointers on how you can further improve on your writing skills. She is the type of professor that will teach you how to learn - a trait I have realized that only a dozen or so professors possess. An A in this class is not esay (but then, so is every UW class).

Each class was conducted exactly the same.  Individuals were required to present their weekly responses regarding the reading to the class.  They were then commented upon by Kitcher, other students... and then on to the next person.  The format became pretty stagnent early on. 
However, the weekly responses were an excellent way to be engaged in the reading.  
Kitcher himself is obviously extremely well read and in touch with the works in this course (Capital, Wealth of Nations, On Liberty, etc).  He related his views to the class in what was often an engaging and animated way.
However, Kitcher does have a tendency to downgrade opinions and interpretation that conflict with his own -- and he does not do so in a terribly accommodating manner.  Rather, you feel as though you cannot pursue your interpretation for fear of a bad grade.  This is not to say he that Kitcher is not a good professor.  Many professors, especially in the Philosophy department, suffer from this hang up.  As an individual, Kitcher is extremely approachable and human (I say this, because I sometimes doubt the humanity of professors -- often out of touch with everything but their field of study)

Stephen Massimilla is a wonderful teacher. His enthusiasm for all the works is contagious. His teaching style varies from day to day and from work to work. Sometimes the classes were mostly lectures and sometimes mostly class discussion. It was the little things that Massimilla did that made his class such a rip-roarin' good time. One day, we turned off the lights in the class and chanted certain passages from Greek plays- it sounds silly, but it really worked to get you to look at them from another angle. Another day, we had males acting as females talking about sex (Lysistrata). He speaks fluent Italian, which makes Dante sound beautiful. Not only is he able to place the work in context of when it was written, but Massimilla also makes each of the works relevant to present day. Attending Mass was always an experience. One never knew what sort of interesting, albeit sometimes bizarre, analogy he'll make to ensure that the work connects with the average freshman. His depth and breadth of knowledge was also impressive. He seemed to not only have command over every work on the syllabus, but he also related the works to art and philosophy.

I disagree completely with all the negative reviews posted on here about Thurman.  Thurman is indeed an incredibly smart thinker and highly intelligent--the only thing the prior reviewers have gotten right about him, in my opinion.  Thurman definitely is not your typical stuffy Ivy League lecturer filled with mundane academia crap.  If you're expecting to be given a boring textbook lecture, then of course you're going to be disappointed.  I, for one, absolutely LOVED going to his classes; it was the highlight of my week.  Thurman challenged one to think outside the box, reject unquestionably accepting the mores of established society, and really lay off the pretentiousness and act realistic.  Don't expect to get anything out of his class if you're planning on approaching it with the same systematic mentality you approach the majority of other CU classes. Thurman's class is truly the only challenging course I've taken here at Columbia (I'm a 3rd year). ...

I cannot begin to express how dissapointed I am with the classes I took with Prof. Bellati. Disorganized, unhelpful, and obnoxious are just a few of the words that come to mind when thinking of this class. Every student I spoke with agreed that it was a living hell four times a week, and none of us got anything out of it. He grades too nicely at times to compensate for the fact that he doesn't teach, and even though I got an A-, there were several kids in the class that did not do well at all. I was actually warned against taking Prof.Bellati and I took his class becasue nothing else fit into my schedule. What a mistake.

It's impossible to overemphasize the importance of taking this course with someone else. While theoretically every section of University Writing should be more or less interchangable, Ms. Wallack manages to make sure that her section always has more work to do than any of the others. In addition to assigning more work, she tends not to be too specific about exactly what she's looking for, and never returned assignments quickly enough for the next one to reflect her comments. She also has no sense of time management in the classroom, often beginning what should be a 20 minute discussion with 5 minutes left in class.
While she's willing to be somewhat flexible on major deadlines to those who she thinks make the class a priority, there's no predicting whether or not those people are the ones who actually give a damn.

Let me preface this class with a warning. Be prepared for readings, and a lot of them. Coming into this class you should either have a substantial background in South Asian studies or the determination to teach a shitload of background information to yourself. There are ALOT of names and dates, and they come at lightning speed. Don't take this class if your interested in having a good professor, take this class if your REALLY interested in South Asia. I had no background in Indian History and I felt completely overwhelmed the entire semester. Even if I end up coming away with a good grade, it was not worth the mental anguish of being constantly lost.

I thought I had caught on to something special when I attended Dalton's first few lectures.  By the end of the semester, I regretted taking his class.  He's a passionate, extremely knowledgable professor, but spends more time railing against George Bush and the war in Iraq or extolling Mahatma Gandhi than actually teaching the course.  He's also an extremely picky grader; the previous reviews are right in saying that he expects you to recite the packet to him.  But not only that, you had better know every detail in the packet because he nickel-and-dimes you into much lower grades with small deductions for every missed minor detail on the exams.  And if you're a preprofessional student, don't expect him to be sympathetic to your need for good grades when grading your exams.  He grades everyone's exams extremely hard and spends signficant class time urging students to spend a few years working for Teach for America rather than attending medical or law school.  The bottom line: Dalton is great if you're a political liberal who is against all wars and doesn't care too much about grades.  If you don't have the aforementioned qualities, you probably should stay away from him.

While she is very sweet and has students from the class who are dancers demonstrate nearly every step, I would definitely have appreciated it more if I had any clue what I was talking about. 
      Professor Garafola really knows her stuff. She has been in the business for years, first as a dancer and then as a professor in its history.

He is also very understanding of slow students (like me).  I loved him so much I would take any class he was teaching.

Professor Stalnaker is absolutely amazing. Her class is such a pleasure to sit through and a breath of fresh air from all of my other classes to look forward to. I feel that the quality of a class relies only so much on its content and that having been said, I must say that Professor Stalnaker makes Lit Hum such a joy to take. She is a sweet, friendly, approachable teacher who does not talk down to her students and encourages interaction. Also, she always informed us of any outside activities pertaining to the subject matter and accompanied us as well, all with a smile.

When Yongyan stuck to the ""conversation"" part of the class, the discussions were engaging (this will probably depend on your classmates). We talked about affirmative action, religious freedom in France...though then the topics started deteriorating (we read about wedding photos than had to respond to Ms. He's questions: How will your wedding be?! Will it be on the beach?!...). I don't know why she then decided to incorporate a grammar lesson into her class sessions, splicing the time for conversation practice in half. As this class is not required for any major, I suspect most people were drawn to the possibility of enhancing their speaking skills. With everyone in the class at the third year level or above, it was insane for her to take thirty plus minutes to explain to us the most basic use of articles or the imperfect. For grammar improvement, Columbia has 3405. In fact, I think Yongyan was a little bitter about teaching such a useless classClearly, her bitterness has spread to me, but really, an A-...perhaps my conversation skills could have been A quality if I had been given greater opportunity to converse.

Aurora offers a burst of other-culturely charm. This class, you should also know, has a lot of work. On the first day, Dr. Aurora called us all masochists for enrolling. At first, it is manageable, even (I'm a nerd) enjoyable as you start to feel your French improving; but as your other teachers, too, start assigning papers and tests, you might start to resent 3405. Yet never the teacher.  If you are only able to half-ass some of the assignments and feel that you are retaining less, you can still pick up a lot of knowledge in class--all of his lessons are amazing and informative. You will hardly ever look at the clock because Aurora is the best teacher ever, combining the right amount of humor and pressure to get you engaged and working.  His excitement and perfect teaching style made my resentment towards the heavy workload disappear (Because there is nothing worse than an apathetic, unapproachable teacher who assigns too much homework ,seemingly on a whim). Aurora reads and grades every assignment right away, and offers copious amounts of comments on each. He's right there with the students at every step.

I'm SO surprised that a bunch of  'economics' majors didn't enjoy Flaherty's class.  If all you're interested in is working for Goldman, don't read this review.
For those of you that actually are interested in economics, this class is interesting but with faults.  Urban economics is a discipline that's very different from most economic fields; it focuses on the economics of personal incentives, and attempts to build small scale models about interactions inside a city, such as traffic ongestion, land prices, crime, etc.  It's an intersting approach to a lot of topics that you will not find anywhere else, and a break from highly developed models in other courses, like macro.  
Flaherty himself is entertaining, but can often descend into trivialities that make lectures semi-painful.  The textbook is horribly unconcise, written by Flaherty himself, and he needs to learn how to consolidate his thoughts. But his openness creates genuine class discussion even in a lecture, and at no point does he attempt to declare orthodoxy or force truths onto you.
If you have even a mild amount of intellectual curiosity, you will enjoy this and it's not a difficult course.

Prof Reed is an excellent teacher.  He is well prepared for class and knows his material very well.  He is especially helpful during office hours.  His is not a hard professor to get a hold of because he constantly checks his e-mails (and replies to any questions one might have) and gives you his cell phone to call if necessary.  The course covers curves and surfaces.  He covers bezier and b-spline curves.  He also gives lots of examples in class and goes over it in detail.

I think that most of the mean reviews of Professor Mowshowitz come from people who didn't do as well as they expected to. If you're not ready to deal with a biology class that actually forces you to think instead of just regurgitating facts, this is definitely not for you.  You have to do a ton of work. The reason that Professor Mowshowitz doesn't use the established textbooks is that they throw so many details at you that the key concepts get overlooked. This is probably one of the few problem-based intro biology courses in the country, so all the materials and problems are from Dr. M herself. 
Here is the deal. If you want to actually understand the concepts and learn to apply them, then take the course. If you want a bio course where you memorize the ""established"" textbooks and get an A by regurgitating material, go elsewhere

Stay away. Norma is a sweet-enough lady, and adorable, but this class is painful and very difficult to do well in. Her lectures are dull (they lie somewhere in the realm of actual teaching and rambling, not quite either), and the only interesting things are the days when she shows videos. I dunno, at some point I just stopped going to class.
    The text book by Peter Gray is FASCINATING though. Very well written, and just amazingly interesting. That may have been the one highlight of the course.
     I became quite acquainted with the textbook when studying for her exams. Turned out to be a waste of time... her exams are IMPOSSIBLE. They ask you to remember such minor facts or random parts of lectures (which, admittedly, I just flat out stopped attending mid-way thru the semester). I don't regret it though. I received the same grade on the exam that I went to class for and studied minorly for than for the exam I stopped going to and studied extensively. I guess its however you want to deal with teh course. I guess I figured it would be an easy way to fulfill the science requirement. I was sadly mistaken. I hear its easier in the Fall. My suggestion would be to take it there.
    The largeness of the class also makes portions of it very time consuming, and I feel like a lot of the information could be better presented in a smaller class. Perhaps discussion sections.

Norma has this theory that since this is a 3-point class, you should spend 9 hours a week on work. You spend 3 of them in class, which leaves 6 hours of homework. Oh, and she's not joking.

This was probably my favorite class this semester. Pablo is, admittedly, not the most engaging lecturer, but I think he got much better as the semester went on. He is incredibly approachable, charming and obviously very passionate about the subject. He's also adorable - in the way that a puppy is. He does a very good job of covering the material (I found his powerpoint slides to be pretty comprehensive, contrary to what other people here have said). Covering 200 years of history for one and a half continents is not a task necessarily easily done. 
     The TA's (mine anyway) expected a lot from you, but were incredibly approachable and understanding about late work, etc. The readings varied in quality from ENTHRALLING to dry and unbearable, but they were a minor part of the class for me. Overall, this was my favorite class this semester, and I always found it a pleasure to go to class. I highly recommend it.

Mr. Pirouet is really nice and tries really hard, and I really want to give this guy a nice review but I can't.  I'll preface this by saying that I don't like philosophy and I am more of a math and science person.  However, the teaching more than the content of this class is what made it horrible.  Mr. Pirouet is incredibly intelligent but feels no need to explain his train of thought, nor make sure his students actually understood what they read before taking it to the next level.  His lectures have absolutely no structure and the two hour period is just one completely random tangent followed by another.

GENERAL COMMENTS
I've really been impressed by this class.  It's a very well taught course.  The lectures are clear (and funny at times) and well presented.  The course is well organized and well run overall.  It's really been excellent.  
Although this is a subtle point, I've been impressed with the pedagogical tone of both the instructor (Glenn Cowan) and the TAs.  It's a little hard to get at, but for instance it made an impression on me at one point when the grading process for the exams was being discussed, and the emphasis in grading was on understanding the concepts, and making minor math errors was not penalized.  I may not be explaining this well, but what this represents to me is a sincere desire to *assist* the students in learning and help us along, as opposed to just evaluating our performance.  Maybe my example does not seem to really illustrate this clearly at all, but anyway my point is that the impression that I have had as a student is of a very supportive learning environment, and this impression has come across in multiple interactions with the TAs and instructor.  
The instructor has been quite responsive to feedback & suggestions from students.  Also, he has been careful about preventing cheating on exams, which I think is important for fairness.  He and the TAÂ’s have been very professional about how they have handled themselves throughout the course.  In particular the instructor has struck a nice balance of being very serious about the running of the course and at the same time made the course material enjoyable and fairly entertaining.  
I think itÂ’s good that the course uses a textbook that isnÂ’t always coming out in new editions.  It makes it possible to save money by buying a used copy.  
ABOUT THE TA'S
I've been quite impressed by all the TAs uniformly for this class.  They have been very helpful in the labs; and have also expressed an *attitude* of wanting to be helpful, that this is what they want to do.  I'm speaking about both the grad TAs and the undergrad TAs.  I've also had some electrical engineering questions outside of the lab material, and in particular Nebojsa went out of his way to find information about this for me.  
In particular, both Nebojsa and Brett have been very available and forthcoming with help in the labs.  Jerry and sometimes Scott have also worked at my lab session, and have been quite good.  Ali was not the TA for my lab, so I can't comment about him.  
About the labs:  The equipment and materials that we have needed have always been available and in good condition.  I think this may be a sign that there is plentiful funding for equipment, but also I think that whoever has been in charge of organizing the equipment and supplies has done a really good job.  The additional information on the whiteboard during the labs has been helpful and sufficient.

Not only I see the whole class reaching depths of confusion, but what angers me the most is that I won't be ready for my other classes that follows this one.

Kevin Newman is young, easy on the eyes, and pretty damn smart, but he doesn't exactly impart a passion for the subject.  I'd be more suspicious of him if he did.  Columbia just cannot figure out how to develop a truly useful writing class.  
Kevin's  approach seems to be to dig around the week's pile, select the most comically pitiful student work, and tear into it (in his own delicate sort of way).  Complaints: He'll pretend to be interested in the most vapid comments and act like every essay--even the ones written 45 minutes before class--is a revision away from respectability.  Uh, no.  
Grading is standard, which is to say, merciless.  I pulled an A-, which makes me a bit more sympathetic.  You'll learn a few invisibly fine points of grammar (which I intend to lord over friends and family) and develop a tremendous aversion to inductive reasoning.  My essays did get better, mainly because I was scared out of my mind that my lot would be drawn.

I have never written a culpa review before but I feel that I must do so for posterity.  Yes, she must have some good ideas, but she does not take her role as a teacher seriously.  She discourages.  Blindly.  She does not approach students' work with an open mind or actually try to help if they have questions about her opinions or grading methods.  If your approach to film is not identical to her's (from a very academic, concrete perspective) she will not try to understand where you're coming from.  Instead of helping to teach you her way, she'll just compare you to other students in the class and hint that you'd never understand or be capable of performing up to that level anyway.  I really thought she was rude.  I'm sure that she used to be a better teacher, but she just made me feel bad about myself and my work for no reason.  If you want to take her class, just make sure that you think she's a genius and you totally understand her method and you'll do just fine.

I agree with the previous reviews, both about the strength of the Slavic Department TA's in general, and about Jon's excellence even among this elite group.  The third Grad Student instructor I've experienced in my Russian Language course history, John has been the best of the bunch.  He is an excellent teacher for all the reasons mentioned in the other reviews; he knows how to teach the language to non-native speakers, he prepares extensively for each lesson, knowing exactly what he wants to get accomplished...but most of all, he keeps the pace of the class moving; it's not so much that we're covering material at a faster rate, but rather, that we're covering the same material from a wide variety of alternating approaches, and through different sorts of excercises. As opposed to simply having us read through the examples in the no good, poorly organized text book, John brings in his own excercises, which are always much better, and always include a healthy dose of that peculiar slavicist irony that keeps the class moving.  Great teacher, I have no complaints at all.  Highly recommended.

Prof Cohen is a wonderful instructor.  The pace of the course was very consistent, examples from 'real music' distributed evenly throughout, and above all, Cohen was completely attuned to the individual and collective needs of the students in the class.  Regarding this point; it is a remarkable tribute to Cohen's abilitiy that this class was apparently able to please people at both ends of the spectrum of musical experience.  There were some who entered this class with quite a significant background in music, both in harmony and counterpoint, and others whose background was almost exclusively derived from the one semester-long; ""fundamentals"" course.  Obviously, putting these two types of students in a room (with a healthy chunk of us in between, of course), and trying to please everyone is going to be a challenge for any instructor.  But, Cohen handles it remarkably well.  The class, it seems, was neither too slow for the 'whiz kids,' who can derive significant joy, it seems, from asking and answering Cohen's questions, but neither was it too fast for the students with less formal training in music.  Cohen took time, throughout, on reviewing all sorts of musical base knowledge...'reminding' us patiently of what we should know already.  And, questions of the more basic variety were welcomed patiently as well as those that came from a more advanced understanding.
Some students might object to use of the adverb 'patiently' in the above.  But, to be honest, I happen to think these students (like one review posted) are totally wrong in their portrayal of Cohen as a grumpy guy who hates people who don't know about music.  The man is incredibly patient with his students.  He has a very deep appreciation for the importance of musical education at this entry level, and it comes through in how he approaches the class.  But, try to be on time to class.

The class went by mostly painlessly, and I aborbed the relevant details about what images are on the upper walls of the parthenon, the structural lines that Raphael was thinking about when he painted, and some biographical information about Goya, and in the end, I did pretty well in the course.  But, I left with a pretty bad taste in mouth.
  What it may come down to is a mere clash of personalities, but nonetheless, I thought I'd voice my opinion.  I found Creagh to be an unfriendly, arrogant, and overall, quite unpersonable as an instructor.  In a different setting, where the material itself is emphasized (ie, if we were meant to be learning ABOUT art, as opposed to learning about HOW to look at art) such arrogance and coldness would have gone by, for me, unnoticed, or at least would not have really changed my view on the course overall.
But, in a class like ARt Hum, where the level is neccesarily basic and introductory, where the 'correct' and sublimely interesting answers to questions posed in class are things like; ""because the columns go up and down,"" or, ""she's pointing up, to god,"" or ""his arm is longer than it should be"", in a class like this, personality, a sense of humor, and friendliness on the whole, seem like crucial elements. 
  Maybe it isn't fair to blame Creagh for her rudeness, and her generally frigid demeanor.  She may very well have no interest at all in being an educator.  She may hate teaching.  She may hate dealing with undergraduates who don't know art history, and who don't know why it's important to know.  Fair enough.
But, this is a culpa review.  So, I'm telling you;
It's not about unfair grading, or boring lectures, or unfamilarity with the material...

   Amen.  It's pretty hard to adequately describe how much he rules.   To begin, his knowledge is encyclopedic, but more importantly, he is able to read deeper into every word than anyone I've ever seen, and he sees exactly how the works speak to each other.  He doesn't put things in dummy terms, but he is able to dissolve the barriers that many of these texts present.  That is, he elucidates things exceptionally without dumbing them down. 
   His manner in the class is bright, excited about both the texts and student comments.  His own comments are of such value, however, that  people in the class didn't generally make statements just to be heard, but  instead pushed themselves and spoke when it was valuable.   On the midterm Prof. Stein told us to be ""as bold as we wish"" in our assertions; he inspires students to use every bit of their capacity.

The phrase ""deceptive android"" is a little severe for Farooq.  As a result, possibly, of his CULPA reviews (which he reads - hi Farooq!), he wasn't SO tough this semester - I know at least one person who got an A on every paper.  No easy class, however, is this.  If you'd like to do well, I'd recommend conferencing with him outside of class as much as possible.  It'll give you a better idea of exactly what he wants to see on your revisions.
Farooq is a really friendly and intelligent guy, and he knows how to get a good discussion going, but he sometimes has trouble backing up his ideas.  He often, for instance, told me in his comments on my papers that I should explain the ""whys"" and ""hows"" of my arguments in my revisions.  Fair enough.  When, however, I asked him ""Why should I provide those details?"" and ""How should I provide them?"", he was unable to come up with whys and hows of his own, so I was confused as to how I should proceed.  
To Farooq's credit, however, I've found myself thinking far more critically about my academic writing - for all of my classes - since the start of his course than I was before the semester started.  That's no small accomplishment on Farooq's part.  In addition, Farooq was always available to conference outside of class and just a sweet guy in general.

If you got Dr. Forcione for Lit Hum this year, thank your lucky stars.  This man is not just a Lit Hum instructor - he's a full professor and the Director of Undergraduate Studies for Spanish at Columbia.  If you Google him, you'll see that he's a Cervantes scholar who's written several books on Don Quixote, a fact that made our spring-semester discussion of that book particularly interesting.  He's absolutely brilliant, but more important, he cares about Lit Hum - I found myself interested in the class discussion even on days when I hadn't done the reading (and those days were numerous).
Dr. Forcione is just about the nicest guy ever, too.  He's the sort of archetypal college professor you see in books and movies...he might seem a little scatterbrained when you first meet him, but he's 100% focused during discussions.  He always had a student or two trailing after him to talk some more at the end of class.  All that and he's a very clement grader!
I suppose my only criticism of Dr. F is that his handwriting is sometimes kind of illegible.  The essay I got back today has a comment on it that looks like it says ""the amity is dar frog to the part.""  I have no clue what it's supposed to say, but nonetheless, I give this guy an A+...+!

Madeleine Dobie is a brilliant woman (Director of Undergraduate Studies for French!) with a wonderfully dry sense of humor and a very lulling Franco-British accent.  She picks a wide variety of interesting material for this course, but be forewarned, it's a LOT of reading, and you pretty much need to do all of it before the midterm and final.  Professor Dobie is a very good, efficient lecturer as well, but sometimes she throws out so much information at once that all you're left with in your notebook is ""Arabs!  Spain.""  If you aren't satisfied with your notes for a given day or you were absent, ask to take a gander at her lecture notes.  They're invaluable.
This is a great course overall, and I do recommend it, but do keep in mind as you go through it that the exams are much more factually oriented than is the class itself. 
Workload:
Lots of reading, but a small amount of graded work (two papers, both of which can be revised, and a midterm and final) ensures that you can do the reading on your own time.

One complaint  about the class was that the T/A session was an absolute waste of time and only complicated what Prof. Bakhle said.

Greg's class was extremely interesting and I enjoyed the nonstop discussions. We learned about contemporary issues that are actually pertinent to everyday life, something rarely found in college curriculumns. He's young, enthusiastic, and brings excellent insights into topics which have already been discussed at length (race, poverty, corporate exploitation, etc.) Pretty much what we did was read one book a week and talk about it, letting the conversation go where it wanted. I'm not sure what exactly I learned about ""evaluating evidence,"" but at least the class made me think. I'd definitely recommend it; everyone in the class was brilliant. From his teaching style I was under the impression that he truly cared about his students, and when he dropped us like a hot potato for the strike I felt extremely let down. That makes me question his committment to his students.

Prof. Balmer is an engaging lecturer; I was really only bored when the TAs gave lectures. My one BIG complaint is that he is quite arrogant, which I find to be completely inappropriate when teaching undergraduates. He assumes knowledge and then acts surprise when you don't know everything about the history of religion in America. Be prepared for this attitude -- it is quite infuriating.

Professor Riobo is a wonderful professor who leaves you feeling like you learned a great deal about the history of the Caribbean along with the rest of the world in his Lit. of the SP.

He is very open to participation and is a fair grader, if you have your sh*t together, you'll get a decent grade.

The class itself is fun and 2 hours go much quicker in S&S I than in CC or any other 2hr class I've taken.  The input from the class (and yes, people participate A LOT more than in core classes) is valuable at times, although people are sometimes quicker to say something harsh a la Masini to get her approval regardless of whether or not it is actually pertinent to your writing.  She is willing to help after class but sometimes she seemed to have this attitude that it was a burden to help you.  When I did meet with her I never really felt like I got a lot out of what she had to say - and usually she's just like ""rewrite this entire...""  She played favorites in the class, and underappreciated other peoples' great writing or great ideas.  I'm not sure how she grades - you have NO idea how you're doing in terms of that - the only grade I know is my expository writing log (write about a few poems, stories, etc) grade.  Basically, in writing for her she seems to like that bullsh*t sentimental stuff, all flowery and sorta cliche and angst-ridden stuff - she doesn't seem to be as big a fan of the stark, humorous qualities in writing.  Her comments basically flow along those lines.  The workload, however, is probably the lightest you can get for any class - basically write 1 poem, 1 short story, and 1 scene from a play and keep a writing log on some poems that you had to read from class.  Just on a side note - she knows nothing about Pop Culture - and even admitted that she just found out what the Knicks are (and she's been in the city forever).  That's it.

Prof. Dabashi is indeed a brilliant man, and has seemingly endless knowledge of the material, but somehow he never manages to get any of that knowledge across in his lectures.  He decries professors who simply read off a speech instead of actually teaching, but what he fails to realize is that his own method is just as ineffective: rambling on about tangents and discussing ad nauseum unrelated albeit interesting side-notes to the material.  I learned much more from reading the texts than going to class, unfortunately.
He schedules class once a week, but then insists on another meeting each week - okay, I don't know why he didn't just make it a normal twice-weekly class, but fine - except both meetings are on the same day!  I mean, come on, you have to actually PLAN the class ahead of time.  He enjoys cold-calling students, which is a valid method except he uses it more as a cautionary method of embarrassment (""see what happens when you don't do everything I say"") than an actual teaching method.  He says he is open to any and all theories, but he is very discouraging of any actual dissenting opinion.
Unfortunately, this class is required for students majoring in Comparative Literature.  If you are not a major, do yourself and the actual majors a favor: don't take this class.  You won't enjoy it and you will just crowd the class for the people who actually have to take it (Dabashi refuses to kick out the non-majors and the freshman who think it's an ""intro course,"" much to the chagrin of students who actually have to learn this material).

Karina is very nice.  And her intentions are good.  There, that's just about all I can say before I start complaining.  So no CC teacher is supposed to be an expert on the texts, but her entire body of knowledge seems to come from SparkNotes and Google.  She is only partially effective at regulating class discussion, so your experience will be subject to the luck of the draw regarding the class roster.
Most importantly, though, is that her grading is entirely subjective.  She likes to say that her grading is based on ""improvement,"" but what that means is that she grades you on your individual perfromance, not compared to the rest of the class.  Now, this is great for all you middle-of-the-curve students, but the truth is that if you're applying to grad school or competing for a scholarship or award, YOU ARE BEING COMPARED TO OTHER STUDENTS.  That's what grades mean, and while you don't have to have a perfect curve in every humanities class like in SEAS, it makes much less sense to have one student get an A- because they achieved their low potential while another writes a better paper but gets a B/B+ because they didn't achieve their higher potential.  It seems like grade-grubbing on  my part, I know, but in the end it seems like I should have deliberately started the semester off in airhead-mode so that by the end I would have seemed to have improved drastically.
Anyway, she's getting her Ph.D. this semester (Spring 2004), so she probably won't be teaching CC anymore.  However, I doubt her methods will change much.

Prof. Robbins is wonderful.  This is my second class with him, and the experience was great.  I was rather underqualified for this course, so I was prepared for much of the material to go over my head, but Prof. Robbins' lectures manage to make the dense philosophy clear and comprehensible without oversimplifying it.  He is passionate about his teaching, academia in general, and his scholarly pursuits, and he integrates his own research projects into the class without taking the focus away from the material itself.
A self-effacing and kind person, he is always available during office hours and by email to any student regarding any topic.

Sunil Gulati, former commisioner of Major League Soccer and an accomplished economist, makes what I think is an interesting subject phenomenonally fascinating and engaging.  He is hilarious, and will make jokes even in the most drudged of lectures.  He manages to involve most people out of a class of 300, something that I imagine is unique to large lectures.  Personally I never went to lab sections because the book and professor were so good that I was confident I knew what was going on.  Gulati was responsive to emails and questions and really knows his stuff.  There was only one annoying aspect of his class--sometimes he would spend half an hour engaging the audience in a question, such as ""if tariffs on imports are so inefficient, then why do we [the United States] have them?"" Then, after rejecting every answer he hears, Gulati will end the class or move on to something completely different.  Why will he never answer the question, or at least make some comment on it?  It seemed to be a big waste of time for me.  Thats what the lab sections are for, not lectures.

If you are a history major, this class will be a breeze. Foner, a great writer and important scholar, caters to the absolutely lowest common denominator in his lectures, which means you can skip them if you either know something about the time period or plan on doing the reading, which is substantial. The advantage to taking this class from a history major's perspective is being able to read the books on the list (some of which are skippable) and being able to go to his office hours. The great disappointment is that all of his lectures on Reconstruction, his specialty, come straight out of his book, which you can read on your own instead of listening to him read to you. The other students in the class are mostly non-history majors who don't do the reading and think he's an amazing lecturer because he's got a little personality and tells them things they should already know. If you want your money's worth, do the reading and pick his brain during office hours so that you can do more interesting things during class time.

Professor Boerger is the best thing that has happened to me at Barnard yet! She is the most incredibly professor ever! I came into her class with an appreciation for music and music background, but after one week in her class I looked at music in such a different way. I learned so much just from her lectures and countless stories and interesting facts she had about the composers, styles of music, and pieces we listened to. People with no music background can totally handle this class too, so no fears regarding that.  Professor Boerger obviously loves music (it is literally her life-she has a bunch of other jobs as a professional singer, conductor, etc.) and shares her passion with the students. Textbooks are necessary to buy but are practically never used.

     I agree with the observations of the other student who reviewed Prof. Prescott's teaching of the Colloquium, but heartily disagree with her response to this brilliant woman's teaching.  Yes, she often forgets to bring things with her to class, but just as often she remembers to provide the class with extra tidbit materials and books from her own personal library. She is a veritable library of information not only about her specialties (16th century: incl. Spenser) but about the whole Renaissance, including historical information and great references. I liked Professor Prescott so much for her scholarship, genuine compassion for students, zeal for teaching, and wit, that I took her 17th-Century poetry class as well.
     As for Prof. Prescott's bawdy comments and sexual innudendo, they are nothing but appropriate to the subject of Renaissance literature (if you are going to read Rabelais and Donne, you should be prepared for bawdiness and the subject of sex). I say ""right on"" to this professor of grandmotherly age's honesty about the content of Renaissance literature
    The last thing I must say is that Prof. Prescott is one of the most caring teachers I have encountered at Barnard or Columbia. She cares genuinely about her students, is enthusiastic about their work (but knows how to criticize and ask provocative questions when marking your assignments), and despite anything going on in her personal life puts her teaching and her students first.       If you are ready and willing not to flaunt your ivy-league laurels but to lose yourself in the beautiful confusion of metaphysical poetry, Cavalier poetry, Rabelais, Spenser, Montaigne, Bacon, Milton, and countless others, take a class with Professor Prescott.  Yes, the lectures sometimes get boring, and yes she is not the most organized person; she is, however, a gem among teachers and is not to be missed for those with a love of literature.

Professor Pagano is one of the people that has defined my college experience. He is a gem in the English department (and also the Chair of the English Dept. over at Manhattan School of Music) who goes far beyond the traditional canon to open up the world of fantasy literature for his students. The material in these two courses ranges from writers in the canon like Blake, Keats, Shakespeare, Tennyson, and Coleridge, to Tolkien (one of his greatest passions), Carroll, Rushdie, Hoffmann, Allende, Hong Kingston, and many more.  He also goes beyond the written word to illustrations (Blake, Coleridge), and paintings (Turner, Friedrich). There was not a single piece of literature on his syllabi that I did not enjoy, and for the ones I did not immediately understand, his passion and patience coaxed meaning and (I mean it) wonder out of them.
     Professor Pagano really cares about his students, and this is as evident as his love for the literature he teaches.  He also encourages creativity; for a few of my freewrites I wrote poems- and was not reproved but commended.  He also makes himself very available outside of class, to talk about issues both related to or not related to the material. I took Professor Pagano's classes both semesters of last year and I still keep in touch with him.  He is not to be missed.

Professor Smyslova, like all of the instructors I have had in my 6 semesters with the Slavic Department, is incredible. She is passionate and never misses a beat, and as any good language instructor she knows how to explain things in more than one way so that you really get it. Professor Smyslova's class took my Russian from understanding a lot but feeling mute to really being able to *speak* the language. She is an expert on helping native English speakers let go of the English syntax and sensibility and delve full-heartedly into Russian. The structure of the class is wonderful, and better than those of First-Year or Second-Year Russian; you have an ""aktivnaya leksika"" which means that instead of numbly memorizing lists of vocab, you read articles with the vocab embedded in them and are then required to summarize them in your own words, use the vocab words in different contexts, and keep bringing them up even as you move on to the next text.  Only in the most extreme cases will she resort to English. If you are taking Third-Year Russian you probably love the language as much as I do, but in case not, beware: you cannot get away with not doing your work or pretending to understand something when you do not. She commands your attention the entire class period and required as much energy from you as you get from her. She is extremely understanding, though, as long as you put in the effort.

Professor Green (or Josh, as he prefers you call him) changed the way I write. He focuses not on the product but the writing process, and encourages you to go beyond the style you are set in- to test the limits of syntax, grammar, and usage and really play with the language. He is extremely well-versed (pun fully intended) in poetry and brings a lot of scholarship to his consideration of student work. 
     I went into Josh's class having written poetry since age 10 and with a portfolio pretty similar all the way through, being prone to excessive modifiers and cliched arrangements of language. I left it with a portfolio stocked with many different types of poetry, and with a much more provocative and personal style. Don't miss out on the chance to study with Professor Green- he is a true lover of reading and writing poetry, and has a Shakespearean goatee to match.

I don't know why I am complaing about this class. It was the easiest class I've ever taken, I didn't need to go to class, studied an hour before the exam, and still did well. BUT-the class was so easy that I actually found it to be insulting. This was not a college level course. I bet my AP statistics class in high school was way harder. The tests are open book and notes-so I really can't say I learned anything. You just had to spit the notes back onto the test, and you'd get an A. No thinking needed at all. I have no problem AT ALL taking an easy class, it was great actually...but it was also such a waste of time. Plus, it seemed like Zahner didn't want to come to recitations more than we did.  The recitations (originally 2 hours, cut down to 1...) were optional and she cancelled them frequently.  
So the class was easy, and you probably should take it just to boost your GPA. In fact, i'd probably take it again. i was just frustrated at how low the level of the class was.

In my opinion, the other reviews couldn't be more off.  Yes, she does require a lot of work and she is definately tough--but what you get in return more than makes up for it.  I switched into this section from my old one, where very little work was required, and the grading was lenient (ish), but no one was EVER allowed to talk.  In this class, participation was required and the class really benefitted.  Prof. Dickey really made me understand CC on  a much higher level.  Seriously, even if you don't think its possible to like CC, but you do like classes where you are forced to think and speak, then take this class.  She really makes it worth your while.
Workload:
Very heavy.  She adds a number of books (but they are all fascinating, worthwhile reads), and requires weekly response essays (just one paragraph long though).  Class participation is required.

One problem I had with this class is that it's at a strange 2000 level.  There are freshman from Columbia and grad students from Juilliard in this class....I don't know how Professor Sisman factors this in when she gives us our grades.  Music analysis can get pretty technical and it is easy to get lost.  I really wonder how many people in that class could follow what the professor was talking about.  Readings can also get technical and boring, depending on the book.

You can get a good idea about the class itself from the other reviews: decent lectures, if you like blue monkeys, all together not a horrible way to get through the science requirement, but go for Human Species if you want a really good course.  
The problem is that the E3B department is so diverse in terms of grad students that the TAs this semester study elephant genetics (no, I'm not kidding) and fungi or something like that.  They know less about monkeys than I do, which is saying something.  They tried to help, but when they're reading the stuff along with you, they can't answer any real questions, and are completely unhelpful.  I talked to my friend who'd taken the class last year, and she was more helpful.  Get a clue E3B: use undergrad TAs, or get a lot more grad students interested in monkey sex.

1.) Really cool English accent
2.) He's never taught this class before, so he didn't seem to realize that it was a 1000-level intro class.  His expectations were WAY too high
3.) So it was hard.  The readings are dense, his lectures are disorganized, and he doesn't answer email (go to his office hours).
In general, I hated the class, but it wasn't totally his fault.  The subject is hard, and too large in scope to cover in a semester.

And she's just really friendly and fun to talk to as well. Yes, it's her first year as a full-time teacher and she can be a bit scatterbrained at times, but you will not find another professor at this school who cares as much about teaching you weird non-canonical 16th and 17th century texts as she does.

In accordance with the majority of the other reviews, this class is essentially information-overload.  It can't be denied, the lectures are horribly interesting and some of the slides are breathtaking.  The conceptual analysis required on the midterm and final, however, is not mentioned until the class before.  Attention to minute detail suddenly becomes intensely theoretical  I believe that if Prof. D'Altroy could strike a balance between the detail and the theory, he would really have quite a class.

Although absent for the last week and a half of classes due to the grad student strike, Michael is a dedicated, supportive, and knowledgeable instructor.  While he may not possess a wealth of knowledge regarding the works on the scale of Seidel, he knows his stuff and has many very elucidating points to share.  His classes may not have been incredible discussion oriented (mainly because it was a 9am section) but there were never any awkward silences.  I have to give him snaps for those well-prepared, early morning performances.

Mendelson is an interesting character.  I can't say I didn't like him as a person.  He can come off as gruff and intense to say the least, but in person he is really friendly.  I DO NOT recommend him for poetry, especially at 9am.  Sure, he's knowlegeable about the poetry (or it seemed like it at lease) but the lectures consist entirely of rambling, almost always incoherent diatribes where he reads huge chunks of the poems, says, ""In other words..."" says something random, and then asks (demands of) the class, ""Are you getting my meaning here?""  He harps on the same themes constantly, and by the end of the semester I was still waiting to actually learn something about Auden beyond what I could have gotten by purchasing a copy of his selected works (edited, of course, by Mendelson himself) and reading them on my own.  I don't know if all poetry classes leave one feeling this dissatisfied, but this one definitely did.

I think whether or not you like this course is dependent on what your expectations are coming into it.  If you're a non-science major who wants as little to do with science as possible (like me), you'll hate it, everything about it.  If, on the other hand, you take an open mind to the class and expect that there's going to be some interesting (some would say off-topic and inane) material covered, all at warp speed, then by golly, you might even like the class.  Can't say much bad about Helfand as a person, although his teaching skills are not finely tuned to the audience - he goes way too fast and goes off into concepts that are impossible to explain in the incredibly short time he gives them.

I took four year of Spanish in high school, but I figured ""Hey, I spent a significant amount of time learning Spanish, why forget it now?"" Thus, I took this course thinking it would be a brainless A. It's certainly brainless, but it's by no means a guaranteed A. Prof. Borgman knows Spanish, but doesn't (if that makes any sense). I caught her in numerous grammatical and conceptual errors, but, figuring I shouldn't trifle with the woman who controls my grade, I said nothing. In fact, she directly conrtadicted her packet on the subjunctive three times in one class. I would be ok with that if she was correcting the packet, but the opposite was true.

Professor Navratil will occasionally break from the physics to show where we actually see the stuff in a lab, but that hardly compensates for how little depth the class goes into.

In all honesty, Martha is possibly the best instructor I've had at Columbia thus far.  She is extremely intelligent but she applies this towards making her students think critically.  Reading is a must if you want to participate, and participation is key if you hope to get a good grade.  Her grading is pretty harsh, but she forces you to improve in grading so hard.

Ben O'Shaughnessy is an awful teacher.  This course is marketed as an in depth survey of biological topics of interest to scientists without a background in biology.  In truth, this course in my opinion is a chance for O'Shaughnessy to try to learn biology and to reinforce his understanding by reading to the class (largely word for word, I kid you not) from an introductory biology text for three hours a week.

He has a prediliction for the underrepresented in literature (African-Amercan, Immigrant, Jewish....), but doesn't beat this over your head at the expense of the larger value of a work.  Seeks active participation and loves encouraging discussion in the classroom. He likes showing classic movies based on the books you are reading and comparing and contrasting with books.

I completely agree with the first two reviews. I switched Lit Hum professors mid-year and it was the best move I made the whole semester. For me, Lit Hum transformed from a boring, lifeless, bullshit class into what I would consider my most enjoyable and scintillating class all semester. Golston is everything a lit hum professor should be... he is incredibly bright, encourages class participation (but by no means relies on it like my first semester lit hum prof), provides insightful and poignant comments into the works read, and to top it all off, he's entertaining. One particular aspect of the class I enjoyed was the historical contexts he would place the books in. He sometimes devoted whole class times to lecturing on a book's background before we actually delved into discussion. (He is a truly inspiring lecturer.) It was obvious he put much time into preparing for the class. In grading essays, he doesn't slap an arbitrary letter on... you will receive a number of insightful comments, and he will be honest if your essay is BS.

Onatski is a really nice guy, and his class can be entertaining at times.  He really cares about his students, and he definitely knows what he's talking about.
That said, rumors that macro would be an easy A seemed totally inacurate.  Truthfully, lecture was a waste of time.  He seemed to dance around complicated derivations or incredibly superficial experimental data.  Problem sets were a pain, and problems in general were so difficult because he never gave us any examples to work off of in the class!  TA's just went over homework problems, but it would have been nice if the basics in problem solving were actually explained, because it would have saved me a lot of time!  Furthermore, and this is probably more the TA's fault, but NO partial credit was given on the midterm, and probably wont' be given on the final exam.  This was VERY frustrating especially when there were questions that relied on previous parts!  In all, it was a frustrating class because I never knew what was going on, even tho I went to every lecture.  There's barely any math in this class btw, only simple geometric series and maybe a couple of derivatives.  Macro seemed easy once I learned the stuff on my own... but yeah.

Like any writing workshop, this class will be a shooting star if the writers are all good, or will feel like banging a nail through your hand if the writers stink.

She is very respectful of your writing but also able to give good criticism.

Mac Adam is very nice, and it is clear that he cares about his students.  And he is certainly very smart.  At its best, his discussion of Borges's short stories is nothing less than brilliant.  He does a good job with Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude and Machado de Assis's The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas as well.  After such a wonderful start, however, the course plummets.  I found the readings, which in other reviews have been described as so enjoyable, to be consistently embarrassing.  Perhaps the reason reading these books ""doesn't feel like work"" is because they aren't nearly of a high enough quality to be appropriate for a college course.  Books like Vargas Llosa's Who Killed Palomino Molero?, which Mac Adam translated, were almost bad enough to turn me off to Latin American Literature altogether.  Furthermore, as the course progresses, you discover that brilliant as he may be, Mac Adam only knows one terribly unsatisfying way to teach a book: he spends the majority of the class providing you with a huge amount of mostly useless information about a writer's life (i.e. what awards he or she has won); when he finally gets to discussing the book itself, he simply moves through the text chronologically, offering a rushed summary of each chapter.
My advice: read One Hundred Years of Solitude, The Posthumous Memoirs of Bras Cubas, and Borges's short stories on your own.  They're all amazing books.  But stay away from this class.  It's the first course in which I've skipped over entire books--not to mention weeks of class.  I felt that doing anything more than was required would be a waste of my time.

We weren't exactly sure whether he was a professor, a grad student, or somewhere in between until the TA strike (he's somewhere in between, probably will be an Assistant Professor by the time someone else checks this) and we're not exactly sure what his specialty is and we don't know why he always brings organic cookies and brownies to class and we don't know why he starts enthusiastically yelling about certain passages. 
To clarify: he's GOOD. And a lot of fun. 
He's a bit goofy, and his approach to teaching is somewhat scattershot--he can get REALLY out there--but this year was his first so it will probably be tightened up by next year. He's extremely accessible and will talk to you for hours after class, if his schedule permits (at this time, he teaches at other schools in the area). Sometimes you're unsure if he knows what he's talking about (mainly when he starts going on historical tangents) but he usually ends up making a point, and, plus, its always entertaining. 
He has read the books through and through and will be able to pick up any reference you make in class and let you run with it, but will kindly stop you if you're being a jackass. 
For some reason, he was much better first semester (although he caught steam again after spring break)...it was unclear because the class was structured in a circle (instead of mini-lecture when we switched for 2nd sem), because the class changed, because he pop-quizzed us on the readings every class 1st semester so we followed the class better, or just because St. Augustine sucks.
He's definitely worth it. Both semesters. Don't be worried if he seems weird the first day. Its part of his charm.
Workload:
Not bad, especially  if you do the reading. 
 Pulling an flat A is hard. Pulling a B- is even harder. Showing up, following the class, and doing the work should guarantee you at least a B+. You'd be surprised how many people don't do that.
A series of short papers (detailed below, he'll often order ""NO MORE THAN THREE PAGES"") and a midterm (feels hard but most do well) and final. He's relatively lenient about extensions if you're honest, and will let you retool papers if you feel like you didn't do your best. HIS COMMENTS ARE INCREDIBLE. He spends about an hour on each paper, and picks apart every bit of your prose and argument, and still grades lightly. To second the other reviewers I wish we had drafts in the class.
he'll probably change the requirements next year, but...
First semester: a (very easy) 2 page paper on  the Iliad, a 3-5 page paper on the Odyssey, a 3-5 page paper on the rest of the greek stuff, a 3-5 pager on the books of the bible
Second semester: two 5-7 page papers, each looking at a specific theme in three books. Not hard, although the topics are a bit overwrought and the papers can be a pain to cobble together. But they're really not that bad (especially compared with the crap other classes get) and the comments are worth it.

This class is the most interesting one I've take thus far at columbia.  You learn about current events and controversial issues through the speeches everyone makes (you choose your own speech topics in the categories of informative, persuasive, controversial, group speech) and your public speaking and rhetoric skills vastly improve.

I wish they'd make more publiuc speaking classes available because as this class teaches you, whether you want to go into business, marketing, pr, public policy, politics, law, journalism, whatever....the ability to speak publically at a high level is vital...because what's the point of filling our minds with all these great ideas and all this knowledge if we can't articulate them clearly, communicate these ideas, and influence or teach others about them?

Prof. Claybaugh got a teaching award this year so right off the bat that should tell you she's worth taking. She's very insightful, and like the other reviewers have said, she makes you want to read the books. She takes pride in her lectures, too - they were always well thought out and prepared. The reading list is great: Mansfield Park, Jane Eyre, Bleak House, Middle March, Jude the Obscure, Picture of Dorian Gray and Heart of Darkness. My only complaint is that she's very...historical. Which is fitting, I guess, but I was looking for more of a thematic analysis of the books. We'd never discuss WHY someone did something but the historical context around that decision. So, too, her expectations are different. In exams and papers, she asks for a formal analysis of character, plot  and narration rather than a structural one. It was so foreign to us that the TA actually had to get up and explain what a formal analysis was! Bottom line: her style takes a little getting used, to -- but it was definitely an enjoyable experience. She gets excited student response to literature, she's lerned, and is SO helpful during office hours.

After all, he spoke of his experiences as a writer and I want to BE one --but most of the time I found his comments self-involved, common-sensical and unenlightening.

In general her grading was fair, she cared A LOT about the calculations so watch out, be sure youÂ’ve got those down cold. SheÂ’s very receptive to questions and she doesnÂ’t mind questions or helping you out during lab. She is strict with safety but I donÂ’t blame her. She doesnÂ’t get pissed if you break something and she understands that everyone just wants to get out of there as soon as possible. Her lectures are semi-useful. She is clear and concise and gets right to the point, though you can pretty much find a majority of what she says in the lab manual. Listening to her isnÂ’t such a bad idea though. She is DEFINITELY your best option for this class!! Qazi Hai was there during the final and the man seems like a freaking nut!

Professor Mann is without a doubt intelligent; however he is consumed with the pedantry of a classical philologist. At no point during his seemingly endless lectures did anything of philosophical interest emerge. The majority of the class was spent pondering how to translate and re-translate various Greek terms, I guess in the hopes that such a futile exercise would give fuller meaning to AristotleÂ’s already dry and ponderous texts. The result was an exquisite torture that not even Dante could have concocted.  Abandon all hope ye who enter this class.

This class should be entitled Â‘Welcome to RobbinsworldÂ’ or Â‘Being Bruce Robbins.Â’ The reading list is top notch, but the texts arenÂ’t really considered for their own value so much as they are shown to be the building blocks for RobbinsÂ’ Meta-narrative/Master-Plan. As has been noted before, this plays right into the hands of the Robbins groupies who eat it up like candy.

One of ColumbiaÂ’s great aging intellectual powerhouses, Professor White has the singular ability to go from the sublime to the ridiculous without skipping a beat.

There were a number of interesting conversations, and I donÂ’t regret taking the class; however, I am really none the wiser about the sociology of the arts, sociological method, or the workings of the Artworld.

He's a genuinely nice guy, with even a little sense of humor. He seems to wish his subject matter was more interesting, which leads him to somehow tie in moral philosophy and other abstract stuff to IPE.  The material starts off OK, until you realize that the same topic discussed in week 1 will be basically the entire theme of the year. There were 2 papers, a midterm, and a final, and all of them aksed the same annoying question: how do states affect the economy? It hardly went more in-depth than that.  By the last month of class, Flibbter hardly lectured, opening up the floor for random ppl to talk about McDonalds in Japan and whatnot. Overall, you'll read up on current views on globalization and Multi-National Corporations and the like, but won't come out with any real understanding of the subject.

Truth is, I don't remember her saying much. Each week, a few ppl presented the readings, and then she sort of monitored the discussion, but thats about it. However, she was helpful during office hours and in her comments after we presented our research to the class. She is very knowledgeable, but hardly shows it during class. The readings are standard IR readings, except for the psychology crap that was barely understandable and for the most part ignored by the class. You wont love the class, you wont hate it.

This is the second class I have taken with Loizzo--there will not be a third. He's a nice guy, and he can be amusing at times, but for my money I want a teacher who can deliver a clear lecture and/or facilitate a class discussion.  Loizzo does neither.   He sputters and rambles and has trouble getting to the point.  There were some interesting readings but going to class was a huge waste of time.  I got nothing out of this course that I wouldn't have gotten by doing the readings on my own.
Also, don't be fooled by the title, you won't really learn about the science of religious experience.  In fact the few readings that actually had anything to do with science came at the tail end of the course, and after so much foreplay they didn't live up to expectations.  The subtitle ""The Nature and Culture of Contemplative States"" is more accurate.

No offense to all who posted before me, but this class was by far the easiest class I have ever taken in Columbia. You just do the readings the night before, and take the 3 OPEN BOOK, OPEN NOTE quizzes. Everyone seems to bitch about his multiple choice method where u check the wrong answers, but really it just allows you to pick up free points even when you dont know the answer, by checking the obviiously wrong answers. i slept through most of the lectures, writing notes in my sleep, but the quizzes are fairly redundant, with most questions just a different wording than some previous ones. Granted, you wont learn a damned thing. Galantar seemed to be teaching us psychological breakthoughs of the 1940's rather anything current or interesting. Although, he's your typical old fart with great old fart humor. 
Normally, Id hate to bust everyone else's balls, but I feel I owe the Columbia community a service by recommending this class - trust me, it is not nearly as hard as these reviews make it out, and I know for certain that other students agree with me. And all the reviews from previous semesters agree with me. Did the 1,000 yr old Galantar change his tests and grading policies all of a sudden for this past semester and make his class harder? doubtful.
This IS the science requirement to take.

A wonderful young professor. Although he is new at Columbia and very young, you will see his passion and enthusiasm from his teaching. His lecture is extremely organized and thoroughly well prepared. If you are an IEOR major (Or non-IEOR major who is interested in business management), you must take his course to see how the stuff we learned from other IEOR classes practically implemented in the real world. 
He absolutely has in-depth knowledge in the subject matter and clearly delivers it with details and practical examples. Since his lecture is so practical and informative, you never feel bored (I hardly see people making absence for his class even though all the lecture notes and power points slides he uses are provided through online). In addition, he is a very friendly and considerate person and concerned every student keeps up with his class. A highly recommended class.

Some people, however nice they may be, simply do not make good teacher. Vivette is nice.  Vivette is not a good teacher.
It was more than obvious that this was her first time in front of a classroom.  She didn't know how to conduct simple things. She unwisely indulged pointless inquiries that managed to get large chunks of the class off track.
It is obvious that she was more comfortable with certain topics than others.  Those for which she was shaky, it showed.  Lectures consisted of re-stating what the text had to say on such topics.  If asked a question, she would nervously defer to the TA.  As a result, multiple lectures, even for the most attentive student, were incoherent and desperate sprints to make it past the topic. What was more frustrating, however, was the fact that such topics were explored on the problem sets -- and often the class was left without the tools to solve them.
She also was hell-bent on covering an entire 700 page text in one semester.  Each chapter was given a lecture.  Some chapters were over 50 pages long and contained extremely detailed information that should have been given considerably more time.  Other chapters were vague, soft sketches that could have been condensed rather than dwelled on for entire lectures.  Basically, better planning regarding lecture content would have been appreciated.

Professor Leighton is by far one of the best pre-med professors I've had.  I agree with the other review that there is a great deal of competition in this class but that's true of any class, especially the pre-med requirements.  Leighton's concern for his students is evident from day one when he tells you that he is not out to make this a pre-med weeding out course but is more interested in you learning the material.  He takes his time to draw out mechanisms carefully and throughly explain things.  If you still have questions, his TA's were great and he is always available either by email or in his office hours.  He also would hold extra office hours before exams and tried to ensure that you had every opportunity to get all your questions answered.  He's a great lecturer and cracks the occassional joke.

He is extremely nice, very self-effacing, very very very committed to his work, both teaching and studying (which I find to be rare at this institution).  For him, it's all about close-reading and the texts--if you don't like doing that, you will not like this class.  His major problem is that his thinking on the texts, which I think is fundamentally sound and ultimately very interesting, is nonetheless pretty disorganized, and I (and many others) found the lectures very very hard to follow once the class had moved beyond stories we had all heard and number of times and read at least twice (Odyssey, Iliad, Metamorphoses).  But he really seems like he wants you to do well, that is, wants those who are decent at close-reading to do well, because he bends over backwards in assigning to fit your needs.

At first, I found this class to be very difficult.  The assigned reading was very long, and, having never taken a sociology course before, I was unfamiliar with many of the theories and felt like they were a little over my head.  However, Denise is a great instructor.  She was always positive and listened to everyone's comments.  Her lectures helped to explain some of the more difficult concepts from the reading, and, often, her lectures were led by providing answers to everyone's questions at the beginning of each class.  Denise was very nice, and very approachable.  Although I wasn't particularly enthusiastic about sociology at first, taking this class made the field more interesting to me, and it turned out to be a good experience.

I'm torn between my ultimate opinion on the class.  I learned more in this class than in any other at Columbia, much (if not all) of this is because of Professor Neuhouser.  His lectures were well organized, concise, and yet still offered incredibly developed perspective on social discussion.  Class discussion is encouraged, and he enjoys watching students figure out the material, though he has no problem telling you you're wrong (favorite moment in class: watch Neuhouser look at a student with this huge smile, shake his head, and say ""You couldn't be more wrong!"")  This atmosphere provides a great learning opportunity, but it can also become intimidating and stressful.  I did have a difficult time with the grading system.  I was less concerned with my grade than the fact that I couldn't improve.  I spent more than twice the time on my second paper (both by myself, and in consultation with him), and yet I did substantially better on the first.  More to the point, I could not figure out what I could do to improve, and I was even marked down for comments that we had discussed should be put in my paper.  If I had to decide whether to take this class again, I would sign up in a heartbeat.  In spite of difficulties with the written assignments, I learned more from this class than I ever thought possible.  Professor Neuhouser was a phenomenal and interested lecturer, and the work that goes into this class will pay off ten-fold.  If you are interested by Smith, Hegel, Marx, and Weber; take this class.

If you are in this section, stay there.  Do not let yourself be intimidated by a slightly harder workload.  Clark is easily the most passionate teacher that I have had at Columbia, and I enjoyed every class even if I didn't agree with his opinions.  Shannan does an excellent job of running the class without stifling student discussion.  He also is incredibly committed to the students' education, and it shows.  He is never late; in fact he is ten minutes earlier, and hangs around for ten minutes afterwards to answer questions.  He will always find time for students, even if they want to talk about something other than schoolwork.  Shannan says that CC is intended to create better citizens and people, and he believes this so adamantly that he convinced me of it.  This is perhaps the most valuable part of his class; Shannan gave a sense that our education is not just a cocktail party stimulator.  If you have the opportunity to take a CC with him, go for it.  You will learn a ton, but more importantly, you will enjoy CC.

His lecture style was never aloof or boring, but as though he was sharing what he loved with a few friends.

The class is a bitch class, and I would never have taken it with anyone else - heck, he's not teaching II next semester, so there's no way I'll be taking it. There's SO much work involved - busywork from that Grevisse book, and writing assignments every week, if not practically every class (or so it seemed at times). But he works so hard preparing for class and grading and correcting all our stuff, it makes you not mind working just as hard for him. As corny as this sounds, he cares about his students. And he's got the skills too - you learn so much in his class. He's one of the best TEACHERS I've ever had. The first time I took class with him I was a first semester freshman who enjoyed myself, but didn't have any background for comparison him. As a rising senior with six semesters of various professors behind me, I can now fully appreciate just how rare this kind of pedagogical talent is in Columbia. Heck, it's probably rare anywhere.

Emmet is a really nice lady who makes herself available to students. The material of the course ranges from rogue memorization of locations and functions of different parts of the brain (boring)  to interesting case studies. Her exams are very tricky. She expects you to know every little detail of each topic, so that she'll ask you a very basic question on one topic that you know in-depth, and a nitpicky question on a topic that you didn't even bother studying, or that you have no recollection of even learning. I probably would not take this class again if I had the choice.

IÂ’ll be honest.  Initially, I did not like Professor Seidel.  While it isnÂ’t hard to get on his good side, he is not a warm and fuzzy guy.  I always felt awkward with him.  I tried to go to office hours to get a feel for what he thought of me, but it was always uncomfortable.
IÂ’ll get the rest of the bad stuff out of the way.  LitHum is about discussion, and there was none in my classÂ– the only way to speak was to interrupt Seidel mid-sentence.  I, for one, never thought that anything I had to say was particularly important, so I kept my mouth shut.  Not a good discussion class for a quiet student (or an intimidated one).  So if you want negatives, heÂ’s not an IÂ’m-going-to-form-a-wonderful-friendship-with-you type of guy, and the discussion is almost nonexistent.
However, Professor Seidel quickly transformed into one of the greatest teachers I have ever had.  The amount of knowledge he possesses is extraordinary.  I thought that after we finished the first semester ancient Greek works he would fizzle out, but that was not the caseÂ—his knowledge of the second semester works was equally impressive.  He initially seems strict and even pretentious, but he is more easygoing than he lets on, as long as you donÂ’t come late or fall asleep in class.  His humor is implicitly hilarious, and the amount of work he must put into the class stuns meÂ–he reads everyoneÂ’s journals and responds in detail for every class session and has papers back with extensive comments by the class after they are due.  Professor Seidel will make you a better writer whether you like it or notÂ– heÂ’ll even refuse to read your papers if they arenÂ’t up to his format standards.  ItÂ’s frustrating at first, but worth it in the end.
So in closing, even though my LitHum class was unconventional, I would gladly do it over again. Professor Seidel made me truly love and care about books that I would never have read on my own.  He made me spend hours on papers that were just one page long.  And he made me love LitHum to the point that I frighten myself.

I'm somewhat puzzled by all the positive reviews here.  I've just finished his much-heralded Joyce class, and I can unequivocally say that it was one of the worst English classes I've taken at Columbia.  And I've taken some seriously bad classes.  I found myself dreading this class before each and every meeting.  Seidel is boring, and bizarrely fixated on a very few analytic tropes.  For instance, you could either attend the first month and a half of the class, or else simply sit in your room repeating, ""Paralysis, gnomon, simony,"" to yourself over and over.  This is a class of buzzwords, and very few of them will help you in the least when it comes to understanding Joyce.  This simply makes his lectures a bore - what makes his lectures worse than a bore is his insistence that the only way to get at the meaning of Joyce's books is to know his biography.  ""Biography"" is probably putting it too generously, actually.  What he thinks one ought to know is, say, that Buck Mulligan from Ulysses was probably based on this particular friend of Joyce's (a connection Seidel makes by displaying a Power--
Point image of the friend).  This is his approach to all of Joyce.  Want to understand Simon Dedalus?  Go no further than Joyce's father.  Molly Bloom?  Simply look at a picture of Nora Barnacle.  For Seidel, literary analysis means little more than mapping characters and places in novels onto their real-life correlatives.  If this sounds misguided to you, then this class will drive you nuts.  Seidel seems perfectly good-natured, and his lecturing style is fluent (smoothed by years of repetition, I'd imagine).  I took the class because I wanted to ""get"" Joyce before leaving Columbia, and I honestly don't feel any closer.  I'd advise you to pick up the books on your own - preferably annotated editions - and to dive right in.  Taking this class runs the risk of turning you off to Joyce for life.
Workload:
Reasonable, although the midterm and final are both tedious.  They are long reading quizzes, which says something about the depth of Seidel's interest in what students have to say.

Whoever says that this class is pure sleep time is completely wrong. In fact I liked Irina's class very much. She does not just bombard you with information about art works but she makes you think about them and appreciate the works. I was in another Art Hum section before this one and it was absolutely boring. However, when I changed to her section the material became so much more interesting since she know how to present it. She is also very easygoing. If you have a legitimate reason she will give you an extension for papers. Her exams consist of comparisons and essay questions. Comparisons are easy since she discusses the differences between artists quite in detail. And the essay questions are handed out beforehand and you pick one out of three in the exam. Papers are also easy but you have to go and see the works which takes time. In general, she is the ideal professor for ArtHum. Easy, interesting, fun,... What do you want more?

Even though Sigman is a very good teacher this class is poorly taught. How is this possible? Well, the class is only once a week and it is 2.5 hour lecture. However, neither the students nor Sigman can sit there for 2.5 hours. Therefore, he has to skim over the material and he never has time to solve complicated problems. If this class were twice a week, I am sure that everyone would learn much more. The material is complex but not too hard. His first exam was easy. The second one was mad hard (mean was 40 out of 90) and the final was slightly easier than the second exam. He is a very calm and good teacher.

Anderson is an excellent professor.  He knows the material well, knows how to present it well, and (though sometimes he makes it clear that he really doesn't agree) is interested in what the students have to say.
The texts we read (from the Magic Flute to Sebald) are uniformly good reads.  This is one of the few heavy reading (relatively heavy, often a novel a week, though sometimes just some poetry) classes I had in which I've done all the reading and wanted to do it.
Don't expect too much music though.  Anderson is a literature prof.  He seems to be a big music fan, but it's not his area.  With some of the works the connection to music is pretty much abandoned.  That said, some of the connections were really insightful.

Khalidi is an excellent lecturer (although at times he has a tendency to go out on fifteen minute tangents). This class will give you a great historical perspective of the region - from Ottoman times up to the present. He also provides you with background in Arabic intellectual and political culture which was both interesting and useful. Besides being very knowledgeable and honest about many potentially inflammatory topics, Khalidi's knowledge about the Middle East is truly world class. He lived in Beirut in the 1970's, is Palestinian, and has met some historic figures in person. Take this class it is well worth it. The required reading is very reasonable - One big thick book, three smaller ones and a handful of essays. If you want more he provides an exstensive list of optional reading.

First, you do NOT need an extensive background in anything to take Prof. Bakhle's classes, especially if you take both topics and gandhi's india in sequence. I actually do have an above-average knowledge of south asian history simply by having taking courses in high school and I was sometimes frustrated by the fact that she gives us great readings (for example, key texts in subaltern studies, a very interesting school of s.asian historiography (which will be of immense importance to you if you have problems with nationalist and imperialist  historiography) of which Partha Chatterjee, who teaches here, is a big member) but doesnt talk about them as much as facts and dates. Still, she is very willing to talk in office hours and speak to your specific level of knowledge. 
Second, I too will warn you that she really is  a bitch on wheels if your cellphone goes off or if you come late. The origin of this idiosyncrasy is interesting in its own right: As on of Edward Said's students she has absorbed his classroom style which I hear was very no bullshit.
Last, she tries hard to be a teacher (more than just a lecturer) even in a big class and this really comes through in office hours if you care to go.

Previous reviewers have largely missed the point here.  The problem with this class is not that it's biologically oriented; clearly, if you don't want to learn about the biology you shouldn't take this class.  The problem is that Wiedenmayer  \does not understand the biology well enough.  In fact, I got the general impression that he's just not that bright.  Several times, Wiedenmayer described the procedure and results of some experiment, then would claim a conclusion that didn't really seem to follow.  When he was questioned because of this, he would typically answer politely, but not really engage with the point made by the questioner.  Sometimes he would defer, erroneously claiming that everything would be clarified later, sometimes he would just repeat something he had already said, even though it wasn't really relevant.   (Note to previous reviewer: Yes there were some dumb questions.  But there were also a lot of intelligent questions that he treated as if they were dumb.)  Additionally, he seemed to inappropriately simplify (e.g. his explanation of evolution) or simply get wrong (e.g. his description of the work of Stephen Pinker)  some basic facts and concepts.  There were some other shortcomings to this class.  The exams focused entirely on vocabulary, not abstraction.  That is, they measured only how well you had memorized the lectures, not how well you understood the concepts.  I realize that in a class like this a significant amount of memorization is appropriate, however, I think it should be better balanced.  For instance, the essay questions could ask you to explain an experimental result or  consider a theory, rather than simply  asking you to repeat facts learned in class.
Also, the class was seemingly filled with freshmen satisfying their science requirement, who seemed to feel that it was totally acceptable for them to talk loudly through class, which could be fairly distracting.
Despite all of this, the class was far from a  waste.  While, I think Wiedenmayer's understanding of the material is somewhat lacking, he is reasonably good at presenting what he does understand.  Also, the textbook is pretty good (although largely unneccessary).  I came away from this class, having learned a significant amount of neuroscience, which I think is a fascinating subject.

Saliba is a good, not great, teacher.  On the first day, he got a little crazy and went on a couple anti-Israel rants, but after we got into the readings, he seemed to settle down.

You read some interesting essays and treatises, but a lot of them are based on fuzzy logic and nebulous history.   My TA (Hossein) was great in leading discussion and pointing out where and how these works failed and succeeded in making sense.
Another thing about this course is that the role Saliba has in this class is to come in twice a week and lecture, whereas all of the learning occurs in the section.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, as Saliba's lectures are usually interesting, it just means you have to choose a good TA.

This was a good seminar, but i felt like it didn't have the coherent thrust that it could have had.  We started off by asking ""What is Regime Change?"" and i'm not sure that we continually referred back to that question enough.  The whole point of a seminar of course, is the paper, and this one is a little overwhelming.  I got the sense that no one really knew what they wanted to write until about a week before it was due.  But it was okay, Weinberger is very knowledgeable, relaxed, flexible. Definitely recommended.

I suspect that you will not have to worry about this class being on the schedule again; but in reality it's not like we really did any previewing.  Erikson might just be the country's leading scholar on voting in America (he came up with the ""sophomore surge"" idea), but he doesn't show it.  This class quickly became: review the previous week in politics, which was fun, and then was half an hour talking about reading that no one did, or just doing something completely random.  This class could have been fantastic--we could have each taken a battleground state, and predicted how we felt the election might go there, or we could have tackled something as a class, but we ended up doing random, shitty research project.  I'm not so happy.

One of the most interesting courses I've taken.  Denise is extreemly intelligent,  approachable, and insightful.  She encourages class participation.  It is part of your grade.  If you give a wrong answer, she  is not be condesending.   Her assignments are intense and erudite.  They require a great deal of time and attention.  However they are interesting and often topical.   You probably wont understand everything, or sometimes most, of what you've read.  Don't panic.   Denise's visual diagrams will clear things up in class.   I would encourage you to take this course, or anything that Denise Milstein instructs.   She's a winner!

I really hated this class. Joyce has three books and one crappy play to his name, so after 30 years of studying him, Seidel is more interested in trivia than the substance of the material. He spends way too much time on biographical information, and hearing him jump from quote to quote in his nasal voice is unbearable. No one doubts that Seidel loves the man. The problem is he loves him too much. His obsession is uncritical, with him being fascinated by the most meaningless crap. I also didn't get the impression that Seidel was a particularly nice guy. He hardly takes any questions, aside from the occasional brown nosing (""could it also mean this, professor?"" ""yes, yes it could""), and he's unfriendly when approached after class. I really just got the impression that he had been teaching the material too long. I wanted an introduction, but instead I glimpse into the cult of Joyce. Very dissapointing.

I took this class to complete my science sequence requirement, which I understand they just got rid of (bastards!). Overall, I thought it was pretty good. The material ranges from blandish terms to pop science-y stuff, with the material getting better in the second half of the semester. The lectures are super-organized, with him whipping through power point. it's hard to keep up with sometimes, but he provides old lecture notes online that help come test time. My real problem with the class is that he was kind of a jerk. He didn't do anything that overtly mean, other than give stupid answers to stupid questions, but I didn't get the sense he liked students that much. He just gives off that vibe. He's also completely inflexible and horrifically anal, so don;t bother asking for extensions.

I would encourage anyone to take this class. I loved it. I would list it as one of my top five best classes at the university; as a major, it was definitely the best one in the music department. Yes, it is an elective, and non-majors can take it, so it doesn't cater to hardcore music theorists or historical musicologists.

Furthermore, the most important thing I took away from this class was a newfound appreciation for Caribbean cultures. I even learned to salsa dance!

Rebecca is an exercise in trade-offs.
On one hand, she GIVES YOU EXACTLY WHAT YOU WILL BE TESTED ON in excellently outlined notes with the important words in boldfaced (with definitions!). She supplements this with a handout before exams detailing what pieces she'll be listen-testing, which words she'll want defined, which text passages she wants you to know, and what essay topic she wants you to write on..
On the other hand, she is so boring that I started counting planes taking off and landing at LaGuardia Airport just to make it through her class. Class periods are a lot of listening, a lot of insight delivered by Rebecca, a lot of questions thrown at the class (most of the time met with dead silence), and a lot of naps.
Her class isn't hard at all. It's just tedious, frustrating, and boring. That's a choice you're going to have to make. If Music Hum is just another GPA-padding requirement you need to get out of the way, take her class. If it's a class you actually want to get something out of, run like hell.

I remember someone making fun of this class (or at least it's name) in the Spec. They obviously never took it, since both the class and Professor Zajac are great. First for the prof- she's very well read and into her stuff. Mickiewicz is prolly her favorite writer, so this is a great class for her to teach. She is very lentient and forgiving of things like not doing readings up to speed, lateness, absence, etc. She treats everyone like the adults we are, and wishes more people would share their ideas in class (not pompous just -for-participation-credit ideas like some people in CC mind you - REAL ideas hehe). Now for the class - Mickiewicz is a great writer of the romanitic period. Outside of Poland and slavic-studies, he is not well known, and it is a shame. He was well-loved and respected by many, like Pushkin, who was his life-time friend. I enjoyed doing the reading for this class, which is a first for me. It is really interesting to see romanticism from a different, more eastern perspective. The link between nationalism/national consciousness and Mickiewicz's works is also really pretty cool to study.

She is really open to meeting  with you to help you on your essays. I met with her several times about my rough drafts any time i was stuck.  She helped me find certain ideas to expand in my paper so that i could make the paper longer. And she's really cool with email. One time, during the weekend before a paper was due on Monday, I had major writer's block and couldn't expand my paper anymore. I just emailed the paper to her and she got back to me quickly with advise. She's also very understanding for writing recommendations. AWESOME TEACHER!!! Really nice! loved her!

Very fair professor. He's really nice. Holds a review sessions and gives last year's exam as a practice exam. Very nice as well. He really likes applying what he teaches to real life, so it's always good to know the current conditions of the economy for any exam. On the final, he made us read two short article on the economy and then asked us essay questions on them.  Go to his office hours and get to know him. He'll remember your name and it matters!! When he knows you and sees that you're a good student, he may grade you in a more lax manner. Overall, good class. The class is much smaller than some intro classes at columbia. I thought this class was much more understandable than the Principles of Econ i took with Brendan O' Flaherty at Columbia.

From what I've heard about other professors, she might be a little tougher in terms of grading and work-load, but please don't let this detract you from taking her class.  She's not a bitter grad student; in fact, she's often commented on how helpful teaching is to her studies.

AWESOME PROFESSOR!!! She gives you a study sheet, practice exam, and review session before every exam. She even comes in on her own time during the weekend for the review session, which is so nice. Her lecture notes are all on courseworks. Also, if you ever cannot make the review sessions, she's also open to seeing you during her office hours for questions. She is awesome! She's damn smart in psyc and she's great at answering questions. Also, she's always so nice and cheerful everyday.  I would definitely recommend this class.

When the other reviewer said that Prof. Magnuson was the prototypical bumbling professor he was not exagerating.  However nice he may be, and he does seem very nice, he is not a good professor by any stretch of the imagination.  His lectures are painful and confusing, and the lab reports are the most boring and lengthy i have ever had to write.  The book is fairly straightforward, although not the most interesting text I've ever read.  Without it you would have no clue what Prof. Magnuson is talking about at all.  If you can take any other class instead of this one, I would definately do so.  I can't imagine anything being worse.  If you have to take this class, do not take the lecture and the lab back to back.  You will regret it.

Overall I really enjoyed Prof.  Woike's class, although i can see why others would have reviewed her negatively.  She is slightly disorganized, she does tend to chew gum rather annoyingly during every class, and she can be downright mean when interacting with certain members of the class.  However, I must say I was rarely bored during her class.  She picks interesting topics, and adds extra information beyond the 300+ pages we had to read per seminar.  Also, she was very considerate with our term paper, requiring several drafts which really helped us to make sure that we had turned in our best possible work.  Also, because you got feedback on TWO drafts before you recieved any grade, you got the highest possible grade based on the work you did.  Overall this class is very interesting and a must for anyone planning on going into a health related industry.  Despite what was said by others, I wound up liking Prof. 
Woike.  She's not a perfect professor but she was FAR from the worst prof ive had a Columbia, and I really enjoyed her class.

LOTS of reading per seminar.  Read enough to comment.  Each person has to write discussion questions for a topic of assigned readings and to lead a discussison.  Everyone also has to choose their own project topic, for which they write a 20 page paper and present the topic to the class for around 40 minutes.  This was the only work all semester that I found actually meaningful as it wasn't just rote memorization or busy work, but actually intended to develop skills, which I think it did.

Some of the topic matter was really interesting. However, on the whole, I couldn't stand this class.  Too many lectures were devoted to too little, and there seemed to be little connection between topics such as developmental bio and speech and IQ testing.  SO SICK of writing little notecards about any questions we had about the lecture, and the writing portfolio is the BIGGEST waste of time.  The extra credit opportunity is good, and will actually teach you something.  I think that might have been the only benefit I got from this class.  All in all, if you want to learn about how children develop, and are uninterested in the bio aspect of it, take Social and Personality Development with Dweck (who is a much more talented lecturer).  Seriously think about this class before you take it, because if you get annoyed easily by professors who treat you like children (or who dote on their own children and use them as case studies WAAAAY too often) this class will just drive you nuts.

Russel is an amazing lecturer. He talks a lot and VERY quickly but the lectures are interesting, interactive, and fun. He has a lot of Barnard pride so if you're CC, GS, or SEAS don't get too offended. My one main criticism is that he manipulates the facts to support his arguments so under no circumstance don't take his lectures as pure fact. He tends to ignore the other side of the argument and it's very easy for him to brainwash you because he seems very knowledgeable. If you would like to argue with him he's approachable after class and makes you think that he's open to other interpretations. While this may be frustrating it is definitly worth it to argue with him. Also discussion section is a good time to discuss what you agree/disagree with. Overall good class but you must investigate all the facts before you make a judgment about anything he tells you.

Where to even begin. On a positive note- the textbook is awesome- it will become your bible over the course of the semester. Poindexter also is a brilliant woman and has been teaching the course for 40 years; however she doesn't necessarily understand that we're not as brilliant and she is and therefore does not know how to convey the material to intro biology students. Just a warning- unless you need this class to satisfy a major requirement- it's not worth the stress. The material is amazing but her lectures are so over your head and you walk out of class being even more confused than you were before lecture.

Non-math and non-science students, be wary.  This class will go completely over your head.  This is not such a tragedy, though - you can still pass this class quite well.  Prof Patterson's lectures are difficult to follow and often sleep-inducing.  Yet, he does give out all of his lecture notes and the textbook is very helpful if you can stand to read it.  Also, his help sessions for problem sets and exams are amazing.  He is a nice man and does not want people to fail.  So, even if you feel lost in class, DO NOT WORRY.  The exams and problem sets, though they seem daunting at first, are very fair.  Find a study/problem set partner to work things out with and you will be fine.  Also, do not be afraid to go to office hours - he loves students who come see him and ask him questions.
Although this was not the best class I've taken, it was not a complete loss, because I did get to bond with a lot of people as we struggled through the problem sets together. Prof Patterson is not a good lecturer, but his quirky sense of humour and friendliness are a definite plus.

While Professor Poindexter's lectures may have been a bit helter-skelter at times she still is a wonderful educator. If you are in a Biology course you cannot simply rely on lecutres for information. Close reading of the text is imperative if you are to get a firm grasp of the material. What I enjoyed most about Prof. Poindexter's lectures was that they were not mere regurgitations of the text, btu extensions of the readings. Also, Prof. Poindexter is extremely approachable and thrives on getting to know her students. If you utilize her office hours you will find that there is a lot more to her personage than just Biology. Also, she is one of those rare professors who accepts queries after class.

This guy is awful. This course is awful. The book is awful.  The TA is horrendous.
The tragedy lies in the fact that this is a required course for IEOR majors and so you will  most probably be stuck with this guy. I will try my best to describe and justify my opinion of this class but let me just say that nothing compares to the actual experience of being in the class. At the most basic level, this class is incredibly inconsistent. Methods/variables used in lecture rarely match up with those in the text book and the recitation is completely useless (other than the fact that it is where you hand in your hw, but don't worry one of your friends can just drop it off for you), as the TA skips dozens of intermediate steps and is barely comprehensible. Also, the ""lectures"" page on Sethuraman's website contains little more than a list of the dates class was held and a vague 1 or 2 word ""description"", so don't let those e-mails about how the ""lectures page was updated"" fool you. That doesn't mean anything. 
And now for the book. My god, what a useless resource. Most of the crucial topics have little in the way of examples and unless you are willing to hit up the Mudd library stacks to find some obscure paper written by Goofus and Gumpus (1971), the book will be of very little help.

This woman has the potential to ruin your entire academic career, and I mean that in all senses of the word ""ruin.""  As a new and young professor (she just finished her PhD) she seems nice and peppy at first.  But it's very clear from the first day that she HEAVILY favors students that she has taught before.  Moreover, after reading her Lit Hum reviews (saying that she skipped 9 out of 11 classes because of her PhD) I found it a little suspicious when she skipped 5 of our classes because she was ""sick.""  And the classes that she did show up at in between her ""sick"" days, she assigned pointless group work where she sat in the front of the class and watched us waste time.  However, I definitely think that the peak of the semester was when she accused me of plagarism after handing in my first paper, because the words I used were ""too big and specific for someone of my age and intelligence to be able to apply.""  Now you're probably wondering what those big words were? Degeneration.  Fragment.  Genre.  In order to vindicate myself, I had to prove to her that these words were a part of my regular vocabulary.  Thiswas not only ridiculous and stressful, but incredibly insulting.  Even after I proved that I didn't plagarize, she still held it against me and lowered the grade on my paper.  Please don't get me wrong, I am not bitching about Elizabeth Weinstock because she gave me a bad grade -- on the contrary I did quite well overall.  But take my advice - she obviously does not think highly of /respect her students if she doesn't believe that people at an Ivy League can apply new concepts and words over 3 syllables to their own ideas.  Either she is completely disillusioned with her own superiority, or she thinks that just because she could never think of such an idea or use such big words when she was a sophomore in college, then no student could do so.  Thus, she is either arrogant or stupid - or maybe both...But the point is, on a whim and without any founded evidence, she threatened my entire academic career.  Don't put yourself through that.  But if you do somehow find your way into her class, make sure not to use any big words, or you could be expelled.

Prof. Legvold is the most intelligent and fair people you will meet at Columbia.  He really takes the philosphy of CC to heart and FOLLOWS it.  While some of his other reviews have said that he favors people, you can tell that he read those reviews and made an effort to change his behavior in class, because now he asks for students to omit thier names on exam booklets and papers so that he can grade them more fairly.  And he does grade fairly.  Class discussions are NEVER boring...seriously.  He stimulates students, he forces students to challenge their beliefs, he knows all of the background and really understands the works.  If you are quiet in class, he will ask your opinion at times, but he does not try to put people on the spot.  He is the epitome of a fair and engaged professor, who really just wants his students to read and understand the material so that they can start forming their own opinions.  What you see is what you get - he is just a great professor.

Greg is a great teacher.  He designed the class in a very unconventional way: there was a choice of readings, so for each class not everyone was reading the same books.  I doubted at first whether this would work out, but it turned out to be great because we brought in so many more angles than would have been possible with a single reading list.  The readings he picked were all great; the title of the class ""Evaluation of Evidence"" is a misnomer, because no individual book is about that; the evaluation comes in comparing the books.  Also, he brings a ton of energy into class, and he creates a really supportive learning environment: no matter how incorrect your comments are, he'll find some element of value in them and bring it out.  He also uses a lot of real-world examples to explain concepts that might be hard to get otherwise.  Really dedicated, incredibly helpful, and fun.  Take any class with him.
I would also disagree with the previous reviewer's comment that going on strike shows a lack of dedication to students.  The afternoon before the strike, I had a long conversation with Greg in which he gave me a ton of help on my final paper.

Literature majors (or even non-lit ones who love to read) who don't take Colloquium on Major Texts (aka Asian Hum) with Lurie to fulfill the MC requirement are shooting themselves in the foot. An assistant professor with possibly the most immaculate goatee known to man, Lurie is phenomenal. True, he doesn't talk much in class and tries to give as little context as possible so that students can discuss their most visceral reactions, but he's funny (he once tried to count the number of orifices in the human body out loud), incredibly smart, and very helpful in office hours. 
The class is a lot of work - it's 4 points and meets once a week, so expect readings on the level of an English or History Department seminar - but there are only two short 5-7 papers and the Famous Asian Hum Oral Final (which is, as everyone says, easier than you think - for half of mine we talked about things totally unrelated to the class). The readings are interesting, for the most part (you read everything from the Tale of Genji to Confucius) and while a lot of them are dense and difficult to relate to, Lurie knows enough to help you through the rough spots.

I took this class for my psych major and I was really happy compared to my friends who took anthropology.  First half of the semester is extremely boring but the reading for the second half of the semester is really interesting! It is easier to read the material before the class- but I never did and I was fine! ( Just try and find a study group- it's easier to study the material that way).

Do not take a class by this professor if at all possible! She makes you read the worst possible texts, and then she goes on and on as if they are the best pieces of literature ever written. When you are writing your essays, she leads you in completely different paths. After one draft, she may tell you to do something, and then after you do that, she says something completely different. Also, if you are a guy it will hurt you, because she gives advantage to flaming liberal girls. On top of all of that, she grades very harshly. Most of my friends who take this class received A-s or As, and I looked at their essays and they weren't anything special. I know kids in my class who received Cs and their essays were much better than those who received As from other professors/TAs. Maybe it is because she just taught English grad students at NYU, and expect that level from us, but I don't know.

I took this class because I'd like to become an architect and the name of the class sounds really cool right? Well it's too bad, because this IS the most boring class. Almost all my friends in this class agreed. No matter how interested you are in civil engineering or architecture, you will dread going to class, and most likely end up skipping it altogether (which most of the class did). Testa could make this class so enjoyable: we could look at slides and learn about the design aspects, and possibly design and build our own stuff. Instead, we do boring physics, test the compression and tension of steel and concrete, and learn about law!! If you are interested in all of that, then by all means take this class, but if you are truly interested in designing stuff, take another preprofessional class.
Also, most preprofessionals curve to around an A- because they are meant to get someone interested in the field and are typically easy. For instance, almost all my friends in different preprofessionals (such as ChemE) got As. However, Testa curves to a B-!!! When I told my friends in the class that, they were flipping out!

Turro is a very boring professor. Most people fall asleep in class, or have learned to just skip it altogether because you learn more by reading the textbook. It is easy to get lost in the classes, and difficult to understand what he's doing because he jumps around very quickly. The midterms come pretty much straight out of the practice exams, so memorize the answers and you'll be fine! However, the final was very difficult, and even if you memorized every single practice question from the entire semester, it will only be good for about 15/75 questions.

One word to describe this professor: WOW!!!! Sunil may quite possibly be the best professor I'll have in my entire Columbia undergraduate experience. I did not like econ at all, and even though I wasn't terribly good at it, he will make you love it! Not forcefully, but he is such a fantastic guy and a wonderful professor. Having a 9 am class is tough, but after a few minutes you're wide awake and enjoying the lecture. After class, feel free to go up to him and talk, he is very fun to chat with. It's also cool because he has a very high position in MLS (major league soccer), and rumor has it he used to play.
The midterm is pretty easy, but the final is very difficult. It is probably the most difficult exam I've ever taken. 23 pages: 40 multiple choice, 12 identification, 12 long answer.

This is especially true if you are struggling with the class.  She simply refuses to clarify any grammar rules or sentence structure in English, even outside of the classroom.

Caleb Scharf is an excellent teacher. The class is cutting edge, so there is no well-developed syllabus for him to follow. He made up his own syllabus and lectures essentially from current research papers. Caleb is a great lecturer and is extremely funny. He tries to distill only the most relevant math and physics from the material so that it is actually providing insight into the material and not complicating it. If you're a math or physics major this kind of lecture style, only putting up relevant physics without derivation, might put you off at first, but once you accept it you realize it really makes your life easier. 
My favorite aspect of the class was the scientific process. Because a lot of the material is new, there is not necessarily an accepted scientific doctrine, so the evidence supporting and rejecting different theories is weighed before your eyes. Compare this to your physics class where there has been a ""correct"" interpretation for at least 80 years. I think the process of scientific discovery is exciting and usually undergrads don't get the chance to see it unfold.

Prof. Helfand is amazing. I never thought I would make it through the science requirement alive, but after a full year of Helfand I am glad to say that science-phobic students have a great option. That being said, this is NOT a class you can totally blow off. It will get hard and frustrating if you do that since there is no textbook to fall back on. But if you go to the lectures, do the problem-sets and go to Helfand during office hours - he is probably the most accessible and friendliest professor I've met at Columbia - by the time the final rolls around you'll be in good shape. one of the few science classes at Columbia where the prof. will bet with his students, perform soliloquy's from Hamlet or run into a wall at full speed, all in the interest of teaching.

I have not taken a poli sci class before, and even for me the concepts sometimes seemed a bit redundant, but on the whole the content of the class is very good.

She is, quite frankly, the most outgoing intelligent professor I have had at Columbia. She is incredibly smart and an excellent writer - you don't win a Pulitzer for book criticism after only two years without talent - and this translates into the classroom fairly well.

One critical thing that Professor Gill must learn when teaching this course is that it is NOT her Philosophy of Education class. While it is appropriate for a professor to expect hard work, preparation, and dedication from her students it is not appropriate for her to expect the same type of performance for Reacting that she might receive in her Philosophy of Ed course. I repeat, Reacting is not a Philosophy course! Professor Gill is very approachable and kind, but her comments can be somewhat off putting at times. She doesn't ever take into account that some students need to be drawn out a bit more from their shyness and is quick to criticize the ""quiet ones"" of the class. This, however, does nothing to encourage students to be more vocal. What prepetually annoyed me was the professor's utopian ideals regarding learning and the fact that one is bound to always feel quite stupid in her presence.  Also, she ought to keep in mind that students have classes other than hers and cannot spend eons in the library researching every tidbit regarding France or India.

In retrospect though I should have just taken the class with another professor and not spent a whole semester waiting to get into Stokes' class. Yes, Professor Stokes is quite a nice woman and the class workload was quite light, but I would have gladly taken a harder course if I could have had a better professor. Professor Stokes seems to take pleasure in her somewhat celebrity status, but didn't fulfill my expectations. In my opinion, she favors those students whom she has had in previous courses and frequently admits them over other students into the class, despite her ""lottery"" policy. Also, her weekend trips to the lake seem to take precedent over her students, so if you have a problem you had better have it addressed by her before Friday afternoon as she does not return to NYC until Monday morning. In addition, Professor Stokes enjoys regaling us with tales of her grand piano and the wealth that she acquired in the advertising business, etc which might offend anyone whose parents make under 100,000 a year. Lastly, the workload is fairly easy but the test and essay questions are at times quite absurd and cause more heaadache than necessary. Professor Stokes is by no means straightforward in her testing. Who wants to spend and entire essay analyzing the personality traits of President Bush or John Kerry, considering that we don't know them personally!?

I don't know about brilliant, but Ferguson is very intelligent and a thoughtful reader. He enjoys 19th century American lit, though, so if you don't, this may not be the class for you. Most of the class is Moby-Dick. It is dense and technical (he notes that it was first classified by librarians under ""Whaling"" and not ""fiction""), but it is interesting and very easy to get into all the technical aspects of the book. The adventure parts come later on and are not a huge portion of the book. I enjoyed _To the Lighthouse_ with Ferguson much more so than I did with my Lit Hum class, though it is still entirely unclear what _To the Lighthouse_ has to do with the deep sea. That is the only real question I have with the overarching themes of the course. They seem to be more about pensiveness, melancholy, equanimity, and other states of being rather than the deep sea.  This is the case also with Eliot's ""The Wasteland,"" which I had read before, but this course offered little insight into. Ferguson did, however, offer much insight into Keats' odes and applied them to Moby Dick, and i think the course was worth taking for that alone.

The other review of Arne is pretty accurate, if not a bit biased because of caring a lot about grades. Arne is a nice enough guy in the lab, willing to show you what to do. He also makes some good explanations sometimes too. The idea of grading this class on a curve is pretty stupid (the other person probably would have been happier too if it wasn't graded like that) because you can have two lab reports of the same quality get different grades if that week's competition was stronger. It also makes the grading seem arbitrary. Unfortunately, Arne doesn't really help the situation by not summarizing what you did well and what you didn't on the lab. He simply puts a percentage and a few check marks. Come on, it's got to be teaching 101 that you need some explanation to why a grade was earned. The labs are a lot of work and you won't learn anything, except how to make some graphs in Excel. I think it's one of the worst required engineering school classes.

I tell you what, do not drink coffee or eat anything in class, she is gonna come over and knock your cup down saying :you cannot eat in lecture! What the. And the TA is stupidly annoying--she flips every slide and adjust and lencese at the same time so everyone stare at the screen is dizzy every time the slides are changed, and she does it all the time deligently!!! If you got good vision, you will definitely have to wear glasses by the time of the final, which I warn you: you will lower your general GPA because of this class: if you got A's in all other architecture/art history classes, you will get a B-/C+ in this one, while the old men get A for some unknown reason. Anyway, if you can choose, do not take this class, for the sake of your GPA and your self-confidence, your eyes and your stomach. Not funny, it is painfully true, just ask everyone else in this class.  My sincere advice after misery and regret for not dropping this class before the deadline is: try to take other professors' classes in the department, RUN AWAY!

The reading list is longer than graduate architecture lectures, about 20+ thick books from last century, many from the rarebook library in the top floor of Butler...if you are only taking less than 3 classes of the whole semester, you might spend most your time strugglling for this one; if you take 5 classes this semester, you'd better really give yourself some liberty and integrity by avoiding this fetal torturing machine!

This class is no longer going to be one of those that you can skip everyday. Dave says he only wants to teach people who are passionate about the subject which was evident this semester on the final. He designed a section that was impossibe to figure out by going to the last few classes and was evident that most people couldn't figure it out because almost everyone went from getting a perfect score down to B's.

Professor Gersten is a good guy but he only has two 30-minute office hours per week, so you've got to get there early if you want to see him.  It is not necessary to attend the class to do well.  Read the book.  Work the problems.  Work the problems again.  This is a self-taught course.  Exams are variants of problems out of the book.

Prof. Herman is certainly a nice guy. And yes, he is funny in a corny kind of way. But that doesn't make him a particularly good teacher. There is way too much material in the ""textbook"" (his typed up notes), and the HWs don't always follow directly from the notes. The tests aren't very enjoyable either, despite being open book. The classes consist of Prof Herman basically going word for word through the notes, interspersed with corny jokes and anecdotes. I did get the impression that he expected you to know things before taking the class, which isn't exactly fair, given that it's an intro class. He also seemed somewhat difficult to get a hold of outside of class; he didn't even have scheduled office hours. Oh, and regardless of how pointless it may seem to go to lectures, don't skip classes: he counts that against your grade. The material itself can be fairly interesting; it's just not presented in the best way. If you really like physics, and don't mind trying to teach yourself things, I guess you'd probably love this class.

Breaking the pattern here, I guess: I didn't have him for ODE.
Anyway, he seems a nice enough guy, if a little distant. I had no trouble at all with his accent, so I don't understand where those comments are coming from. The class itself sometimes moves very slowly, and somehow it's HARDER because there are only two chapters covered in the entire class. I could be wrong, but the impression I got was that he's a fair grader on tests and a killer on the weekly quizzes. The quizzes only count for 10% of your grade, so they're not such a big deal (and apparently very few people do well on them anyway). The tests were fair overall, and I got the grade I expected. I have heard from people in my ODE tutoring that Krichever's ODE class is hard and that he likes to focus on physics problems. Either way, his IVA class is relatively straightforward. No surprises.

Taken Spring 2004: Gallagher is a great professor as the other reviews have said, but he is getting older, so he's referring to his notes more frequently and will be slower to grade things- he returned our second midterm which was taken on March 31 on the last day of classes May 3.

Far and away, the most spiteful and petty professor I have ever met.  If you want to get an A in this class, be sure never to let Prof. Raphaeli know.  In my opinion, she has no problem disregarding the average of your test scores, your homework scores, your class participation and attendance to make sure you do not get the grade you deserve and want.  She seems like a nice old lady until you question her grading system (a 99 can sometimes be recorded as an A- in her class!).   And watch out - she never gives partial credit for test questions and always makes sure that the distribution on a test comes out so that one mistake will result in an A-.  
In terms of her actual teaching skills, she's decent.  The article segments that she gives to the class are helpful and generally illustrate the way the verbs we learn are used in modern Hebrew discourse.

Katja Vogt is a goddess. I think the previous review, with all due respects, provides a simplified view of this professor. While it is true that she is an easy grader and that she has no interest to instigate dynamic discussion, she is above all an extremely passionate thinker with a true commitment to teaching the books. She is rather young in her deparment and hence she questions a lot of established ideas that have formed around the books. 
Essentially, she gives what she receives.. In days when the class had obviously read the material she was passionate and brilliantly elucidated the texts, during some lessons when nobody  had done the reading she tried to focus on what everybody read to avoid embarassing us. She is very shy, but also very approachable through e-mail and office hours.

Larry Engel is a professor with great potential who somehow insists on being boring. He doesn't really ""teach"" so much as he projects movies and draws out a cliche' or two before and after the films, drawn straight out of the readings. However, in the one or two instances when he does analyze a scene he has his moments of brilliance - unfortunately, these moments were rare. 
The class is not hard, the reading is vastly doable, and sitting in a room every week watching movies (most of which are great, except for his odd choice of the bride of frankenstein) can barely be considered a torture. Even if you are taking the class for kicks and do not intend to be a film major, you can easily both have fun and get an A. 
The man has an obsession with Alain Resnais. When I took his class, he used three Alain Resnais movies as the ""main movie"" for the French New Wave class, the Experimentalist/Avantguard film class and the Documentary Class. While Resnais is a highly eminent director, his work can hardly be considered ""emblematic"" for each of those three movements/traditions ... so at the end of the semester, do yourself a favour and watch more films to get a broader picture of the New Wave and Experimentalist film.

I completely agree with the previous several reviews. Professor Tuts' lectures dumb down the information but are often very roundabout and cursory. Most of the material he covers in class is explained in a much more precise and presentable manner in the book. Instead, he needs to spend class times working on problems and applying the concepts to situations. On the rare occasions he does do examples, you go back to your book and find that they are already explained there. His problem sets are very selective - they start with a few easy problems in basic concepts but jump suddenly to challenge problems requiring a deep understanding of all the concepts, which can only be obtained (i think) if you do every problem in the book. Go to his study sessions and you'll see that only his grad student TAs are able to do them. You often need to know some key equation outside the scope of the class, and be able to make those connections. 
His tests are very hard - going to lectures, doing problem sets is not enough. He seems very comfortable with the fact that the mean is usually around 50, a B. Sure, do everything and you'll be guaranteed a B- or higher, but I worked very hard in this class and did not feel like all my effort was worthwhile. In the end, you just feel stupid, but Tuts pitied you and gave you a decent grade to make it all better. Yet, if he had done a better job teaching, going over the material he was going to test, maybe our class mean would be higher and we'd feel better about the grade we got. Sure, I'm a premed, but I'd rather get a C and learn the material well, then get raped by the tests and pull off a B+. What a crappy class.

The lectures on Dubliners and Portrait do a good job of situating the major themes of Joyce's career which get played out in Exiles and Ulysses. Seidel really humanizes Joyce's genius so that you can see a lot of yourself in him (and also a lot of his eccentricities that you hope not to see in yourself). The lectures on Ulysses are really the highlight of the course as they make one of the hardest books ever written seem unbelievably manageable. Seidel is an able guide who even teaches other teaches how to teach Ulysses. Seidel rarely gets lost in minute details, and if he does, it is usually because Joyce got lost in them too and they show you how his mind works. For having taught this course so many times, however, Seidel didn't time it well, and the last few lectures were unfortunately rushed and  the course was left without a sense of closure. Seidel also sometimes focuses too much on Joyce the man and writer, and less on Joyce the thinker, and so rarely are the grand philosophical themes in Joyce discussed. But, for an intro class, maybe this is all the better.

Tries hard to make class interesting, but the course covers so much material at such a fast pace that she ends up just throwing up equations on the board which only make sense to you when she explains it.

He's not a very good teacher, although he does try hard. The notes that he gives in class are somewhat useful, although the book gives about the same type of examples and a decent explanation. Unfortunately, he's really boring and there's little incentive to pay attention in class. The exams are much much harder than the practice tests and the hw. If you go to office hours you can usually get great help and in depth explanation, but lectures can pretty much be skipped if you're willing to study from the book.

Professor Magnuson certainly tried hard to make his class accessible (master web site for all relevant info, available powerpoint lectures), but this is a course that's desperately in need of a subject. There's no theory to be learned, just a whole semester devoted to lab technique, experimental construct, and other topics that are usually found within the first two chapters of any real science textbook. And the time devoted to statistics was simply insult to injury - psych majors already have a stat. requirement! Two of the three labs were devoted to language and memory, Prof. Magnuson's specialty, but he didn't take the time to teach any of the theory behind them. Thus, writing the lab reports was about as fun as chewing broken glass. I don't blame Professor Magnuson, he certainly tried hard, but someone needs to inject substance into this course if it has any hope of survival.

I think you *can* get a lot out of this course if you decide to, but there are a few things you should know about Kat.  Her combinations are good for your technique and often fun and challenging, but I know students who don't think they benefitted much from studying with her because she's kind of quirky. She's a little socially awkward, calls attention to you if you're thirty seconds late to class (even though this class always runs five minutes over), and has a tendency to interrupt you at the barre to give you corrections, messing up the combination for you. That said, if you get along with her, she gives a good class. You'll walk out of the studio dripping with sweat, but your petit allegro will improve.

I took this course because this professor has received so many wonderful reviews. I was extremely disappointed with the class and the professor. If you have ANY knowledge of math in the slightest, this class is slow, boring, and you often feel like you know more than the professor. She is extremely disorganized in her notes and often admitted that she explained concepts wrong, She depended on the answer key to go over the workbook problems, and seemed to have no idea of how to explain the material in another way. I hated going to class more than anything, and luckily, the class is geared so you can miss class, not do the work, and still get an A. I left the class with an A, but with no real understanding of statistics, because the exams were handed to you with all equations and all you had to do was put it in your calculator. If you want a brainless A, this class is for you, but if you have any desire to actually learn, take it from another professor.

seneca once wrote, 'i think there is no one who has rendered worse service to the human race than those who have learned philosophy as a mercenary trade.' a merceneary trade is a rather apt of describing how mark c. taylor teaches philosophy. for taylor, philosophy is a battleground of abstract concepts and the victor is he who can master those concepts and use them as weapons of uselessness. as his student, you will be expected to do the same. taylor's attempts to make this philosophy accountable to everyday life are laughable. to think of taylor as opening your mind to new philosophical ideas is to buy into his fractured system where what you think doesn't matter at all to who you are. taylor is the personification of the hopelessly abstract academic philosopher who snatches on to new vogue ideas in order to write about them and market them as a mercenary, not as a human being. (note the fashionable trajectory of his career and his entrepeneurial pursuits in the world of making education into a marketable business.)  taylor's vision of philosophy learns nothing from the texts he supposedly knows so much about. as the other reviewer noted, asking what derrida means means that you haven't really read derrida on his own terms. it means you never learned how to teach; it means that philosophy means nothing to you except as a way to get famous. so don't take taylor's class because he is so smart or because he has such great readings of texts. he cannot be a great philosopher because he does not understand philosophy as a way of life, not just a system of abstractions. if you decide to study with him because the syllabus is just too attractive to pass up or because your intrigued by the hype, by all means resist. refuse to buy into the poverty of philosophy that taylor so well represents. grill him as he grills you in class. as much as i dislike the man's views on philosophy, he will respect you for sticking up for yourself and arguing your position. the fact that i have spent so much energy ranting about him does show he can excite energy. but be braver than i was. don't just vent in a culpa review. even if you don't know as much about the texts, hopefully you know more about being human, and hopefully you can make this class a more pleasant enviorenment than it was for most of us in fall 2003.

Couch is neither the best nor the worst. All in all, he is OK or better. I think the editions he made to the syllabus were very appropriate in stimulating thematic comparisons, and most of the time the readings are manageable. He is also a fair grader, though sometimes I think he spends no more than 5 minutes on the grading. One big complaint: he really needs to work on discussion in class. Most of the time about 2 or 3 people DOMINATED the class, and he was unable to put them in their place.

If you are going to take the 2nd semester of organic chemistry, take it with Professor Leighton. He is a very straightforward lecturer, and his sort of intense clarity may make him seem a little cold, but he turns out to be a very nice guy as well as a good teacher. A lot of material is covered in this class, but Professor Leighton gets through everything, and makes it all as simple as it can be. He is definitely helpful in office hours (as are the TAs), and like the other reviewers say, he is interested in helping you, not in failing you. His test questions can be a little tricky, but they are fair. Professor Leighton seems to know everythign there is to know about the subject, and he expresses his knowledge extremely well. He is always very prepared, which makes him easier to follow. After taking organic chemistry II with him, I wouldn't want to take it with anyone else.

Sra. Golston is an extremely nice woman. She is dedicated to helping her students improve their spanish. She is more than happy to meet with students during office hours, etc. My only complaint about her is her seeming lack of preparation. Sometimes she seemed a little lost in class, so she told us to just kind of talk (in spanish) amongst ourselves. It's possible that I mis-read these situations; maybe this was really how she wanted to run this kind of strange conversation class. I also felt like she could have encouraged a little more conversation and a little less reading out of the (bad) textbook. All in all, she did a pretty good job teaching a class that any spanish-speaking person could teach. In fact, she is probably over-qualified to teach this class. In general, I would recommend her, as she is extremely kind, and clearly cares about her students. 
Workload:
VERY light. This class was extremely easy, especially compared to upper-level spanish literature classes that many people in the class have previously taken. The homework assignments were usually to read stories that are like 2 pages long. These stories were then discussed in class. There were no written assignments at all. Grades were based on participation, attendance, and 2 oral presentations (first one about 10 min, second one about 15 min). The presentations were graded a little more harshly than I thought they might be, but good class participation will make up for that. Sra. Golston planned on having a final oral exam, but decided to use the second presentation as the ""final"" instead. You probably won't find a much easier class at Columbia!

As the other reviews say, Professor Rosenthal is a very good Lit Hum teacher. It's also pretty neat to have the former Associate Dean of Columbia College and current head of the english department as your Lit Hum teacher. I don't know if he was quite as fantastic as some of the reviews make him out to be, but maybe that's just because I don't love Lit Hum in general. In short, I doubt there are many lit hum teachers who are better than him. Like another reviewer said, he could be described as an ""old school"" professor, but to me, that is sort of the perfect description of a Lit Hum teacher, because Lit Hum is an ""old school"" course. He clearly knows everything about the books on the syllabus, and he loves each one. However, he doesn't force the students to love these books--he just asks them to read them seriously and critically, and be ready to discuss. His dry humor brings a certain lightness to the class, which is certainly a good thing. My one main complaint would be that he lectured a little too much for my taste. I shouldn't really complain, though, because what he said in his mini-lectures was usually helpful to understanding the book, but as another reviewer said, he was also attempting (although he wouldn't want to admit it) to make the students agree with his interpretations of the texts. When he wasn't lecturing, though, he moved the discussions along well, often focusing on the most obviously important parts of the book (which is a good thing, in my opinion). He is an extremely nice man, who desperately wants to interact with students outside of class (he has a ton of office hours, and he invited our whole class to a party at his beautiful apartment at the end of the year). So, if you're placed into Professor Rosenthal's class, be happy, because most of your friends will end up with teachers that have many more flaws than he does! And, if you can, try to take advantage of his great knowledge while appreciating his self-depricating humor.

Probably a little more than most other lit hum classes, because of his extra readings. He thinks that as long as we are taking Lit Hum, we might as well read as many ""great books"" as possible. He gives the standard number of essays per semester (2 or 3), but they are graded pretty harshly. Remember, he is the former associate dean of Columbia College, and is the head of the english department, so he is serious about writing, etc. His midterm is just passage IDs, and he of course uses the standard final. His test-grading is sort of mysterious, as he has a curve which he claims makes sure that everyone does well (basically, I think, the highest score is given an A, and then it goes down from there). Not terrible, but not easy overall.

I liked Professor Yemini a lot, and I feel like I learned a lot in his class. He clearly has a great depth of knowledge in the field, his digressions are good, and he's very personable and approachable.
Some things to be prepared for, though:
* His lecturing style is very dry, delivered in a low rumble. I was really interested in the material and was able to look past this to some extent, but it was sometimes hard to keep my mind from wandering. It also meant that much of the class wasn't all that strongly engaged, which de-energized the room.
* The lectures were fairly applicable to the exams, but weren't all that helpful for the homework assignments. This, in combination with their dryness, plus the online availibility of lecture notes, is probably what caused most of the class to stop going to lecture starting about 1/3 of the way through the semester. This de-energized the classroom further.
* Professor Yemini tries to make the initial assignments harder and the assignments later in the semester easier; his feeling is most C.S. classes operate in the opposite manner, and it's nice to counterbalance that. This isn't a bad philosophy.
* There's a definite effort to make the homework assignments and the exam questions non-cliched and interesting. The results of this are a bit hit-and-miss, though. In the first programming assignment, for example, it was very difficult to divine what the project was supposed to do based on the specification. Others in the class spent hours upon hours spinning their wheels until they understood; I settled for a lower grade on that assignment. The second programming assignment, an RMI MUD server (with a reasonably constrained world-state to keep track of), in contrast, was a lot more fun.
Workload:
2 programming assignments, 3-4 non-programming assignments, an open-book, open-notes midterm, and a similarly open final. The midterm in particular it's best to study for as if the exam isn't open-book, though, as you won't have much time to look things up.

Professor Kaiser's lectures are generally quite well done. She uses lots and lots of powerpoint slides, which isn't generally my favorite approach -- I like it when lecturers use fewer slides, or just chalk and chalkboard if they can get away with it -- but she pulls it off pretty well.
The class organization is quite strong, particularly with regard to the major assignments (paper and project, both of which include several milestones to meet aside from the final submission.) The work required and assignment specs were all laid out pretty clearly at the beginning of the semester, which was really refreshing, actually. Most of the other C.S. classes I've been in don't make specifications for assignments available until 1-3 weeks before they come due; it's hard to plan a semester that way.
I'd say the course is intended to give a flavor of how web technology is used and how it developed -- up to and including the state of the art -- and it works well in that regard. A lot of information goes by quite fast, especially by the end, but students don't have to do all that much with lectures that don't relate to their project and paper, as there aren't exams.

Prof. Lotringer is obviously an extremely intelligent man, with worthwhile things to say.  Unfortunately, this class did not showcase those features particularly well.  I had the impression early on in the semester (when I was keeping up with all the reading) that my class and I were a constant disappointment to Prof. Lotringer, b/c we had not kept up with obscure French literary criticisms of the past 100+ years, nor random French novels from all centuries.  Being thus disappointed, he then proceeded to rarely ask for any input or discussion.  The class lacked any direction or focus.  We spent probably half a semester on Madame Bovary, leaving the rest for the roughly 7 other books he had planned.  In general, I feel if Prof. Lotringer had given us some idea of what we were supposed to be getting out of the class, and what he expected from us, the class could have been greatly improved.
Workload:
About 8 books, but since he expects no class discussion and there is no midterm or final, it is possible not to do all of them.  One short paper (about 5 pages) and one long final paper (12-15 pages).  It is EXTREMELY difficult to write the papers, because Prof. Lotringer gives no hint of what he is looking for.

Britain since 1987 is by far the most challenging and rewarding class I've taken at Columbia in my three years here.  I walked into class not knowing a thing about British history and walked out with a good grasp on the happenings of this time period.  Susan Pedersen is new at Columbia, but you wouldn't know that if she didn't tell you.  She did amazing work at Harvard (google her) and the CU history department is very lucky to have snatched her.  She teaches history from three frameworks: the political, economic and social/cultural.  Her strongest point is by far the political aspect.  She knows party politics like it's no one else's business.  Her lectures are comprehensive, organized and always on-topic.  She is also an excellent lecturer.   Don't worry if you know nothing about British history.  You'll learn if you don't mind hard work.  There is a substantial amount of reading from primary sources to secondary texts.   Read them.  If you don't, it'll come back and bite you in the ass come end of semester.  There are also mandatory film viewings.  Section (if run well, which mine was) is extremely helpful; I would highly recommend you attend on a regular basis.   Pedersen is also highly accessible to her students; she will do anything she can to help you out.  I love Susan Pedersen.  If you like the way Mark Carnes (one of my all-time favorite professors), you will adore Susan Pedersen.  They both teach history with passion and a desire for recounting not only the narrative, but telling it in such a way as to challenge your own ways of thinking about the happenings of that time.

Lean is not one of the best history professors I've had at Columbia, but she's certainly not the worst.  I took this class because I wanted to learn modern Chinese history and at the end, I did, but probably not to the extent I wanted to learn it.  I agree with one of the reviewers in that Lean does lecture verbatim off Spence's ""Search for Modern China"" textbook.  That's not to say she doesn't know her material, because believe me, she does.  The way she lectures is a bit frustrating; when not talking about gender (her specialization) she sort of fumbles and is repetitive.   This is probably due to the fact that she's a fairly new lecturer; she'll get better with time.  You're almost better off reading that text.  The readings are selective and very well chosen.  There is a lot of it, although you don't HAVE to read it as her exams are lecture-based.  TAs do the grading, but grading is on the rough side.  The exam questions are difficult and abstract and require to really think and form a convincing answer.   Overall, Lean is intelligent, extremely well-read  (not just in Chinese history) and responsive to questions in class.  And even though she doesn't convey that she expects a LOT out of you, she does, as evidenced by her harsh grading standards.

WARNING: The reviews below largely ignore the fact that Sidorsky is probably not a good teacher for someone who has a serious interest in philosophy.  In Moral Philosophy we covered a grand total of 7 papers (in the form of interpreted excerpts from the textbook), which were each boiled down to about 4 or so very basic points.  Furthermore, the only meta-ethical paradigm covered was naturalism (how do you teach an moral philosophy class without even mentioning consequentialism?).  Sidorsky barely touched on problems with the Authors' systems -- if you like to read philosophy critically, it will be largely impossible for you to stay focused on the lectures for more than 20 minutes.  Moral Philosophy V3701, as far as the lectures are concerned, was largely a philosophy-qua-literature class in which memorization of the absolute basics of the authorsÂ’ ideas was the primary focus instead of using the ideas as a vehicle for coming to a deeper understanding of morality.  The upside is I guess that youÂ’ll be able to say a few sentences about the historical context of these authors and their most basic points if their names ever come up at the dinner table.   Oddly, however, the excessively long exams ask you to evaluate the authorsÂ’ ideas over and over and over again until you canÂ’t feel your fingers gripping your pen.  Overall, itÂ’s a cinch to get a B, but pretty tough to get an A as its difficult to know what heÂ’s looking for.  In conclusion: this class is not for philosophy majors.   I repeat: this class is not for philosophy majors.  Did I mention that itÂ’s not for philosophy majors?  Annoyed?  Just wanted to point out that itÂ’s not for people who canÂ’t stand repetition (and not really learning much for your tuition).

This was probably the most useless class I've taken in college, and the most disappointing. It could have considered the battles between evolutionists and creationists, or the damage that descending from monkeys may or may not do to humans' pride of place, or whatever. Instead, the class was more or less Professor Bock defending evolutionary biology and his own work from Karl Popper and anyone else who says it's not a real science. He delivered essentially the same lecture every week and dredged up the same examples over and over again (turkey vultures aren't real vultures!). I stuck with the class until after the drop date because I kept hoping something would change and, I'll admit, because I was tempted by the idea of a 4 point class whose entire workload is 15 pages of writing. At least the reading, especially Mayr's books, is generally interesting. It doesn't really matter if you do it though, since Prof. Bock barely seemed to read the midterm paper. I got about 20 words of comments on mine, and everyone got some variety of B. The final paper was officially more ambitious but blatantly asked you to repeat what he had said over the course of the term, to the point where more than half of the papers he assigned to read before writing it were by him and on the same topics as the paper. All in all a very weak class.

So much of what sparks visual arts basic courses has to do with the dynamics of the students.  Whether  your class starts off a little shy and dry or stupid and silent or bright and talented in critiques, it will likely end that way and so the class sufferability in one sense will depend on you. Still, crits are fostered or smothered by the class response to the professor, in Coopers case, a stupid, snippy woman who simply does not, in my opinion, know how to run a succesful drawing class or create a productive atmosphere.  You may improve basic technique by the mere fact of practice, but if you're serious about art, skip out- you'll be stifled by the ridiculously boring and unconstructive critiques and stunted by the lack of exposure to a sophisticated intellectual artistic sensibility.

There is a cult of students who worship Vandenburg, and after taking her course I know why. The woman is brilliant, funny, understanding, and very approachable.

Arguably the most lackluster TA you will ever have in a university setting. This class was the worst experience I have ever had. Erica's lackadaisical instruction matched well with her curt, obnoxious personality, making her totally unapproachable as an instructor.
Classes consisted of 25-30 minutes of ""conversation"" to which she never payed attention, very vague overviews of grammar, and nothing else. She murmured for the majority of the class and gave unintelligible answers to student questions for the other part. 
THEN she decided that she was entitled to benefits for the ""labor"" of her instruction and stopped holding class altogether. Her four week hiatus from the vacation that  was her class time only  agitated the antagonistic relationship between herself and the students that she had been building since the beginning of the semester.

Having little to no background in the type of material here, I was fairly anxious about taking this class, but Cristoph does a very good job of presenting the material in a concise manner.  The classes almost solely consist of him lecturing with a Powerpoint presentation, but he'll crack a joke here or there and even give 3-minute breaks in a 75 minute class(!) to break it up a bit.
The material itself is fascinating ... it is heavily biological and mostly deals with the workings of the nervous system, acting as an effective counterpoint to other psychology classes I have taken.
Don't bother even buying the textbook ... tests are completely based on the material presented in class, but do require a lot of memorization and sometimes ask irritating questions about the most trivial details, so they expect you to know just about everything.  However, being able to print out the slides and take notes on them makes studying much easier.  I definitely recommend this course.

Physics in Columbia is not easy, but it's easy to get a good grade if you take with Professor Tuts.

There is no point of going to the class because you would not learn how to solve the problem. I would rather prefer him doing more problem solving than repeating the textbook.

Klein is a nice, reasonable professor, but he is extremely repetitious in his lectures and constantly runs late.  If you have a good deal of patience and are interested in Byzantine art, then you are ready for this class.  Please note that this class has a discussion section, in which you regurgitate what has already been said by Klein in class.   For that reason alone, his class is worth avoiding.  He takes attendance for the sections seriously--if you miss one, you have to write a one page summary of the weekly reading.  I kid you not.

The nice thing about Augustyn is that she's been at Columbia since undergrad, and so she's reasonable about the workload, etc.  She is also generous in her grading. However, I often either did not follow or disagreed with some of her interpretations--granted she is a professor, but others in the class agreed with me too.  She does not manage her time very well; I know it's hard to squeeze in so many books, but oftentimes you only end up discussing the first section of any given book.

Jack might come off as a nice guy in the beginning of the class but watch out for him!! First off, he has made gateway into a huge train wreck to which he keeps adding more victims. Every time I tell an upperclassman or recent graduate what we have to do in gateway they are shocked seeing as the class was so much easier before. Gateway is simply a pain....a few words of advice before you take the class: on the questionaire where they ask you about your skills....LIE, say you know nothing or else you will be stuck doing everything in the group project. Second of all, dont try too hard, there is absolutely no reason to!! The marks that really count such as participation, final presentation, midterm and final PTV are all graded extremely subjectively yet you will get a decent mark even if you dont do your best. I personally worked my ass off in the community project, was team leader and really pushed my team and we did very well. Yet jack still screwed me over and gave me an A-! Oh and he will probably boast how this is a four point class as opposed to a 3pt class. However, that is all bullshit! the workload is so much that it deserves more than 4 points and it just gives him more of a hand in determining your fate seeing as the grade u get counts for more. As for jack as a professor.....he created this ""lecture"" for gateway ontop of the lab not too long ago where he just drones on for more than an hour...not to mention it was a 9 AM class! Some of the things he says are entertaining but are not really educational. The class is simply designed for him to try to instill in everyone some sort of ""teamwork skills"" but it fails miserabely....you will NEVER use anything he says in class, even in your community project! Word of advice: skip class and have someone sign you in a few times, you wont be missing out on anything....but go to the last lecture, its nice. Bottom line, Jack is unfair, he's full of himslef, and he makes believe he knows what the students want....when he clearly does not. However, he could be nice, just make sure to suck up to him alot, he is flattered very easily and likes it if u try to be his friend (I know sounds like highschool to me).

But if you dont know chem that well you ceratinly dont have time to do all the studying required to get a good grade in this class.

You can get a much better grade with much less work in another section, though u might learn a bit less chem and alot less about plumbing.

Niels is a gem of a professor: he teaches you the piano according to what you want from the course, all the while the both of you sharing your philosophies and interpretations of music and how you see it intermingled with art in life. Not to sound too technical though, it is with great pleasure that I anticipate going to my piano classes with Niels. This class has served as a smooth balance to an otherwise heavy academic and active social life at Columbia. My only regret is that as a non-music major, I cannot take a  full hour of class. I highly recommend Niels as a piano professor. He is attentive, and he may likely inspire you to discover pleasure in music that you may not have experienced before.

Kim is a boring lecturer, by the middle of the semester you had around 30 people out of around 150 actually showing up to class (yes, i counted, i told you he's boring). His english isnt good, but its understandable, though it does get confusing sometimes when he mispronounces terms. Kim will simply put u to sleep. his demonstrations NEVER EVER worked and i mean NEVER, he might have gotten a simple one to work once, but that pretty much puts him at like a 2% success rate. Just like 1401, the material goes by way too quickly and you'll only do well if you already know it. Plus you have ppl dropping down from 1600 along with people who took AP physics who all mess up the curve! So if you dont know any physics like me and this is truely your intro to it (like me)...may God have mercy on your soul! Bottom line, all intro physics profs at columbia suck, kim might suck a bit less than others and apparently his exams are easier (though i didnt' notice a difference).

Lit Hum was one of my favorite classes all year - and let me tell you, it wasn't because of the course material, but because of Golston. He is no meek professor. Like the other reviewers have already noted, Prof. Golston has a flair for the dramatic. He does voices, acts out scenes from the readings, and basically just makes class extremely interesting. Because he raises wonderful thought-provoking questions during the disucssions, most of the class time was spent learning about the history behind particular novels and plays. Most of the information I remember from the class deals with the myriad of off-topic discussions he mediated, such as why English has more words than other languages. He knows that the departmental lit hum final is pretty much BS, so he spends most of the time talking about other related subjects. That being said, you will have absolutely no difficulty with the final.
Also - Professor Golston teaches the Bible extremely well. He spends about a month on the readings and poses wonderfully exciting and interesting questions to the class.
To summarize, I loved this class.

What an amazing class. Professor Engel, by far, taught the best class I had all year. Provided, I am a film major, but I think my love for the class stands far beyond my love of film. Essentially, Larry is extremely passionate about cinema and it shows during the screenings. Although he does talk over the films, he chooses times with very little action and usually adds quite a bit to the impact of the film. From day one, Larry hopes that he'll change the way you see film and I can faithfully say that by the last class, he certainly accomplishes that goal.
As other reviewers have stated, it's the TAs and not Prof. Engel that grades your work, so getting a bad TA can be deadly - then again that can happen in your other classes as well. If you're not interested in majoring in film, then just Pass-Fail the class - if you are, then just be sure to follow up with your TA and let him or her know about your interest in cinema.
Going to class every day was a pleasure unmatched by the rest of my schedule.

Let me start off by saying that due to schedule conflicts, I had to take this class at 9am and I am not what you'd call a ""morning person"". That being said, I thought this class was okay. His lecturing style is a little boring, but I'd be lying if I said that he didn't cover all of the material because Professor Dutta thoroughly goes over every bit of every chapter. Most of the time, I didn't have to read chapters to answer the problem set because he gave me all of the information I needed in class. If you show up to the lectures, you'll definitely be fine for the exams.
His problem sets consist of 4 - 5 problems in the book that are usually extremely easy to answer. This means two things: 1. Easy A+ for the homework grade 2. You don't really learn as much as the other micro class. He definitely repeats some of the stuff you learned in Principles and doesn't go in-depth at all. This is definitely something to consider, especially if you're going to be an economics major. I had O'Flaherty last term for Principles and I am extremely scared to take Econometrics and Macroeconomics next year due to my poor foundation of econ knowledge. Then again, this was his first time teaching Micro in a long time, so he could get better.

George is great!  He really cares a lot about you learning to fence properly and he will work with you individually if you need help.  He also tells you about the history behind fencing, which is actually pretty interesting.  Through the whole thing he is very funny--not laugh-out-loud funny, but joking around in a more mellow way.  Class somehow managed to be casual and structured at the same time.  I may not have gotten that good at fencing, but I learned a lot anyway while having fun at the same time.

Although I loved getting credit for reading beautiful poems, the class itself was a struggle. MW at 9:10 am (and he was often late)?? Mendelsohn goes to the front of the room, makes some weird random introduction to the day's lecture (usually by some off the wall analogy like the vegan macrobiotic restaurant one), and then proceeds to meander around for 1:15 about God knows what....? A recurring complaint was that he doesn't focus on any overarching themes, but merely goes line-by-line through selected poems, which besides being boring, does nothing to help you understand the poet's ideas or themes- therefore I had a hard time having anything to use in the paper, or having any information to use when reading non-microanalyzed poems. Also, he tells people to sit up straight and pay attention (at 9 am!! in a 100 person lecture!) He is a nice guy, but the lectures are painful. He reminded us he was tired every day and that he hadn't prepared a lecture - which I don't particularly mind, but we shouldn't be able to TELL that you don't have anything cohesive to say!!

I really liked this class. Rebecca is a sweet, if very flustered, lady, and the books we read were very enjoyable and well-picked. The lectures could be either painfully tangential and circuitous, or really fun and inspiring. It depended on what book we were discussing and the weather, I suppose. One of my fave parts was listening to what my classmates had to say, actually - everyone in this class is a pretty incisive reader, and a most-likely a Russian - some interesting perspectives. Rebecca is a hard grader but for some reason I came out alright. She doesn't hand out A's for nothing.

I think there's a reason for the lack of reviews on Dr. Hua.  She is an incredibly nice person but not necessarily the greatest professor.  If you are a neuroscience major at Barnard, you cannot avoid taking Neurobiology and it looks like Dr. Hua's going to be teaching it for a while.  
The good news?  She is incredibly warm, friendly and understanding and if you go to her office hours she is willing to teach and explain the material over and over again.  She is very patient, never patronizing, and truly cares about the success of her students.  She is much more skilled in explaining concepts on a one to one basis as opposed to lecturing in class.  
The bad news?  She is not the greatest or most organized lecturer.  She additionally has an accent that may take time getting used to and understanding.  However, I overall found the material to be fascinating.  It can be overwhelming and intimidating but its Neurobiology!  What did you expect? 
Recommendations?  Spend a little bit of time with the material each day and go to Dr. Hua's office hours or make an appointment with her the moment you realize you don't understand a concept.  Go see her even if you think you DO understand a concept.  Knowledge in the class tends to build so missing what seems like a small idea may be disastrous in the long run.  Dr. Hua uses PowerPoint slides during lecture and has handouts of her notes in outline form.  I never found these to be too useful and rewrote these using supplementary information from any notes I took in class and from the textbook (which is quite horrible and I would recommend checking out the Kandel Neuro book for clarification on certain concepts).  I also found reviewing for exams in a group to be very helpful.  
And because I don't feel like writing a separate review, here's a little something about the lab in Neurobiology, also taught by Dr. Hua - fantastic!  It's really really long and takes up an entire afternoon once a week but the length of the class actually made it more relaxed and she doesn't mind if you take small breaks here and there.  It was one of the most fascinating lab courses I've ever taken.  Microdissections, electrodes, crayfish!  What could be better?  The manual can definitely be improved and there are mostly full lab write ups (which take a long time) but I really enjoyed the class.       
Workload:
Lecture: three exams and a final?  Two exams and a final?  I forget.  Overall, a lot of work to study for them but they are fairly reasonable exams.

After three years at Columbia, I have not been more disappointed by a course or by an instructor. Like most, I was seduced by Mundell's credentials into taking the course. But, somewhat ironically, his course was more like a high school class than any other I have had at columbia. He uses no lecture notes, which guarantees that his lectures will be meandering and disorganized, and he repeats himself endlessly. Further you do not go into any of the ""topics"" in depth at all. Mundell does nothing to challenge his students - he belabors simple points that you learned in principles of economics, or worse, in high school. His tests require spitting out stupid catch-phrases. The course as a whole is disgustingly unstimulating and offers no insight into economics AT ALL. My advice: DON'T TAKE THIS COURSE! Instead, go to his website www.robertmundell.net and read through his international economics text papers - they are wonderful. You won't get anything more out of the course.

Flynn is a very approachable and amiable old man, but this class certainly isn't the most freshman friendly. You can tell he has a lot to juggle on his plate, being a big name and all, and this class is sort of a side job that has been conditioned to banality over the years. Go to his office hours frequently, and he may remember your name. Go to him a few weeks after the class ends to ask for a recommendation letter, and he's forgotten about you completely. He's willing to write them, but they must be cookie cutter, fill in student's name here recommendation letters...he's the guy who looks you straight in the eye, offers good advice, but couldn't care less about who you are and where you are going. 
His class is good though, and you learn a lot. It is actually an introduction to physical chemistry, so it uses a lot of physics concepts and requries some math. For the pre-meds out there, if you have a solid foundation in general chemistry, this is a very fun class.

Based on previous reviews of professor and class, I think many students entered this course thinking that Massad would argue point by point why Palestinians are glorious and Israelis are monsters.   This wasn't the case at all - Massad took extraordinary care to critically examine each of the events that led to the current conflict and never offered a diatribe on how we should think.  Massad always presented facts, never opinion; those facts in turn were supported by the enormous amount of research assigned to us for our weekly readings.  Much of the research, which indeed is supported and accepted across much of academia, potentially contradicts positions that support much of Israeli government policy - this rankled quite a few auditors in the class - auditors who argued their opinions (unlike Massad) clearly without having completed the assigned reading, thus delaying, not enlightening, the class.  Prof. Massad never belittled any student for his/her opinions, nor did he ever silence a student in order to expound a view of his own: indeed, he never expressed an opinion of his own, instead trusting this class to judge actions based on fact.  Moreover, he demonstrated that criticism of Israeli government policy is not, and should not be equated with, anti-Semitism, which he, as any intelligent being, despises.  Massad's kindness and approachability allowed us to feel comfortable debating with him during class and office hours; his goal was for us to recognize fact, not to threaten our positions and opinions.  That this class was an eye-opener is, indeed, an understatement.

If you have digital logic background and some comp org knowledge, you most likely will be ok. However, if that is not the case, don't take this class with this professor unless you have tons of time to teach yourself!
The first half of the semester he covers digital logic using his own notes and the small appendix on the book which is not sufficient to understand the depth of the subject.

Broda is a sharp young economist from  the New York Federal Reserve, however he is not an enthusiastic teacher and is unfriendly towards students who rise mundane points or questions.  While he knows his matieral very well (like most economists), he gives the impression that he would rather work with mature and knowledgeable graduate students or other economists rather than with undergrads who want to fulfill a major requirement.
The most problematic part of the course was the final seminar paper assignment.  He gave no more than a few weeks to complete a difficult original paper, and certain students had more time than others to write it.  
As a Federal Reserve economist with a PhD from MIT, Broda expects graduate level research and doesn't realize most the students don't have the level of training and sophistication he demands.  Unless you intend to do graduate study in international finance and money and know your macro, micro and econometrics well, you may want to take a course with a different seminar instructor.  Broda is a bust as a teacher.

As you can already tell from the reviews written, Scott was just an incredibly wonderful writing teacher.  Not having taken a writing workshop in a while, and having had experienced some pretty unhelpful ones in the past, it was a relief to have Scott as a teacher.  Scott knew how to make the class work.  The mandatory meetings forced us to fully recognize the direction of our own writing and fully understand what we wanted it to become.  It was great that he made us critique others' work as we became very aware of what an audience needed from a writer.
Sometimes the peers' comments were useful, sometimes not, but I always took Scott's comments very seriously and my work always came out better in the end for it.
Overall Scott's strength came in knowing how to direct a good story to become exceptional (which comes from being a fantastic writer himself, which we found from him inviting us to his own readings in the city and from him showing us his own work).  He took immense interest in us and was just a great guy overall.  The class was fun and I always looked forward to it (which, since it was on a Thursday night from 7-9, is a pretty amazing statement).  He created a comfortable environment for critiquing without harshness.  He was a stickler for punctuality and the class was well organized, but not in a stifling way.  If you can get Scott as a teacher, do it.

Every semester Runsdorf teaches Critical Writing, which is probably the least desireable position in the English dept. But he loves it. Honestly, this guy is a total sweetheart, obviously brilliant, and manages to make an otherwise shitty requirement for the English major really interesting. He's totally available outside of class, is very concerned about his students, and gives what I consider to be some of the best writing criticism I've encountered so far.
Don't hesitate to take CW with him. Class is boring sometimes, but for the most part the syllabus is GREAT, the assignments are standard, and he's very flexible.

Basically what the other reviews said: totally laid back and easy-going, very encouraging but critical, and obviously knows his shit. My only complaint? He went to one of those hippie colleges (Hampshire) that don't give grades, so don't expect any actual grades. It can be difficult to figure out where you stand as far as that is concerned because he doesn't believe in grades, but rather criticism. 
If you're good, he'll hook you up with jobs and make connections for you. So if you're serious about it, definately take this class and get to know him.

If I had to rate mark on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being absolutely abhorrent and 10 being utterly fantastic, I'd probably give him a 7.  Overall, I think he was a competent, worthwhile instructor; he understood the material enough to have some sort of opinion on it (as opposed to merely regurgitating SparkNotes), had a definite sense of where he wanted the class to and had a pretty good rapport with the students.  Occasionally discussions would get a little confusing, however, though this seems almost unavoidable in CC when you're talking about such freaks as Nietzsche or Marx whose works are, by nature, quasi-incomprehensible.  I do think that Mark could've been a little clearer about certain things, increasing the amount of expository explanation, something which several people complained about towards the end of the semester (and, in response, he did in fact get a little more sensitive to the problem).  Like I said, though, Mark's a nice, intelligent guy, and while I don't recommend him with the utmost of enthusiasm, I consider him a qualified instructor out of whose clas you shouldn't rush to transfer.

He isnt one of those teachers that talks on another level and doesnt care that the class cant understand a thing of what he's saying.  Its the fact that there is too much material covered that he must go ridiculously fast, not that he doesnt care if you learn.  His grading policy is amazing.  He even says that when he took this course in college he didnt understand a damn thing.  He gave you the option to have the final count for your entire grade.  This made problem sets optional essentially, and gave you a way out if you messed up the midterm.  Then to make our lives even better, he gave us a sample final and used that pretty much with minor changes in numbers as the real final!

First of all I had the TA from hell.  Our class really studied for the midterm and he gave our disc section a avg of a 76!  I went to this guy's OH and he gave me the run around, you must make it plainly clear that you want an A.  From then on I got an A+ on the Final Paper and probably an A or something on the Final because I ended up with an A as a final grade.  But this didnt come without some anxiety.

We can glorify Professor Leighton for all the things listed below, and oh how true they are, but one key difference between Leighton's Orgo and just about every other class in the department has not been brought to light. The things he emphasizes in lectures are given exactly proportional attention on the exams, granting students the satisfaction of knowing that long study hours paid off. And he doesn't do this by taking exam questions straight out of the lectures -- rather, he makes it perfectly clear in the problems, often with a friendly hint, which of the many concepts he teaches he wants you to apply. Exams vary in difficulty, and so do the grades -- one of the consequences of such organization and clarity is that you'll really kick yourself for not getting something when you realize looking at the key that it was so simple and straight out of the notes. One more thing -- when you finish Orgo 1 with Cornish or Katz, just burn your textbook, because its convoluted and incomplete, and Leighton's material is so much better and more interesting, and of course, much more relevant to exam stuff.

I definitely agree with the last reviewer: don't try anything vaguely creative or even slightly more challenging with Weinstock because she will only appear confused and annoyed. Granted she's young, but according to her she's been teaching for ten years, and STILL needs time to grow into her role as professor?. She appears friendly and enthusiastic at first, but if she was really so excited about the material she wouldn't end class fifteen minutes early every single time, if she didn't cancel it all together!Furthermore, her own insecurities are revealed through her EXTREMELY patronizing attitude and failure to faciliate discussion. Able and engaging professors usually run class over the time limit, instead, we were usually faced with awkward silences that would lead to Weinstock ending the class with ""well, I don't want to beat a dead horse!."" Oh yeah, and expect ZERO constructive criticism of your papers beyond comma insertions and anything challenging is a big turn off to her.

I have to disagree with a number of things the previous reviewer writes.  First and foremost, Alexei is a nice guy but he does not care about the students one bit.  If he did, in my opinion he might have taught something of value in his lecture.  Maybe I'm not smart enough for this class--which I can readily accept--but I learned nothing in lecture and was not able to gain anything significant from the book either.  I don't know where the last guy heard that Macro is an easy A; I've never heard that in my life!  The added handicap of Alexei being a non-teacher did not help matters at all.  The only way to do well in this class is a. to have a good background in the subject from the get-go; b. be naturally inclined to learning difficult concepts (the SEAS and science majors must have thought this class was pish tosh, easy breezy); or c. be able to memorize the book front to back.  I cannot stress enough that this material is too difficult to learn on one's own.  I learned very little in this class, although I gave it a chance til the very end; I showed up to every lecture and recitation--although I stopped going to recitation after I studied 5 days for the midterm, got a C, and realized Onatski is not interested in people like me, who are willing to work hard to understand but just can't because the man doesn't explain anything.  His lectures are in fact derivations and proofs, which you'll never need to know and only serve to confuse you more.   I'm warning you--unless you already know what's up, don't take this class thinking you'll learn macroeconomics because i guarantee that you won't!

Gluck is a big name, so that combined with my excitement over the syllabus for this class (see workload below) and the fact that it fulfils a List B Major Cultures requirement made me assume everything would be hunky-dory.  Unfortunately, this was not the case.  First of all, Gluck would lecture straight with no breaks for the entire class, so around 1:15-1:30 almost everyone would start to get a little antsy.  Further, from the first session to the last, she'd go on not for the 1h50m alloted for the class, but for at least 2 full hours, if not 2:10, a seemingly small difference but one that really suck when you're sitting in an uncomfortable SIPA connected desk-chair unit.  Okay, small complaint; now onto bigger ones.  Basically, the class was mixed, about half undergrads and half grads, so from the start the material was oriented more towards those with some sense of Japan's intellectual history and background than those who were just taking it to fulfill a requirement and learn a few things.  I'd taken David Lurie's [awesome] Intro to Japan Civ class the previous semester, so I picked up on some of the facts Gluck would refer to here and there, but if I hadn't -- if I'd taken an intro Chinese class, for example, since intro to Japan isn't a prereq -- I would've been pretty lost.  Also, the woman is clearly a giant in the field, and she spoke like one; unfortunately, the result was that I would drift in and out as she spoke about all sorts of things that were just too complex or detailed to follow and which seemed to be more directed at the grad students than anyone else.  (I might just be stupid, but I don't think that's it.)  The weekly 50min discussion sections were pretty much useless; my TA was earnest and cute (Federico Marcon), but you'd need a 5h discussion section to really explicate Gluck's lectures.  We generally wound up having fairly superficial conversations about fluff.  I got a pretty good grade, because the grading was lenient (as I expected it would be, since neither Gluck or Marcon are stupid and mostly knew that the undergrads were at a lower level than the grads), but I barely learned anything and was bored for most of the semester.  Gluck is continually revising the course (as evidenced by the changing title [it used to be called Intellectual History of Japan or something]), but until she can correct the balance between stultifying academic material and easier, dummy-oriented stuff, you can find a better class.

This course gives a very basic introduction to economics, which makes it pretty easy for anyone with a solid grasp of the way the marketplace functions in the first place.

If you don't understand why it's not a good idea to carry balances on your credit card, you'll have trouble with this course.
The problem is that Desai teaches down to the level of the people who have no hope of understanding the material. She teaches almost straight from the book, even using exactly the same examples contained in the book. She then spends about every third lecture doing an in-class problem set, more or less identical in form to the homework problem sets, which felt like a bit of a waste, since that's what the recitations should be for. Instead, the recitations were a total waste, with the TAs spending all of their time helping out the people who had no hope of understanding the material.
To give an idea of how ill-suited some of the students were for the course, high school algebra is required. During the final exam, after complaints that people didn't know how to handle the math, the head TA gave a quick lesson in how to divide one simple fraction by another. That Columbia students taking a course that requires high school math were upset at having to do elementary school level math is amazing. The course was set up to cater to those people, who by all rights should have chosen a different course.
Because the curve has to take the hopeless people into account, someone who understands the basic concepts can get a B without any effort, and without necessarily doing the homework.

I love history, so overall I enjoyed this class.  BUT...and this is a biggie...Pablo is boring as all heck.  The material is interesting, although it often seems super general and super basic,  but Pablo is just not an interesting lecturer.  He is indeed adorable and very approachable, but not interesting.  I think that if I weren't interested in the subject in the first place, I'd find this class a nightmare.  Covering 200 years of history about a continent and a half is simply impossible, and it showed.  It seemed like the most important things I'd heard of before and hoped to actually learn in this class were left out.  I was shocked when Piccato never mentioned the names Salvador Allende (who magically appeared on the final exam for the first time!) or Augusto Pinochet.  He did go on at length about how sugar cane is processed into consumable sugar in Brazil, the significance of baseball in 1960s Cuba, and the extent of prostitution in Mexican cities.  These are admittedly important topics, but that doesn't mean he should have excluded other obviously important info to go on about that.  But I digress...Very important: make sure you go to lecture--there's no other way to pass this class, since the readings are basically supplementary.

You've got to go to class because bonus point assignments are given out (some involve spending time outside of class on NMR - make the time!).    They add up.

I feel really bad giving Smith a bad review, because he's such a nice guy, and his laughter is infectious. He's quite pleasant and tries to keep the class interested by cracking jokes... but unfortunately, the jokes can only go so far. Half the class stopped going around february/march (including myself) because the man just can't teach. His handwriting is horrible and he meanders around for the whole lecture, actually soliciting the class what they would like to talk about.... inappropriate!! He takes questions from the audience and tries to learn names... just teach the goddamn stuff and there would be less questions!! In any case, it's the easiest class ever. The first half really really sucks (i got a C+ on the midterm) but the end is easy and a good opportunity to up your grade. You can easily improve over the semester and be rewarded for it.

Professor Jervis is a very friendly and capable teacher.  She did very well teaching our small class (7 students).  We went over the material (Livy) at just the right pace.  She always allowed questions and even amended her syllabus when we complained.  We had two midterms, not that bad, and a final.  We also did an in class presentation which was fun and had a short paper to write in the end.  The material itself is a bit challenging because it is a lot of battlefield description.  Book 6 which we did during the second half of the semester is harder than book 1.  I would reccomend taking this class especially if it is going to be a small group of students.  Jervis is an engaging teacher who knows her stuff but is not intimidating.

Dhrymes has a wealth of knowledge, but simply cannot deliver the content to his students.  He teaches very poorly, and it should be said that the generalites of the other reviews hold true.  However, I can see this professor appealing to a select few.  Those who prefer/well-versed  in mathematics/statistics will do well (IEOR folks seemed to have an easier time with this particular class.)  Those suited to more abstract, theoretical ideas will also do well in this class.  Dhrymes teaches more from a ""general concept,"" appealing to methods and theories rather than numeric examples.  That said, it is incredibly easy to get lost in his class, but if you are capable in this style, his tests reflect this tendency and may even complement a few students, although from my experience, not many.
The TA was the saving grace, and if you do not have a competent one, you might as well drop this course, as there are really no other resources that will make anything easier to understand.  In all, a select few may benefit from Dhrymes' experience and style, but it's not for the majority of students.

The below review (starting w/ the Seneca quote) was fantastic and, in my opinion, almost completely right on. 
The only thing I disagree with is that it's just fine to sit through Taylors class without calling him on his teaching. First of all, as undergrads 99% of us don't really know enough to call out a professor and there's no need to do that sort of thing (I I don't buy the positive feedback argument) because it makes for an uncomfortable class experience for ALL the students. Just sit through the class like I did (and like the reviewer did) - you'll learn a hell of a lot and you'll learn extra because by disagreeing with Taylor you'll help shape your own opinions.

Harrison White opened up class by declaring that his mission was for his students to see the social/cultural world in non-deterministic and multi-faceted ways. He described the social sciences as a type of ""walnut"", where we must learn to ""lick"" the ""correct delineated wrinkles"" (These are ACTUAL notes). So upon even first impressions, we knew that, in fact, this guy's a *nut*.
The nature of the class was entirely seminar-based. The syllabus was never followed. And we only had to read his extremely cryptic book called ""Creation and Careers in Art Worlds."" Basically, if one has to put it lightly, the class was based on rationalizing his whacky theories.  The nature of our discussions ranged from Mickey Mouse, Gay Sex Clubs, Gallery Worlds, Indie Music, etc. etc., but all discussed in a *roundabout* way, which ultimately pointed to the nature of his own written works. 
Still, while we had this in mind, none of us really knew what the class was about. It  was COMPLETE CHAOS. But also really fun.

I don't know who has written some of these reviews, but Valentini is a terrible teacher.  By the end of the semester, maybe 30 out of over 100 people would show up to lecture.  I went in the beginning, but gradually went less often as I realized the lectures were boring and a complete waste of time.  He teaches little chemistry and rambles a lot about plumbing, pools, etc.  He lectures straight off Powerpoint slides and he puts them online, so as long as you read over the slides before the exam, class is unnecessary.  His exams are definitely hard.  You really have to understand ALL of the material and even if you do, he'll still trick you on a few questions.  I got an A - in the class, but this was only because I did problems from the textbooks on my own.  Basically, try to avoid Valentini, but if you can't, just plan on spending a lot of time teaching yourself chemistry.

Donna Masini is exactly what I needed in a writing instructor. Definitely choose her section if you have already done a lot of creative writing and are looking for an instructor who will actually give you useful criticism instead of babying you. In response to the previous reviewer, I don't think she played favorites at all, and I actually found her to be steering us away from sentimentality and cliches - something I greatly appreciate as I see overcoming stereotypes as an important part of growing as a writer. I think Donna is actually interested in her students' pieces, which is something not often seen in college classrooms. This made all the difference for me. In addition, she once taught our class while having a migraine, which shows some incredible dedication!
In short, you can take a class where the instructor and your classmates will respond to your writing with, ""Oh, I really liked it, it's great...next person, please,"" or you can take Donna Masini's class and actually learn something. I definitely reccommend her.

Yes, Nim Tottenham taught the lecture course and was amazing.  HOWEVER, what they don't tell you when you join the lab portion of the class is that Prof. DesRosiers teaches the lab.  She is TERRIBLE....stay away from her at all costs.  She has little to no patience for the toddlers she works with, much less the students she teaches.  Her expectations are confusing at best, and her grading is even more arbitrary.  Prof. DesRosiers is reason enough NOT to take Developmental psych lab; not only does she expect you to know EVERYTHING about writing a mini-dissertation (which is what all of her assignments turn out to be) but she also screams at the class for not being able to write sections of the lab reports that should be ""second nature"" for us...(i.e. sections that she NEVER went over in class).

At first glance of the the uber-long review given below, I thought to myself, what is this person talking about?  But after mulling it over for a bit, I feel the need to clarify and add a few thoughts of my own.  Besides, half the class has already reviewed Taylor, so here's my take:
I disagree that Taylor is a mercenary; He is truly engaged in and excited about his work.  Whatever success he has enjoyed he has earned, and I don't think that there's a mercenary or dishonest bone in his body.  On the other hand, as the other reviewer has pointed out, he has constructed a certain image of himself that is somewhat disingenuous.  (I'm not sure how to describe it other than that it involves wearing cowboy boots and throwing around words like ""preontological""; whatever that means.) 
I think Taylor once made the distinction between being a scholar and a ""thinker.""  I have no doubt that Taylor thinks of himself as a thinker and expects his students to operate as thinkers as well, but he does so at the expense of scholarship.  He provides no real critique or historical perspective for much of the syllabus.  There is little or no forum for challenging the validity of the arguments of many of the writers (esp. certain of his favorites) or of the claims of postmodernism in general.  He is truly the ""insider"" of postmodernism, and if you plan on challenging his assertions be prepared for a long, drawn out debate that you will lose.
As far as his teaching abilities, Taylor structures the class as a dialogue between the thinkers we have read, which would be fruitful except that very few of us understood the readings to begin with.  A class that deals with postmodernism at the undergrad level really needs to be much more straightforward, at least at first, before we can all enter the illustrious ""thinker"" stage.  
Despite all this, I am glad I took this class, because I can honestly say that I learned a lot both from the readings, my classmates and Taylor  (in that order).  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  Do not take this class if you value your GPA.

Anise Strong is by far the best TA I've ever had at Columbia.   She knew the answer to every question--no matter how obscure--asked by the students in our section.  Her section was, at times, like another lecture and greatly supplemented the reading.  Other times, she would just spend the entire section helping students understand the more subtle aspects of the material studied.  I can not say enough good things about her.  Unlike other sections, hers were always interesting, sometimes fun, and never tedious.

Nancy Worman is one of the most dynamic lectures I have ever had. Her lecture style is enthusiatic and upbeat and she is brillant. It is rare that you find a professor who can truly offer you a new reading of a text and change the way you look at it. Some of the texts can be boring, but her lectures make them interesting. Take notes - they will help greatly on the midterm (and final if she gives one). I definitly recommend you take her class if you like Greek and Roman literature, you will not regret it!

The class is easy. He wants his students to have some background in environmental biology or ecology, but his class is just a repeat of basic concepts. Be sure to participate in class (your grade depends on it). He seems to be a pretty good scientist, but I feel that he misuses philosophical terms.

 First of all, Professor D'Altroy is a really nice guy. Not a pushover, though. His lectures are really packed with a lot of information and the pace is very fast. He clearly outlines the basic themes of the course at the beginning...how to sythesize and approach the material. If one keeps these points in mind when taking notes and studying, it really is not an overload.  I felt this semester was heavier on theory than I anticipated from reading past Culpa reviews.  We were encouraged throughout to utilize the ""big picture."" Before the exams, D'Altroy gave out example essay questions and I found this helpful.  There is a manageable amount of reading - not light (if one does all of it), but certainly not horrible. Plus, in the final crunch, the outlines supplied by D'Altroy are what I relied on for exam preparation and fleshed this out with class notes. This course can appear overwhelming, with a moderate effort combined with strategic studying, it is not that hard to get an A in this course. I felt that the very nature of the course whas such that I felt we kind of skimmed over the cultures...(despite the fact that D'Altroy speaks very fast and really tries to cram as much in as he humanly can). It is a fair overview and comparison. One high compliment for D'Altroy: If he doesn't know something (he admits that China is not his strongpoint), he will honestly and refreshingly say ""I don't know."" But this guy knows a whole lot. He's not an armchair intellectual having spend decades in the field. His area of expertise is South America especially Peru. I recommend this course.

I don't know where to begin. Prof. Scharffenberger is one of those rare instructors that you hear about, but never seem to meet.  She learned everyone's name within the first week, never seemed to have any favorites or create any clique-like following that popular teachers sometimes do. She is approachable, extremely helpful and puts a tremendous amount of time into each student. Class discussions are fast, exciting, very respectful, and focused. She is able to have total control and at the same time keep the ideas coming.  She never put anyone on the spot if they don't participate in the discussion on a particular day. She is eager to go over papers and exams individually with students, and seems to expect one on one meetings. She is organized, knowledgable, irreverent, funny, outrageous. Professor Scharffenberger is not to be missed. Her energy has got to be seen to be believed. I looked forward to her class so much and found it to be a real tonic to the grind of the semester. The writing assignments kind of piled up at the end. As a result, I was feeling a little punch drunk with that. But, she's so good it was worth it. Because of her, I wish I was a Classics major....

Joel Kaye is a really nice guy and you can tell right away that he really wants to teach (ie: he left about 10 minutes at the end of class to answer questions). The information covered in this class is also very interesting. However, it was frustrating at times to be a history major because it is so introductory. This is almost like a survey of middle ages history and you will dabble in a little bit of philosophy, religious history and politics, without really ever discussing the issues in depth. Also, there is hardly any reading. I think it's great that he focuses so much on primary sources, but we really didn't have any secondary sources, besides a textbook and a few articles in the course packet. While it's important to focus on the documents, it would have been nice to read scholars' opinions besides those of Prof. Kaye. Kaye is a good professor and he really cares- I would recommend this class to someone who truly wants an introduction to the middle ages, but if you want to take a real history class, it leaves much to be desired. In addition, since it's an intro class you often feel like you're being treated like you're in high school- everything's explained on a basic level (which is often good since most people aren't very familiar with the middle ages), but  it can get a bit tedious when the TAs go so far as to explain how to take an exam or write a paper.

The material covered in this class is fascinating and for anyone interested in urban planning, European cities, or churches I would definitely recommend it. Another cool thing about the class is that she brings in lots of guest speakers from other schools to talk about different subjects.  There are, however, some negatives to the class. First, I felt as though Ballon was trying to cover so much that she never really got to round out her arguments by the end of each lecture. I have to disagree with the person who said that there is a lot of reading- as an undergraduate, I was shocked by how little reading this graduate class had. She does, however, give you bibliographies of other related books if you want to read more. Additionally, since there were no discussion sections, I felt as though I didn't have to keep up with the reading. And, because she gives you the essay questions for the final and midterm before hand, you can read a few key readings a few days before, memorize the slides and be fine. Frankly, I think that this is definitely an 'ace-able' class because she lays out exactly what you have to do and the questions on the finals and midterms focus on the key points of the class.  Her paper topics were interesting and varied, and seemed to be graded fairly. I would recommend this class- it's really interesting, she's a great lecturer and really, you only have to do about 15% of the readings to get by, and many of them were skimmable.

Larsen is not so bad as the other reviewer portrays her. Certainly she is not the best, most thought-provoking Lit Hum instructor. I never felt once that I was really grappling with the material in her class. But often I felt that she provided one or two interesting insights per book that shed light on the work as a whole. She was not a great Lit Hum teacher, but an average one. About 16 students chose to stay in her class for the second semester, reflecting that most students in the class thought she was at worst decent.
One other point to make about Larsen is about her choice of optional texts. She included Sappho, Athanasius, and Toni Morrison, reflecting her greater interests. She is interested in early Christianity and in female authors.

Ben Martin will probably be the best teacher I will ever have at Columbia.  As the other review states he is only a graduate student, but he knows how to run a class.  He lectures for 5 minutes at the beginning of each class about the life of each author, but that is the longest you will ever hear him speak consecutively in class.  His questions are very well formulated and he strongly encourages student participation.  The discussions are incredibly enlightening and thought-provoking, (I was especially lucky to have a fairly opinionated and diverse group of talkative classmates).  My favorite aspect of Mr. Martin's teaching was that he never brought his personal opinion into the classroom.  
His grading can be harsh -- he is a former Chicago University student.  His assignments are challenging yet have really improved the way I think critically.  I strongly recommend taking CC with him if you can, you will not regret it.

First of all this class isn't really for the faint of heart unless you intend to do some theory math or be a computer science major. Even though it is in the computer science department don't be fooled it is a math class, algorithms are involved, but the primary workload will be done in math. 
Professor Grunschlag, like to be called Zeph often in class, is a very entertaining professor, but the man knows his shit, he has a PHD in some theoretical math that i don't understand. You can look at his papers on his website. His in class style is bell to bell an intense, but he is light hearted and loves to be in front of the class room. Zeph is also very well prepared, and has an interesting way of taking attendance. He randomly calls on just about everyone in the class about 3 times from an attendance sheet to learn your names. If your not there when he calls on you, tough luck, you loose points in participation. He will learn your names. He also has an online email newsletter thing that if you participate in instead of going to class he will accept that as participation. Material is tuff, and he is more the willing to help anybody, because sometimes the class isn't enough. Great guy, awesome professor, and if you are going to take Discrete Math I suggest you take it with him.

principles of economics under gulati seems like an advance economics course for me. his materials are unneccessarily hard. yes , he is interesting, he is a great professor, but you can hardly get a good grade from him because his tests are just too hard. I worked very hard and still got an A-, because he only gave out like 15As out of a class of 250+ students. The curve is set as a B/B+ and there are so many terms in the final that you have never ever heard of and you just have to leave the entire long question blank. fully understanding and knowing your text book can give you an A- , for an A, i guess you have to be an economics genius (but this is only a Principles of Economics course)

Professor Ancona was an extremely nice person, but not a very good professor.  She is an adjunct professor who seemed to understand Financial Econ at a very broad level, but did not have a clear grasp of the underlying details.

Also, she is new to teaching (or at least gives that impression) and is still figuring things out.

Hope you remembered your stats and probability, because this is a prob/stats class.  Till is a very nice professor who is more than willing to help you out with a subject that can be difficult and frustrating.  He was always willing to answer students questions or spend time with someone to help them through a particular topic.  I know that some students complained about the problem sets being to long and difficult and he did respond by cutting down on some of the workload.  The TAs that I worked with were not very helpful, though I heard one other was very helpful with homework, so it's probably in your best interest to shop the TAs.  I also discovered that my TA didn't always agree on everything, that the Professor taught, which did lead to confusion when attending the midterm and final study sessions, or during the recitation.  One negative about Till is that class tended to run five to ten minutes long every session.  After an hour and fifteen minutes of econometrics, you are ready to leave!

I love professor russell! I totally disagree with all the other reviews given about this teacher. She is so knowledgeable about the material, but the important thing is that she is sooo nice. She is THRILLED to help students on their papers, to just come talk to them after class, and to really get to know her students, even to talk to them on the phone during her own free time to help them out. I spoke to her many times throughout the semester and always found her engaging and insightful, not to mention very helpful on providing sources for papers. The class itself is discussion based and, while not all did participate, the ones who did I think got a lot out of the discussions, which I think really did pertain to the readings, contrary to the previous reviewer.

This is the only review I've ever done on CULPA, and I'm writing it to spare others the aggravation of taking a class with this professor.  She is not professor material--certainly not Barnard/Columbia material, and probably not even high school material. Her ""lectures"" were the worst I've experienced in my 3 years of college, and her ability to foment interesting discussion was virtually non-existent. Furthermore, she took weeks to correct our midterms, and as of June 7th I've heard neither hide nor hare about our second papers (due mid/late April), final exams (early May), or final grades. Previous CULPA reviews warned me about her, but I ignored them; BIG MISTAKE. My intellectual development would have been much better served spending 3 credit hours per week huffing solvents instead of diligently attending her classes. They are a total waste of your money and time. The good news is that, like the large portion of the class that did so, you can safely skip every last one of her lectures and probably still do very well. But if you want to learn anything whatsoever, look elsewhere. My advice: if you see a class she's teaching that looks interesting, buy the books on the reading list (if she bothers to make one up). then don't take the class.

Highly recommended course. While many will assert (rightfully) that Professor Carnes (America Since 1945) is more ""entertaining"" given his nonesuch ability to tirelessly expound delectable witticisms (you will find yourself laughing every class, sometimes even uproariously...his personality more than compensates for the mordacious, I-was,-like-a-
loser,-at-the-West-End-until-5 a.m. eye-stinging that the 11 a.m. start time will probably bring about), Dr. Plaa's course is the (emphasis on the) history course at Barnard that you will enjoy due to the actual content of the course and not, say, your professor's affected erudition or ability to constantly titillate your fancy (like a personal minstrel!). Do not be mistaken: Plaa is an excellent, knowledgable professor (you will be in awe about how much he knows about the time period and European history on the whole) who is blesed with the ability to relay his knowledge in a perspicuous and engaging manner. While he does lecture with a certain degree of  ""note-taking unfriendly"" celerity, one becomes inured to this after two weeks so do not fret; moreover, forasmuch as Plaa uses a great deal of statistical substantiation for nearly every assertion (for an instance, he evinced the Cold War economic strength of the USA/Western Europe vis-a-vis the U.S.S.R. with consumer data such as television sets per household in each respective country, etc.), you can generally ignore about 1/3 of the things that he will say about what he posits insofar as such statistics are not (as far as tests are concerned) pertinent. I should add that you still ought to listen, though: Plaa is truly a fascinating lecturer and what he has to say is always interesting. The salient feature of Plaa's character, however, has to be his affability, this in and of itself serving as an incentive to enroll in his course. While I obviously have not met every professor at Columbia, I cannot imagine that there is another knowledgable, PhD- holding historical or otherwise savant who is more or even as likeably pleasant as Plaa: he really has no ego or, if he does, dissembles such narcissism impeccably well as he does not interminably prattle on about himself and/or his accomplishments/publications, is readily avaliable for discussion outside of class (more or less) and is exceedingly genial (he actually greets you if you have his discussion section!) If you're a history-loving frosh who is also a sap for personalities, make Plaa's course your first history one because such a) will benefit you inasmuch as Eurpe Since 1789 is an intro course b) will allow you to lead a decadent lifestyle with impunity (it starts in the afternoon in the Spring) and c) will allow you to enjoy the class to the fullest and not be afflicted with an anticlimax malaise due to a previous entertainment of Carnes' ""America Since 1945"" (a mistake I made... but Dr. Plaa also has the right to be full of himself but admirably chooses not to be...he is certainly on that Foner-Carnes level). In short, do not graduate without having taken this course if you have even a modicum of interest in history. 
Workload:
Midterm and final for which Plaa gives you a study aid (what a guy! :-)  ), rendering them preparation exams rather than ""cudgel thy brains to bethink minutiae"" exams (but do actually prepare because of such a nature; Plaa, the consummate fair grader will not let you get away with fluff on exams for which he provided you with the goddamn questions beforehand.) Two papers (4-5 and 6-8 pages respectively) that are a document analysis and a book review. Standard history class amount of reading (150 pages a week or so) but if you attend class and take decent notes, you do not have to read anything (safe for the document for the analysis and the book for the review, obviously). Fairly straight forward; an A is attainable if you try.

I ought to not further extol the man because, considering the antecedent reviews, any more praise of Carnes would be gratuitous but, well, his charisma besots students, inexplicably impelling them to indite sonnets and panegyrical testimonials about the beloved legend of 320 Barnard. He is the history department's version of Michael Jordan: one would truly prefer to despise the guy because of his unabashed hauteur (make no mistake: he is noticeaably arrogant) but, well, forasmuch as Carnes consistently ""throws down his 32"", is consistently hilarious and enthralling lecturer, one is forced to avouch his grandeur. Carnes is not all style and no substance: he is actually knowledgable and insightful, eschewing a regurgitation of historical bromides and instead propounding fresh, thought-provoking analyses (to respond one of the above reviewers, every American history book that one entertains from infancy suggests that the causative of the Vietnam War or rather its perpetuation was Cold War posturing/domestic politics; at least Carnes, in his ""hubris assessment"", manages to introduce a new phrase into the Vietnam War anatomy lexicon. And on discontent about Carnes' treatment of Watergate: come on... who really does not know about Watergate? Why not then, as Carnes does, concentrate on the ""larger issue"" i.e. the furtive malfeasance and cabalist machination of Nixon's administration that still largely remains unbeknowst to the general public?) Carnes is the sort of professor that makes you actually want to attend class; its 11 a.m. start time and Monday-Wednesday schedule will inevitably result in an episode or two of truancy but one will find oneself repining for Carnes class.  Like Foner's Civil War course, Carnes' ""America Since 1945 "" is a must for anyone who, after four years, will want to have been minimally compensated for their $170,000  ""contribution"" to the ""wax the Alma Mater"" fund. You will not regret your enrollment.
Workload:
A slightly less-than-standard history class load (100-150 pages a week) of reading that Carnes qualifies as ""optional"" but, well, really is not. My advice is to read the transcripts of the Senate hearings in the McCarthyism book and certain ""important"" speeches in the Vietnam book (say, the LBJ 1968 ""I shall not seek..."" address and Bao Di's abdication) because they will be used as identifications on the midterm and/or final. A potentially difficult midterm and final insofar as, well, the sequence identifications can kill: there is some truth in the above reviewer's assertion that your grade could depend on whether or not you know, say,  when abortion was legalised in Connecticut (the sequences can be that punctilious). Optional paper that counts for 1/3 of your grade as it can be substituted for the final exam essay section. Do not do this paper forasmuch as people who do it generally receive Bs on it (the indolence penalty) and the final essays are ""fun"" in the masochistic sense of that term (Carnes calls them ""interpretative""). NO SECTION!!! The m.o. for an A is the following: a) attend 90% of the lectures (you'll want to anyway...in the event that you ever feel like skipping, however, do so during the first ""feminism"" lecture: I am not a sexist or anything: this can be done simply because Carnes repeats most of the themes of this lecture in a later ""Fall of the ERA"" one. The other possible skip date is the ""Great Mandella"" one - it is interesting but, well, insofar as your grade is concerned, inconsequential) b) purchase (unless it is posted like last fall) the exam booklet to gain some sense of exam format and with such in mind c) read the relevant sections of the readings for test identifications and d) make sure that you have every handout as the midterm and final exam sequences require that one essentialy memorises certain ""salient"" dates contained on the handouts.

At first, I liked Prof. Van De Mieroop. He is obviously an intelligent man (a top dog in MEALAC, or so I hear) with an interesting background and interesting ideas about the things he studies. He is also not afraid to tell a student when they are wrong, which is always a plus. On top of that, he conducts Lit Hum very informally. You can say what you want and when, and he often dismissed us after only an hour or so. Despite all this, the class was a complete drag. I dreaded it every Tues/Thur, and found myself watching the clock throughout. It wasn't until I switched classes second semester that I figured out why. Like other reviewers have mentioned, Prof. Van De Mieroop doesn't want to be in class any more than his students do. This makes the class easy to coast through, but it also makes for lackluster discussion and general ill-will amongst students. TAKE IT FROM ME: A Lit Hum professor who is excited about the material and teaching it makes that class worth it (not to mention bearable), even if he/she expects a little more of you than the Van De Mieroops out there.

He holds an intellectual conviction and offers rational, clear, and cogent arguments (supported with a wide-range of evidence including facts, figures, dates, and documentation) to support it.  One of the very first lessons learned is that it is impossible to show both sides of the picture.  Regardless of one's previous knowledge or bias on the topic, Massad forces the student to confront typical themes and at least question one's own beliefs by presenting the student with a broad base of pertinent and strong knowledge from his incredibly informative lectures, ranging from social, religious, and racial relationships and discrimination, to feminist issues, to historical development.  He doesn't  expect you to always agree with him and welcomes active debate in and outside of class.  Of course, the typical knock on Massad is that he often interrupts the questions asked by the students.  This critique is true, but is often engendered by students making arguments or asking questions that were clearly answered or addressed in the reading.  Massad expects the reading to be done and gets somewhat offended if it is not.  He is always available outside of class for his students; however, he changes his office hours quite frequently but always gives students ample notice and alternate times to meet, making him very accessible.  But most of all, he clearly cares about his students.  Outside of class, when bumping into students, he takes the time to see how they are doing, being truly inquisitive and caring.  He also knows each of his students; rather than just melting into the background as spoiled kids he must teach, he takes the students seriously and gives them the respect that many professors on this campus do not.

Much of what other reviewers have said is correct: Scharffenberger is very nice, extremely approachable, learned everyone's names, and encouraged discussion. She is not, however, a great professor. I learned virtually nothing in her class, which was wasted listening to the often inane comments of students who liked to hear their own voices. Discussion is fine, but not when lecture is sacrificed for it and not when the professor is unwilling or unable to tell someone he or she is wrong. Furthermore, when Scharffenberger did lecture, she offered virtually nothing in the way of in depth analysis and admitted that she had not studied this material for 20 years. While it was fun to read Euripides and Aeschylus, I can do that on my own. If you want an easy A, this is the class for you. If you want to learn something, I've heard that Steiner teaches this class with more scholarly rigor.

 This was my favortie class. Yes Professor Gill expects a lot out of her Reacting students. But, truth be told, the more you put into this calss the more you get out of it. She is a really great instructor for Reacting, generally finding a good balance between letting us go at it, and getting involved. She really tried to mix up the factions for the second game so that the ""quiet people"" would be able to work in different groups and perhaps be heard. It is a second semester Reacting course, which by nature demands public speaking, so it is not crazy that she expects real particapation.  She does however approach the ""louder people"" as well, in hopes that they will allow the quiet people more room to get itn ot hte debate, which  was generally very heated. She was very encouraging; less than an hour after I gave my first speech, I  got an email  about it, giving me a needed confidence boost. She truly cares about her students both in class and outside of class. We went ot her house for dinner and were there for hours. The more work you put into this class the better you will do and hte more you will learn. I know more about India than france, becuase i worked my butt off for the second game, and am glad i did. she said herself that""it is hard not to inflate grades in Reacting"" so grading is not so frightening. But you do feel a responsibility (or should) to do the work so that you dont screw over otehr people in your faction. Professor Gill is great, as was her Reacting course. If you are going to take Reacting II take it with Gill.

Professor McCaskill is very nice, and it's clear she cares about her students.  I've also heard she holds great review sessions and  explains things well in lab.  However, her class was one of the most frustrating experiences I've had in college so far.  In lecture, she would read straight from Powerpoint slides which were so poorly organized and incoherently written it often seemed she had not taken enough time to prepare.  She did not explain the often difficult terms and concepts on the slides-- she just read them, leaving us to try to decipher them later.  Reading the book was helpful sometimes, but she often contradicted what it said.  So studying for tests meant trying to make sense of her slides, memorizing lots of material I didn't fully understand, and trying to decide whether to follow the book or her.  Basically, this class took really interesting material and made it painful.  I got the impression that she didn't care if we understood anything-- she just wanted us to memorize it.  If you're really interested in knowing and understanding this stuff, don't take this class-- it might turn you off from neuroscience.

Oh Boy. This was a tough class through which to sit. This guy like graduated from harvard and studied under B.F. Skinner at columbia.

His book, which he wrote and was nice enough to make everyone buy, reads like stereo instructions. nothing was clear. 
the TA's were more help than he was. During the pre-midterm review session, it would be a safe bet that everyone inattendance learned more in that 2 hours than in a semester. it would be a mistake to take this class and hope to learn anything. nice guy, though.

Prof. Spiegel can seem a little spacey but all in all I thought the class was worth it. She picked a decent selection of literature, and if you're worried that ""British"" works are going to be all staid and stodgy then you're in for a surprise - we read covered the decline of empire and the traditional British society, sex and violence, race relations, all that. We had to see just as many movies outside of class as there were books (something I didn't expect), and that was a real crapshoot - some of the films were brilliant, others were unrelated to the books and utter wastes of time where I thought I'd run out of the room screaming. That being said, you could probably get by in this class only reading a couple of the books so long as you see some films.
In such a huge class there was a tendency for just a few people to dominate conversation. This is one of the easier English classes, and people knew it. Anglophiles like myself will pleased. On top of this, Maura is a genuinely nice person who will talk with you at length about any topic in British literature. She certainly knows her stuff, and I enjoyed her lecturing style - it kept me awake, which is something I can't say about all my professors.
HOWEVER, A MAJOR POINT: It is now June 11, I handed in my final papers a month ago, and I have yet to see a grade. This bothers me, and I'm sure it's bothering the graduated seniors even more. Also, we never got around to reading any of the short stories on the syllabus, nor did we have a final novel (all of the possibilities she had originally presented looked very interesting, and so I was disappointed when we never read them).

Prof. Massad is one of the best professors at Columbia. Always approachable and always kind to his students, Prof. Massad created an intellectually serious and open climate in the class. 
At no point in the class did Prof. Massad ever compromise his unfailing opposition to racism, anti-Semitism and colonialism. It is unclear how this could not be entirely obvious to anyone who took Prof. Massad's class, unless they failed to complete the required readings or to attend the lectures and discussion sections.
I strongly recommend taking any class that Prof. Massad is teaching, even (or particularly) if you are not majoring or concentrating in MEALAC (like myself) -- you will learn things in his classes that go far beyond their express subject matter.

Saito-Sensee is a wonderful teacher.  I am Japanese and I am familiar with the work ethic of the culture as a whole, so I can appreciate her perfectionism and meticulous attention to detail.  However, if you want to learn this language - she is the way to go, if she's back next year.  She is kind and fair, despite her demanding workload and strict classroom rules.  She wants to hear your questions, she wants you to understand and she will never explain anything to you as ""Well,  it's just like that in Japanese and  you have to learn it.""  If there is a reason, she will find it for you if she does not know why something is, and she will explain it to the best of her ability.  She is funny and engaging in class.  The class itself is fast-paced though and very difficult, so it thins out quickly.  Saito-Sensee's class started with nearly 30 students and I think by the end of the year there were about 15.  She sees RIGHT THRU people and she knows who is in the class because they want to be, and who is in the class because they took it on a whim.  She will make EVERY effort to help you though, so utilize her office hours when you need to.  She appreciates this effort.

Hefty. DO NOT take this course because you ""think it would be cool"" to speak some Japanese.  You will have ONE WEEK to learn all 60 plus characters of the hirigana writing set.  You will then be expected to use it on every quiz and test and hw and it does take some time.  You will have homework, every class - at least an hour and a half to two hours.  And every other class you will have a lab due, which will take you between an hour and two hours in the basement of Lewisohn Hall, depending on how much time you spend.  If you have the time, really do the labs meticulously, because the orals on the tests are similar to the lab excercises.  You will also have a quiz EVERY SINGLE CLASS, on vocab and grammar.  You cannot miss a class because you will miss the quiz and get a zero, and when you come back the next class, you'll fail the quiz on the grammar points covered while you were not there the class before.  This class is ALOT of work for 2.5 credits.  I found it to be worth it, but honestly, I did more work for these 2.5 credits than for any of my other regular 3 credit courses this semester.

I don't know what people expected when taking this course - it's not listed as a current events class.  Or as a discussion forum for the War in Iraq.  While I hate that I had to take Dynamics after getting a 4 on the AP Gov exam as a senior - it was not falsely advertised.  This class is about the fundamentals of American government.  It is disappointingly similar to AP Govt, but until Banard offers exemption for a four on the test, so be it.  It touches on key points including congress, the presidency, precedent laws, social movements and human rights.  I feel like anyone could benefit from having some sort of background in these things, so that later in life, you don't have to look like an ignorant monkey in public.

Lots of reading - I kept up at first and kinda started to fall off the wagon toward the end.  Either way, the reading is interesting in general, especially for those in the major.  They are things that you will be asked to read and reference again and again I am sure.  I loved that we had no textbook, because it pulled more out of your own head for papers and less from a common reference point.  There are four short papers - two are from in class ""debates"", which aren't really debates.  They were graded by Melanie, I think, a TA.  That part was no good, since she's inconsistent and a tad immature in the way she conducts herself around students.  (Very ""look at me, I graduated with a Poli Sci degree!!!"")  But in general, you have ample opportunities to write well enough to earn your grades.  Be originial in your theses.  If you support them well, even if she doesn't agree, she'll go with you on them.

Discussion sections basically consisted of her having her students copy a table from the book onto the board, or having students list the constitutional amendments.

This is why you come to an institution like Columbia--the depth of information and caliber of guest lecturers in this course were truly amazing.  As a previous reviewer mentioned, the scope of the course is ambitious, however I felt that it met the goals quite well.  By the end of the semester, you not only understand environmental issues from various perspectives, but have gained the facilities to act (part of the course involves learning to build informative websites).  The class is taught in three modules: Ozone Depletion, El Nino, and Global Warming.  Each module follows the same pattern: understanding the science of the issue, examining the history of the issue and related research, and analyzing the policy aspect of the issue.  Each module features one or two guest lecturers who are experts in the respective field.  While the guests are a nice bonus, Professor deMenocal alone makes the class worthwhile.  He is passionate about the subject and has an enjoyable, often entertaining, style that makes dense material easy to digest.  He is very approachable, answers all questions without making anyone feel foolish, and will gladly stay on a topic until everyone feels confident.  He is also extremely organized (I urge you to check out the course website) which makes lectures (all of which are listed in Power Point in advance) easy to follow.  Do understand, there is a lot of information conveyed in this class and you will be expected to know it in a fair amount of detail.  I found that the students in my section who did poorly were the same that attended sporadically and rarely participated in discussion.  However, many who did attend and participate regularly walked away with AÂ’s.  If you are looking for an easy way to get your science requirement, keep looking.  If you are looking for a stimulating, relevant course which is not just handed off to a TA, I highly recommend this one.

She helped us get to know the members of this group and then lead us into their ideas with informal but professional (highly interesting as well as informative) lectures. She seemed to choose her syllabus carefully and the (mostly) fascinating readings included biography, autobiography, articles by and about the group as well as novels. She also included a film (of Mrs. Dalloway) and a unit about art. We discussed art and philosophy and literature. She brought in fascinating guest lecturers as well. Throughout the course, she made an extraordinary effort to make sure we connected to the ideas we discussed. She said in our last class and I noticed all semester that she wanted the material to be relevant to our lives. When I visited her office hours she was interested and engaged and she helped my think more deeply about literature than I ever have before.

I dreaded going to this class. Professor Levin is nice enough, but she seemed more interested in talking about facts and grammar and less interested in making the material relevant to her students. Our discussions were awkward and stilted. While she wrote all over my papers, I felt her comments were unhelpful and her grades were inflated. Conferences with her were frustrating. When I came to her with an idea I was excited about, she said ""good"" and sort of nodded at me. I wanted to discuss my paper topic with her but she just seemed intersted in ending the conversation. She tried to discuss creative ways of structuring papers, but if I understand correctly the role of Barnard's first-year curriculum is to create an academic/scholastic foundation. This Kate Levin did not do. I wanted her to say ""This is the traditional method of structuring a paper"" and then say ""Now here are some more creative methods."" We never learned the traditional method. Goind to the writing center helped more than going to her. We watched the movie The Hours (we didn't read the book) and discussed its relationship to Mrs. Dalloway. One girl asked about the female relationships and ""the kissing."" Kate Levin's response? She talked about how Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell were sister so it was weird that they were kissing. I wanted to leave the room.

I won't rave about Professor Hamilton's teaching, but I won't disparage it either.  I found him to be a decent instructor and knowledgable about the Enlightenment, and he seems genuinely interested in what his students have to say.  However he expects the class to lead the discussion the entire time, which I think most of us found created a meandering and therefore not-so-helpful examination of the material.  He also tends to come across as a literary and social snob, openly putting down popular books that some of us enjoy, throwing french phrases into his speech without explaining them, and mentioning outside materials assuming you have read them.  I think he tries to be friendly, but it often comes across awkardly, so his good intentions end up rubbing people the wrong way. Don't expect a life-changing experience in Professor Hamilton's colloquium, but you can count on a pretty good reading list and a moderate and refreshingly creative workload.

I agree with most what was said about this professor already. If you are considering taking her class, no matter which one, be sure you know at least something about Middle East. Although she desperately tries to be coherent and organized, she presents new material in a very scattered manner so that at the end of this three-hour class I got totally lost in details of so many case studies. She once mentioned her first experience in teaching that after her first class somebody said that she cannot really teach. I think it is still true today. A detailed knowledge of Middle East does not make one a great teacher. Especially when a teacher asks other students about African countries that she lacks knowledge about. She also have a tendency to bring into the discussion cases that are not at all on the syllabus. She asks questions on them and you feel a complete idiot, because you have not even heard that there was such a case. Also, I really liked the discussion board questions, but the midterm topics were boring and not interesting (e.g. how much credit does the UN get in the process of decolonization? I think it is 35%--- Stupid questions deserve stupid answers. The readings are nice and interesting at times, but with the case studies like East Timor or Sierra Leone you really get lost in details and feel like the readings are not enough, so I had to go to some more material to get the grasp of the problem. 
Overall, the class is not really difficult, but I am not sure what I got more of it: a bogger mass or knowledge.

I agree with the previous review that you will love the woman, but hate the class.  I'll admit there were days when I absolutely loved the class, and then there were days when I felt completely overwhelmed by the sheer amount of work (much of which comes at late notice and is not listed on the syllabus) and my lack of comprehension.Yavari is truly inspiring.  I left class each day feeling energized and excited, having understood maybe one or two of her twenty or so significant points she made about religious authority--eventually becoming capable of relating the concepts to each other and understanding the ""bigger picture"".  For the first month, it appeared that the class had no idea what she was talking about, but we eventually got it.  She is very personable and takes an interest in her students, but at the same time I was absolutely terrified of her for most of the semester.  She's obviously a brilliant woman and knows how to impart her wisdom.  what truly annoyed me about the class, however, seemed to be her insensitivity to the fact that her students were taking other classes as well as hers.  For example,  she would constantly tell us there was not a single week's reading over 100 pages (very untrue) and that we should really do it all because it was so little in comparison to our other classes (not true, I had more reading for this class than for LitHum and CC).  I wold have rather she fessed up to the actual length of the assignments and admitted they were a lot.  Though there are no exams listed on the syllabus, she would occassionally give us a weekend's warning that there would be a small quiz the following week (though it is still a mystery to me how these quizzes--which took hours of studying facts and terms never discussed in class--were factored into the final grade.  At the same time, however, the quizzes forced me to relate concepts to each other and garner a greater understanding of Islam.
Also annoying was the constant, almost threatening reminder that attendance was mandatory for the 75 minute lectures twice a week as well as the 90 minute discussion section.  If you're not going to be present at lecture you are required to inform your TA of your absence prior to the class.  Her TAs are almost like groupies who clearly worship the ground she walks on.  Discussion section was a chore, but very helpful in trying to figure out what the hell Yavari's overall message is at the end of a lecture.  sometimes it was incredibly confusing to figure out what her purpose was.
That being said, this was my favorite class last semester.  I enjoyed the challenge Yavari presented, the way she made me look at the world in new ways (cliched but true), and her clear passion for teaching--when she told personal stories about her experiences, the class was particularly entertained and became well-informed in a real world kind of way. She expects a lot from her students, and she forced me to attain a greater understanding of the material.  I absolutely loved her.

The reviewer who referred to Sarris as a ""dotty old man"" is on the right track, but Sarris is actually a ""dotty old man"" who knows film and knows what he's talking about.  Though the class should actually be called European Film History instead of ""international"", the types of screenings were varied and well-chosen.  Sarris is a unique teacher in the film department because his expertise is critical, rather than historical or practical.  He looks at films differently from the other professors in the department and I was glad to have a professor who didn't gush over a film for it's beauty but would announce to the class why/why not he liked a film.  Yes, he rambles, and yes, he's hard to hear and sometimes incoherent, but you have to respect him and his opinions and he's sometimes very funny.  He encourages class discussion, asking our own reactions to the films screened.
At the end of the semester I was unsure whether I had actually learned anything: I don't think Sarris changes the way his students look at film/react to film/make films.  Instead he voices opinions and acts as a sounding board for his students opinions.  There is no reading for the class (not necessarily a plus, as reading would have provided me with some direction and feeling of accomplisment).  Discussions were laid-back and sometimes included screenings at the TA's discretion of material from outside Europe.
Overall, the main flaw from the class is it's lack of direction.  The TA basically said ""go write a paper about film.""  There was no rhyme or reason to any of the films screened and no overall messages or themes Sarris tried to impart.  But I'm willing to overlook all that and take more Sarris classes because he is a legend, has been around forever, and the few nuggets you get from him are brilliant.

OKay, so I'm not quite sure what these previous reviewers were thinking but there is no way that you could classify Rachel Mesch as a good professor. I hesitate to even call her a prof at all. She is ridiculously mean to those she forms a negative opinionof the first day (i wasn't one of them, but was appalled at her treatment of her least favorites) and basically uses the class to parade her VERY limited knowledge of french. I corrected her once because she was explaining a concept completely wrong and she just totally ignored me. The class was really easy if you were okay at French in high school, but if it's anything other than review i would switch prof's immediately. No one new to the material could figure out any of the grammer and she would get so angry when they all bombed the quizes. She assigns ridiculous group projects which make you feel like you are in 6th grade, and then chastises you for not taking it seriously, someone actually brought in playdough to show what french sculpture was all about, then we spent the rest of the class, yes, you guessed it, playing with playdough! FUN! although it would have been better without mesch. She's not a horrible person which makes me feel bad about writing this scathing reveiw i just felt i really needed to clear up the misleading reviews that were posted.

You could do far worse than Adam Mckeown for a CC professor.  He is definitely a bit awkward, but it would be unfair to say that he doesn't know what he is talking about.  He was definitely much more in his element spring semester.  He did a nice job of placing the readings in historical context and in relation to each other.  The notes that the other review refers to were often insightful and served to guide the discussions.  Because he allows a lot of student input, I would definitely say it's the kind of class where the students in it make or break it.  However, Adam was very enthusiastic and it was evident that he liked teaching CC.  His roleplaying and debates, though weird and not always successful, were testaments to his willingness to take different approaches in order to engage his students.

Without fear or favor (have graduated) and without any political axes to grind, I say without hesitation that Professor Massad was the best teacher I've had at Columbia or anywhere else.  I was lucky enough to have him for two classes (three semesters):  both CC and his Palestinian and Israeli Politics and Societies.  Perhaps more than anything, I admire and have been inspired intellectually by his unfailing, unflinching honesty about his own opinions and assumptions, and his equally unfailing and unflinching willingness to examine these opinions and assumptions with a critical eye. His lectures were uniformly fascinating, especially because it was obvious that he had complete control over the material -- he can field any question, and at a length that suggests that he's thought about it before. 
But what made the lectures even more fascinating was his enormous interest in them -- both personal interest and intellectual interest (some digressions -- the result, it seemed, of his enthusiasm -- were often the most fascinating part of the lecture!)
I know I will carry what I've learned from Professor Massad with me for the rest of my life -- both the content and the method.  -- And add to all this:  he's simply one of nicest people I know.

What makes StuartÂ’s class so interesting is how he relates Music Hum to the fundamental questions that create a bridge between every core class. Once one begins to have an understanding of some of the technical aspects of music the class searches to answer the greater questions. What does music mean? What is it trying to tell us? How does it relate to the human psyche? How does it relate to Society? How do we interpret music? Is there one meaning? Who creates the meaning, artist or listener?

I felt that his discussions were limited and that he lacked the ability to really delve into the literature.

 The whole world should have to take this class, not because the professors were especially godlike in prowess or physique, but because the loss of biological diversity is one of greatest environmental catastrophes happening today, yet its one that (with the proper motivation) we could seriously and realistically confront in all sectors.

David Bayer's class was a colossal waste of time, and he is an arrogant, pompous, condescending, disorganized mess as a professor. First of all, his presentation of the material is sloppy. He's so busy trying to sneak in stupid anecdotes from his time as a student or making political jokes (which are always innappropriate, but particularly irritating when you disagree with him), that he wastes a good portion of class time. He often makes mistakes on the board, and if you don't catch them then you're screwed. He also teaches the class as though he's talking to himself, as he scribbles away on the board babbling as if he's just working out a problem and we're not even there. He is so annoying, and the lecture is so useless that if you are going to class, you'd better double up on the Ritalin beforehand. Because of this, few people go to class, and fewer can sit through the whole lecture.
Homework is assigned, but not collected or graded and solutions are not posted. Same goes for sample exams, for the first midterm he didnt even post any samples; later on, samples were available but solutions were not. Basically, you learn nothing in class, you have no indicator of your progress or problems (since there are no quizzes/homeworks or solutions) until the individual exams, at which point 30-40% of your grade is at stake. While the material appears to be easy, Bayer is very sneaky and bitter about the lack of attendance in class, so he purposely creates traps for people to do poorly. Even if you walk out of an exam confident that you did well, don't be so sure. He also arranges the curve so that about 5% (maybe more) of the class will receive an F as a final grade (keep in mind, that Fs are irrevocable once assigned).
David Bayer does not use his class to teach Linear Algebra (Lord knows you don't learn it!) but to make a point. He thinks that since no one comes to class (which wouldn't be the case if he wasn't too lazy to grade problem sets or give quizzes) he should impose some consequence after the fact. While he doesn't know who anyone is in the class, he deals out this punishment blindly just to make an example of his students. He even came up with a complex scheme to catch people cheating which he devoted an entire semester to; perhaps if he put that much effort into teaching the course none of these other schemes would be necessary. He also has no respect for anyone who is not a math major (or something close to it). Overall, a stupid class, a horrible teacher, and an overbearing hidden agenda...avoid it like the plague.

This is a good class to flush out your schedule - its humourous, has virually no reading, the professor has some neat ideas, and the point of the assignments is to bullshit them.  Bulliet himself says on the first day the class is pretty much just BS - and he sure comes through on that promise.  The entire course has NO organization, and oftentimes Bulliet's rambings seem to be completely fabricated.  He has a lot of beef with Jared Diamond (Guns Germs and Steel) which I believe stems from the fact that when Diamond discusses the history of the wheel he doesn't cite old Dick despite the fact that he wrote the book on the wheel (and the camel, for that matter).  Though you might feel like the class is a crock due to its wandering, inventive nature, Bulliet's style of looking at history is truly inspiring.  He draws on a multitude of sources you won't find in more standard history courses - archeological theory, animal porn websites, classic literature, and modern day pop culture.  He is a living testamony to past history culture.

Professor Zetzel managed to take subject matter that's often dreaded by those bludgeoned through it as ""comparative law"" in law schools (or so I'm told by my sister, who was simultaneously taking a notionally similar course in the law school at another university) and bring it to life by demonstrating its integral place in the civilizations of ancient Greece and Rome, and connecting it to natural law theory.
As noted by reviewers of his CC sections, Professor Zetzel clearly knows far, far more about ancient civilization and the context of the subject at hand than he's able to display in any one class; yet, remarkably, he's entirely willing to answer questions with ""I don't know"" if he doesn't know the answer, which is of course entirely possible when one is discussing minutae of legal principles on the basis of garbled legal speeches from millenia past.
To be honest, like many others I signed up for this course because it had ""law"" in the title and I think, eventually, I'm headed to law school.  But, like most of the folks who showed up for the first two classes, I stayed -- though Zetzel's expectations are high and his method rigorous.  Will a grounding in natural law theory and an elementary grasp of how comparative law works get me into law school or serve me well as a lawyer?  I have absolutely no idea; probably not, if I had to guess.  But I would not have missed learning these subjects from Professor Zetzel for anything; he's just that good a teacher.

Professor Blackmar is a good teacher; she clearly knows a lot about the subject, has put together a good syllabus that seems to hit the high points of historical writing about the landscape without veering too far afield into urban studies, sociology, or political history, and has a large collection of slides relevant to the subject, which she uses to link her more theoretical lecture topics to concrete reality of the American landscape.
Unfortunately, a long lecture with extensive use of slides, in a midmorning class, is just going to make students fall asleep.  There's nothing to be done about it.  Couple this with what seemed like some nervousness in early lectures (odd in a professor of Blackmar's tenure) that had her continually interjecting ""um"", and what sounded like incipient laryingitis starting sometime around midterm (she mentioned at the end of one lecture that she had a cold she just couldn't seem to shake and hoped she'd be able to lecture at all next time!) and it's not too hard to see how the class could become rather painful for some students.
But the reading was great, and skipping lecture would have been pretty stupid: it simply isn't the same to read someone's academic writing on a given subject as it is to actually see extensive visual documentation of it., and there were some topics, like early suburban commercial development, that weren't covered in the readings at all.
I'd be curious to take a smaller course from Blackmar to see if the actual class time were more fun; I have to expect that it would be.  As it was, I was happy with the course and satisfied, though not overjoyed, with the lecture experience.

I can't say he made it fascinating, but he did at least make it manageable.  He actually slacked off a bit on the homework near the end which was unfortunate in that this is largely a grind class -- you just have to do a certain amount of mechanistic symbolic manipulation to understand the underlying semantics -- but fortunate in that by the end of the semester I was starting to worry that if he gave us another homework assignment like the first few, I could easily end up totally swamped.
He did seem to expect, at the beginning of the class, that he could work quickly through important principles (or the ""mini proofs"" which abound in this class) on the blackboard and that students would be able to follow along.  I think I was one of the better students in the class (at least, I got one of the better grades) and often I could just barely keep up; other times I couldn't keep up at all.  This is a common failing of mathematicians, of course: they tend to assume that they're talking to people who can make the same intuitive leaps that they can, but only the most exceptional new students of a subject will in fact be able to do so -- to his credit, Professor Helzner managed to get his pacing a bit more dialed-in by the end of the semester and take more time where the students seemed to need it.
I was a little disappointed by a late, strange change to the grading policy that recentered grades around and seemed to discard information.  I worked my butt off all semester; I didn't really appreciate the ""kindness"" of giving people a chance to lift their grades into the range I'd _earned_ by studying really hard for the final; oh well, instructor's discretion I suppose.
Workload:
This course is a lot of work.  I wouldn't expect that to differ from one instructor to another.  The first several weeks are heavy on long, painful exercises in symbolic manipulation (several hours each); after that it's mostly conceptual difficulties.  Two ""midterm"" tests, both quite hard; one final.  You'll work hard to get a B in this course; which makes sense, given that it's 4 points.

If you like probability, this is a good class. Ji Meng Lo teaches very slowly, carefully taking apart probability questions in a slow, step-by-step manner. He is a funny oddball of a man, and the class is a very interseting group of characters who are all really smart. at first, the class is very easy, basic probability questions about the probability of randomly picking such and such, basic stuff. 
The first midterm is a breeze, he even lets us have cheat sheets (two sided page). The 2nd half, however, might take a little extra work, the pdf's and the pmf's get quite complicated and by the end you have to put in that extra effort. If you get the math, you can get this class, and do well. Rest assured, the class is full of math majors so the average is high, so like they say, if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen. Class attendance was very high, too. I checked my problem sets online at other colleges, which was helpful. The book ain't bad either, but this class can get boring. If pdf's and pmf's and funny questions about randomly picking matches out of your pockets and figuring out which pocket is likely to have the last match, then you'll do just fine.

Prof. Seidel was, without a doubt, the highlight of my first year at Columbia. My first week at school, while talking to a few upperclassmen, I mentioned his name in connection with Lit Hum and they started raving about how great he is - and I wasn't let down.
The workload was relatively light, with a journal entry due at the beginning of every class and periodic papers. Anything you wrote for the class was returned with comments that showed the time Seidel devoted to reading the work. I always felt that my thoughts were being taken into careful consideration.
Discussion in the class was left up to you. Left to his own devices, Seidel could easily lecture for two straight hours - and would be more than happy to. He's a brilliant man and really knows his stuff about all the material; I rarely found myself bored in class and was almost never tempted to skip. However, he does like to lecture, so it's up to you to speak up if you have something to say.
Finally, I definitely recommend going to his office hours at least once a semester. I visited him on several different occasions and he was always more than happy to sit down and talk. He helped me to choose my second semester English classes, and I've already talked to him about taking his Joyce class in the future. I got nothing but great experiences out of this class. If you're lucky enough to be assigned to Seidel's ONLY lit hum section, enjoy every minute of it and maximize your opportunity.

I didn't mind the class while taking it. There was a bigger workload than most other UW classes, but it really didn't seem too bad. 
About halfway through the semester, though, I started feeling like a lot of the grading was very arbitrary. After one essay, Leora emailed the class to reassure us that she would follow the ""trend"" of grade inflation. At the end of the semester, though, I was shocked to see that my grade was lower than I expected rather than higher.
Be careful with this class. Even if a response seems insignificant, it will probably wind up being graded. There are rarely drafts on essays, so your first chance is probably your last. If possible, I'd switch profs. I didn't, and now I have to deal with this low grade in a supposedly easy freshman writing class.

This was my first German class taken at Columbia. Irene is a very sweet lady  - very understanding, but, in a very stereotypically German way (even though she's Austrian), won't accept things late, and MEANS it when she says she'll lower your grade if you have more than 3 absences.
Other than the responsibility of going to class, the class was very light. The homeworks were helpful (just enough to make you learn - not so much that it was excessive). Essay subjects were always presented with enough options to please everyone. Since Irene's teacher training I believe is for a younger audience, she does tend to speak a little slowly, but, the way I see it, you don't want a very fast speaker at this level anyway.

Professor May is one of the nicest professors that I have met at Columbia. The section I took was co-""taught"" by Professor Uemura, who is also great. Not only are both professors nice and approachable, the class is not bad at all. You have to do 2 labs per semester (one each half). Both have to be written up and one has to be presented in front of the class. Anyone that needs to take a physics lab should take this course. The physics is noticably harder than the other lab, but there is plenty of time to learn the new material, especially since there is only 2 reports. Attendance is not mandatory after you finish your lab (they actually never take attendance and I never came on time or stayed until the end of the class). Just show the professor that you can work in the lab and produce a decent lab report, and you will get an A, no doubt about it. They will explain anything about the lab or the report that you want and will even schedule extra time for you in the lab if you need it. I would recommend this class to anyone.

The AIS course is one of the most intensive courses. People grumble to high heaven about this class. Fact is, this course has 2 major parts. One is the theory about multimedia on the Internet. This stuff is all bleeding edge - so be prepared to google, read RFCs and chase down details. The second part is the programming part. You **have** to be very good in programming - particularly in threads, locking, networking ... all that low level stuff. You **will not** learn that here, rather the projects will expose you to them. The projects all build up to a software radio, which is a really cool thing to build. (Interviewers are really impressed to hear about this.) And you will become a battle hardened programmer at the end of it all. If you have not done this kind of programming before, then be prepared to spend 10-20 hours a week in the lab. It will be worth it.
Prof Schulzrinne is really into his stuff. He knows it inside out. Okay his lectures are not that detailed. But he is amazingly responsive via email (I got a reply back within half an hour - at 1am!). If you go to him prepared, then you'll find a knowledgeable and responsive person; if you go unprepared or ask stupid questions he will make you feel exactly that ... unprepared and stupid. Don't complain. Learn to deal with him on equal terms and you'll learn a heck of a lot in the class.

Yeah this course is pretty awful but because everyone does poorly in it its not too hard to get a decent grade in it, honestly.  The course material actually is pretty interesting but the lectures were just too basic and would simply skim the material whereas the homework and tests were VERY VERY HARD and you were lucky to receive any points on the homeworks.  It just doesn't make sense that the homework solutions don't even follow the methods in the book or methods given from the lecture.  The book is so worthless and the TA could barely do problems from the book.  The solutions to these damn problems were solutions that you'd have to have your phd in IEOR to be able to conjure up.  But everyone does poorly, honestly even the smart kids, so just go to every lecture and get all you can out of it and get through it.

This course is fantastic.  An education in economics, American history, or political science would not be complete without it.  As an economics student, I recommend taking this class after your core courses.  If you really want to get the most out of it, take a course in money and banking beforehand, too.  The class is rich with information, both in terms of historical facts and in seeing how economic theory is realized through events in American history.  From a history/political science perspective, the course offers Dr. Weiman's excellent insights into the growth and development of America and a ""new economic view"" of the events we've all heard of or studied before.
Dr. Weiman himself is a gem.  For students who pay the least bit of attention, his excitement about the subject easily inspires their own.  The readings he selects reinforce the text and delve deeper into the more important topics.  Overall, they're extremely interesting, though a few may be a little dry and empirical for the non-econ students.  Most importantly, he's a good teacher (and a nice guy to boot).
If you have the slightest interest in economics (in general) or American history, I cannot recommend this class highly enough.  It is easily the best overall class I've taken.
Workload:
Fairly heavy reading, especially including the optional readings that add extra oomph to the material.  But it's worth it.  The good news is, if a particular topic doesn't interest you, the reading is often skimmable.
Our semester, we had to participate in several online discussions about selected topics.  I've never really found online discussions to be interesting or helpful, but these weren't terrible.
There's a final paper assignment (~15 pages), done in pairs, on a topic in the economic history of New York City (chosen by you and your partner and approved by Dr. Weiman).  Dr. Weiman's helpful on every step of the paper, from topic proposals to research guidance.  Pick something interesting, because you will become a near expert in it by the end of the semester.
The midterm and final are very fair.  Standard ""8 questions, choose 5,"" short essay/long answers type of design.  If you've done most of the reading, or at least paid very close attention in class, you should have no trouble defending your T/F answer or explaining the significance of and relationship between two terms.

*** AVOID ****  The motto is Â“ItÂ’s not about what you learn, but what you already know,Â” which is obviously good for some, but bad for others. This is a woman who cares absolutely nothing about her students, their effort, or progress.  She will grade solely based on her liking you, and her liking you depends on the following:  (1) You have to have a perfect working knowledge of the Russian grammar, which means, if you are in this country for more than 2 years, you better have been attending a Russian school.   (2) You should have read most of the works on her syllabus prior to taking the class  (3) You must have an in-depth knowledge of the Russian History.

Instructor Miller is extremely intelligent, and knows how to camouflage her true feelings about her students.  Basically, she is fake.  Once you get on her bad side (for whatever hallucinatory reason she imagines-you will never know why), be prepared for her eye rolling and blatant staring while in a class.  
Barnard is chock full of professors who present extremely thought-provoking material and innovative ideas; however, Ms. Miller does not cut it; her self-consciousness is a tell-tale sign that she is very aware of her intellectual inferiority amongst masterminds.  Most of the ideas she presents to undergraduates have been published even before her time--needless to say, she underestimates her students.  And if you happen to have more brilliant ideas than Miller, you will surely be penalized.  
At times she tries to conjure up ideas of her own, but students usually get lost and confused by the 50 dollar words she uses in an attempt to mask the shallowness of her concepts.  Mind you, she would admit that even she doesn't understand what she's tried to explain.
In this particular class, most of the material selected was mediocre.  At times class discussions were manifestations of her own identity crisis, thusly the course was comprised mostly of books on ""passing"" and biracial issues.
One great thing about the class was that it attracted many wonderful students, and because of this fact alone, discussions were terrific.  
If you are looking for a Professor (not an Assistant Professor--as she is), who is unbiased and handles students and material fairly, might I suggest Professor Robert Hanning's 'Race and Racism' course.

The class simply sucked.  The lab notebook has at least a thounsand mistakes, and worst of all, the instruction team doesn't even bother to follow the notebook.
And then there's the problem of those TA's.  If you get one of those Chinese TA's, good luck.  At first we thought it was the language barrier, but after people communicated with them in Chinese, we realized that they're just idiots.  Some other TAs, however, were good.

First of all, attendance is required, and that sucked.  Jack is a funny guy, but other than that, the lectures are useless.  Weekly departmental presentations won't really give you much help in choosing your major.  Lectures are all focused on team development.
The lab sessions were dreadful, especially the matlab portion.  You could pretty much figure everything out by reading over the webpages, but Alex just loves to talk, so he almost always takes up the entire time assigned to him.
I (among others who had taken this class) would love to see them just take Gateway out of the requirement.  it's completely useless, except becoming friends with my gateway team.

oh man, this dude doesn't know how to teach!! yes, he is a nice old man but he was so dissappointing as a professor. I was able to tell on the first day of class he wasn't around school for a very very long time. I once showed up for his class 5 minutes late in the middle of the semester, and i was able to count 5 students in the classroom. As someone else mentioned, he specifically said ""counting is not my specialty."" Although reading off the textbook, he repeatedly made simple counting errors so many times. For our first miderm, he couldn't open the entrance door to the exam site that everyone started the 70minute exam 30 minutes late. Also, so many people were able to cheat during tests. 
Basically, professor Heyman wasn't prepared to teach this course. He is very out of touch with today's students and i wasn't really sure if he knew what he was teaching either. Don't get me wrong but this is not personal. He seems like a very nice man but not the professor you would want as a professor. I was so pissed at one point that I was going to petition the IEOR department for giving us such a horrible professor. This course probably has the lowest course number in the IEOR department, but SIEO 3600 is a pre-requisite course for almost all the other IEOR courses and the department shouldn't have ever try to experiment us with professor Heyman.

Josh is a terrible TA. On many occasions he would just refuse to provide help with problem sets, dismissively stating things like ""this problem is too easy for me to help you with."" On other occasions, like review sessions for exams, he just didn't know how to answer problems--problems on the practice exam that he was supposed to know.  Which would be fine on any occasion, except the night before the final exam, at the _only_ TA review session prior to the exam. Several other times, he was just plain misleading. For example, before our midterm, at the review, he specifically avoided questions having to do with the velocity of money and said ""don't worry, I've seen the midterm and that isn't covered, we don't need to focus on that concept."" Ironically, or tragically for those who believed him, there were _several_ questions pertaining to that particular concept on the midterm. So, he's either a vindictive little liar or he's just incompetent. Either way, he makes for a lousy TA. Josh is the sort of TA one would expect to encounter at a community college or in a continuing education program, but not at an Ivy League University. Shame on you Econ department!

Mr. Veneciano is by far the best academic disputator I have ever taken a class with here at Columbia.  He taught me during my first semester.  Being that I had too many splices in my thoughts, I earned a C+ in his class and secretly detested him for it.  But as my existence increased, my appreciation for his vigorous English teachings too increased.  I realized that the man taught me a common language, but to a higher degree; and he expects this degree to be reflected in the assignments.  The man does have fun in class gentlemen and ladies.  If you miss more than one class, eat food, take a nap, or hand in bad English he will cut your grade asunder.  The man runs a class for students not coasters.  So antone who feels like going to school and learning the correct way to speak and write English, take this guy's class.  But do not expect an A unless your papers are literally intelligible and cohesive.  So be it that I am older, I actually like the man because he taught me lessons which I can in return impress on other people.  By the way, practically the whole class suffered from a bastard of a grade that semester.  So if you are interested in learning English, as it should be spoken, then challenge the man.  Otherwise, the Veniciano English experience is not for you.

Gallagher is the most brilliant professor I have had so far. He doesnt use a book - in fact, writes up his whole course in notes that he copies and hands out, which is very nice, since you dont have to take any! His lecture style is very enjoyable - he lectures completely from memory, which adds some spontaneous insights and jokes to his lectures, and his 50 years of teaching experience make sure you have a great time in class.  Did I mention that his lectures are absolutely clear and reflect his unending love for teaching? There are, though, occasional mistakes in his lecctures/notes which he usually corrects immediately (instead of covering them up like some pretentious profs). In one word, a Gold Nugget.

I was looking through the other write-ups on Professor Ghezzo and realized that, with only a small number of reviews on the website, the truth of these reviews could be overlooked.  So let me convey to you again what my peers have tried before me: SHE IS AMAZING.  She's awesome.  She's an outstanding professor who truly engages her students.  Her eccentricity is the first thing you'll notice when she walks in (purple/black hair, extremely energetic, strong Italian accent), but as the class goes on you'll realize that you should be treasuring the classes because you know you'll miss her when it's over.  Someone mentioned earlier that despite our 6:00-8:00pm time slot, we loved going to class, and it's true.  There were times when she would talk a little too much for our taste, but to keep it in perspective, we wouldn't have wanted to talk so much if she hadn't gotten us so fascinated with the texts!  She did let us debate and discuss all the time (sometimes even about completely unrelated issues that we simply felt like talking about), and her knowledge of the texts was outstanding.  There were a couple classes where she even brought in guests to lecture who were experts on the specific texts, friends of hers from Princeton and elsewhere (she used to teach there).  Overall, if you manage to get her for Lit Hum, no matter what the time slot, BE GRATEFUL.  This is the kind of professor who you will want to join a group of you for dinner or a movie.  Her past students all wish we could take Lit Hum with her again, and a bunch of us are looking into her feminist Italian literature classes simply because she's teaching them.  Get into this class.

  A true scholar and artist, Mr. Weston is, in Nietzsche's words, one of those ""more nobly formed natures, who actually feel profoundly the weight and burden of existence,"" and this is evident to all from the first day.  That he values the ideals of the Contemporary Civilization course itself was made quite clear to everyone in my class; but we had to wait until second semester to really discover how far he was glad to push the most talented students.  To me, his expectations of his students seemed limitless--and with grace does he hold himself to even higher standards.  He has such faith in us undergraduates!   Let me explain all of this in more helpful terms: Mr. Weston is himself thirsty for knowlege.  He sees both the aesthetic and metaphysical power of philosophical concepts--as well as their necessity--and he, like few others, manages to convey to his class just how powerful these ideas are.  He also knows, if I'm not mistaken, at least five languages (yes, he's one of those).    Mr. Weston also has a great sense of humor.  But there's something to be wary of when it comes to his jokes: he usually means much more than he seems.  Not that the lighter things escape him, of course.
  Oh yeah, and almost everybody who had him last year totally adored him and felt indebted to him for his contribution to such an amazing intellectual experience.
  Our first semester pretty much went as planned.  Second semester was something else altogether.  Though we cut out Mill, we kept most everything else that comes in the standard CC package.  However, Weston added to the cannon Mandeville, Bataille, Foucault, Adorno, two extra essays by Kant, Benjamin, Debord, Samin, and Veblen, to name a few (there were many more).  It was absolutely mind-blowing.  The experience has changed me irrevocably.  If any of this excites you, and you're willing to do some extra (and invaluable) work, then check Weston out and see what you think.  But if you're already dreading the course,  and the idea of extra philosophy gives you panic attacks, then by all means, steer clear of this man!  If that's the case, though, you should probably just steer clear of the course altogether, right?

Prof. Harrist is a very thorough and clear lecturer who obviously knows everything about what he teaches and more. He doesn't joke or interact with students much, but he's receptive to questions.

She has a dry sense of humor at times but is very intelligent, accommodating as well as sensitive.

Like all the other reviews say, she's a very sweet and enthusiastic lady and clearly loves the material.  But, unfortunately, she is not a very organized or clear lecturer.  I came into this class with no previous knowledge of South Asia and was expecting a clear account of how Islam developed in the region.  Instead we looked at a lot of art work which was not interesting to me at all.  Her lectures had nothing to do with the reading and rarely covered any relevant material.  Overall I learned a lot from the class--but mostly by studying on my own for the exam (I basically reread ALL the material and taught myself the entire history she should have taught us).  I rarely enjoyed going to class and had participation and attendence not been such a great part of the class I wouldn't have gone as often.  Most times it was a waste of time, in my opinion.

Prof Gill is an ex school teacher who thinks of her students as high school kids. Contrary to what the below reviewers said, I don't think she expects much at all from her students except good grammar and all that high school bull. And her students oblige her by acting like school kids. I won't deny that the woman is pretty smart, but for a person whose focus is educational theory, she doesn't run a very good classroom. We students are supposed to lead the way in discussion, but the discussion inevitably degraded into inane crap about some student's experience last summer or something similarly stupid. Or, worse yet, for one of the last books we read (Paolo Freire's Pedagogy of the Oppressed), we spent the bulk of classtime calling out concepts that we didn't understand from Freire's work with her writing them on the board. We pretty much filled the whole board with Freire's confusing words - and then Gill didn't explain anything about them. All she did was to draw lines connecting words that were somehow linked together - but we didn't know what he damned words meant! The woman cannot teach herself out of a paper bag. And how are you supposed to take notes to that? Write down a bunch of words and draw some lines?

Overall, good teacher. Shlomo is personable, very accessible via email (to which he responds very quickly) and office hours, and more than fair with his assignments and exams. My only complaint is that I found his lectures unsatisfying. They were, for the most part, a recap/summary of relevant readings in the text, and general outlines of theory whereas I would have found it more interesting if he went into more programming details. Even so, this isn't really necessary-- you always learn best when you're trying to work out an assignment in front of the computer. Part of it, too, may have been that he was always looking to get the class to participate when no one was really interested-- he may have done much better if he just lectured.
Other good things about the course-- attendance to recitations is optional (no one went and the TA wasn't especially helpful), and although he said participation counted, he didn't seem to mind if people missed or didn't come to class (good for the independent learner).

Excellent professor. He's an animated and entertaining lecturer who covers a lot of concepts with in-depth and interesting examples and applications (e.g. counting poker hands during the probability lectures). Everything you learn comes from the lectures-- the text was more of a backup and for homework exercies, and since they go by pretty quick, I'd say you have to be damn brilliant to not have to show up. I'm no math genius, so I found the material pretty difficult-- he'd often cover proofs in class that wouldn't sink in until I went though my notes and thought everything through much more slowly (and even then some  never fully did). Even so, it certainly wasn't impossible to grasp the concepts and be able to do well on the homework assignments and quizzes. Exams were really challenging (all in-class, 4-5 questions), consisting of completely original problems that required you to apply in new ways the skills acquired from lecture. Your success on exams, in my opinon, will largely depend on your mathematical creativity-- how flexible you can be in applying the concepts you know to a problem that's pretty different from what you've seen before. In my case, the particular way of working out some exam problems just would never have occurred to me (how to begin a proof, where to go next after you've reached a point, etc.), especially under the stress of an exam, so I did pretty bad on them. But they're curved pretty generously, and if you do well on homeworks, you can still do well in the course (and hard exams are nice-- they really get you to think). More important, though, the class is always interesting, and I think (especially if you haven't taken a course like it) you'll find yourself much better able to look into a problem then before.

Not too bad. I think there were 5 bi-weekly problem sets (give yourself some time-- 2 completely devoted days if you procrastinate), 2 quizzes (easy), in-class midterm and final (difficult, for which more than a certain amount of studying just won't be helpful--which is a good thing).

you will thank your lucky stars, sophomores, when you see ""robert weston"" on your CC schedule after registration. winning the CC crapshoot, you'll begin come to class actually feeling guilty for not doing his assigned reading because you have just not fully taken advantage of one of the most brilliant CC teachers out there. unfortunately for me, i didn't have weston for CC the first semester, but after various recommendations through CULPA and his students, i managed to squeeze myself in for the second semester. i recommend every student who is unsatisfied with their original CC teacher to transfer to this class. weston speaks in a very eloquent and intelligent manner that suits the material that CC covers. he also likes to throw in a few German words here and there to better explain the many works that we read that we not originally written in english. in addition, he's refreshing - not your typical babbling arrogant grad student, but a down-to-earth who ironically likes to don himself in a sharp three piece suit and delicious looking ties. yes, he understands us... but he doesn't underestimate us. he expects a lot out of his students and his materials are very advanced, but these works are essential to western philosophy. and of course, you feel like you're getting more bang out of your buck. his papers topics aren't hard in the sense that some teachers give obscure subjects and leave you guessing, but that you feel pressure to prove that you've truly garnered something from his classes. about 2-3 papers per semester... not difficult. the hardest part of the class is to keep up with the massive readings, but believe me, you'll want to. i ended up getting an A-, the same grade that i got in my previous CC class, but i left feeling much much much better abt the Core experience. weston will revolutionize the way that you think.

Atila is one of THE nicest professors out there !! He's such an endearing character who is extremely approachable as well. I totally bombed my first midterm, and when I went to him to get my test back, he told me that it was okay, but that he'd be there to go over the test with me if needed. I studied my butt off for the final, which by the way was almost the same as the practice final, and ended up getting an A in the class. This professor defintely believes in redemption.

amir is great if you don't like going to class b/c he puts his lectures up online. honestly, this stuff is easy - if you have half a brain, you'll be able to learn the required chapters in less than a week. but, since we spend an entire semester, amir gives pop quizes (like 5 of them) scattered throughout the 3 months... all you gotta do is figure out when the quizes are and study for 15 minutes on 3 chapters right before the quiz. and you're set.
at first, amir was a pretty terrible lecturer, but i think he got better towards the end of the year. the class is huge, so he doesn't like to take questions, and to be honest, some of the questions asked by our fellow peers are so dumb. it'd help if he were more approachable by students about the company analysis project, but he's a young arrogant banker from smith barney. he doesn't hurt if you don't bother getting to know him and study your stuff.

I didn't have the negative experience with Gersten mentioned by most of the reviewers below.  Yes, the class is quite boring but I think the key is in reviewing the material and working on the homework problems prior to the lecture (all the HW and chapter assignments are detailed on the syllabus).  That way you get your money's worth out of the lecture.  Gersten really does have a sense of humor so if you can manage to stay awake during the evening class (and have reviewed the material), you should find it more or less enjoyable.  To make your life more pleasant, I would highly recommend a textbook other than the Sears, Zemansky, and Young.  The text is drier than the Sahara desert.  I consulted Cutnell and Johnson in conjunction with the Sears study guide and then went back to the Sears text to do the assigned problems.  Wouldn't have learned a thing otherwise.  As far as Gersten's attitude towards students, I found him to be extremely kind; he seemed to sincerely want to help students pass his class.  I also got help from Blaer who also, in my experience, was very keen on helping students interested in physics.  I actually borrowed his Cutnell and Johnson text.

This professor and his course are equally delightful.  I entered the course a few classes late, without any prior interest in/knowledge of Shakespeare, and ended up really enjoying myself and learning a lot. The papers, midterm, and final are exceedingly fair (the final was even on the easy side, since it was almost exactly like the midterm) - he only asks questions on the exams about passages we went over in class. You don't have to participate, but he will really, genuinely appreciate it if you do, and he never puts down a student if she gives an answer he wasn't looking for, or rambles, etc. He always finds a way to incorporate it.  And he makes it fun, which is hard for both professor and student at 9 am on a Monday in the dead of winter. I highly recommend this class.

(Note: my opinion is from the perspective of a CS major, not a premed / BME / BINF student.)
This course is a valid CS technical elective, but it's about as ""technical"" as Music Hum. The only use of a computer for this course is to type the weekly homework assignments, which are all essay questions. The course introduces you the various applications of IT to medicine, especially the hospital environment. Topics include electronic patient record systems, biomedical imaging, electronic order form, and disease classification standards. Each topic is covered by a different professor from Columbia's uptown campus; Shortliffe himself handles 5 lectures or so.
The material is quite interesting in a hands-on way--you get to see how the CS stuff you learn gets applied. As such, it often involves brief, simplifying revisits the traditional CS classes, e.g. Database and NLP and Computability. On the other hand, it also involves a lot of medical jargon unknown to CS students, which make up half the class. Although Shortliffe said that the course does not assume any prior exposure to medicine, the lecturers (again, med school profs) tend to forget that. But perhaps this is only fair, since the medicine people tend to find the CS stuff hard to grasp.
The class also touches upon social and political issues like privacy issues and Medicare, as well as the theory and history behind Biomedical Informatics as a distinct academic field. Overall, a palatable salad of things and a nice escape from programming.
Workload:
Weekly written HWs, about 2/3 pages each, check or no check. A comprehensive OPEN BOOK written final. Not terribly difficult, but the CS student may find giving opinions (as opposed to right/wrong answers) and the whole medical nomenclature vague and unfamiliar. Also, the BINF graduate students take the class very seriously, thereby screwing up the curve. You need to work towards a good grade, but this class is suitable if you like writing, if you like to see some real-life applications of your CS knowledge, or if you don't care about your grades (this is the only CS class in which you can b.s. your way to a pass).

Impressed by BalmerÂ’s extensive brochure-of-a-syllabus and encouraged by a genuine interest in the subject matter, I made the worst mistake of my academic life and registered for Religion and American Culture II.  Week after unbearable week I scribbled his immaculately organized PowerPoint presentations into my notes while languishing bored by his total dullness, and stark lack of analysis. Lectures read like the driest textbook, ""In 1900 this happened, 1902 this event.... blah blah blah blah.""  He had impressive credentials for sure but threw on a video (staring him) instead of lecturing on the topics of his expertise.  He never read any papers (a TA-only job) and never once did I find comments explaining my grades.  I've heard all sorts of horrors about his grading and fared pretty well at first. I got overall good grades (all A's) on all assignments until one.  Unfortunately, on one occasion personal matters conflicted with a due date and Prof. Balmer made an already shitty situation so so so much worse by being totally inflexible, unavailable and just plain mean. I managed to turn in a pretty good paper late (which really wasnÂ’t so bad considering the circumstances). On account of the tardiness of one response paper he thought it appropriate to drastically cut my final grade from an Â“AÂ” to a ""D"".  Grrrrrr.  So um basically..... DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS IF YOU HAVE HALF A BRAIN AND WANT TO DO MORE THAN MEMORIZE DATES!!!! (and if you do enroll pray for a tranquil personal life)

I want to hug Prof. Gordon.  She is a caring, articulate and intelligent radical woman.  She was a fair grader who always provided detailed, insightful comments that referenced each paper's specific strengths and weaknesses. She was lenient about due dates and unconcerned about people handing in papers late.  Readings were on the whole interesting (both the books and critical essays) and boring pieces could be skimmed or skipped altogether as assignments were pretty open ended.  Most of class was devoted to discussion and everyone was expected to participate. When she did lecture she was succinct, organized and offered interesting but not mind-boggling commentary.  I still enjoyed the course immensely which didn't altogether have to do with prof. Gordon; the class was full of smart, nice students who had great commentary.  I definitely give W&M the thumbs up.

That is not to say that Prof. Hua was deficient in any way, rather, the whole concept of consulting with someone wholly unfamiliar and uncoordinated with your research about how to present your work (which most probably wont be finished the second week of the semester when you are supposed to have your introduction prepared.)  Regardless, Prof. Hua was easy to get in touch with out side of class although I did not find her limited comments helpful in anyway.

McKenna can be a real asshole, but he is one of the best professors I've found at Columbia.  His nothing-sacred, determinedly un-PC attitude can be off-putting, but if you can't deal with some obnoxious people, why are you in the film industry anyway?  Once you get past his demeanor and car metaphors, however, he is a brilliant guy with a ton to offer.  I learned more in the first week of his class than in all the Creative Writing Program classes I've taken combined.  He rarely lectures, and instead spends most of the time workshopping students' work in a very collaborative atmosphere.  He scares off all the dilettantes in the first class by talking about how he doesn't believe in grade inflation, so his classes are filled with serious, motivated writers, and he tends to bring out whatever is wild, nutty, lecherous or ridiculous in the class.  This is the only class I've had where students voluntarily stayed late because we weren't done talking!  His class becomes like a little family by the end of the semester--the Osbornes.  I have taken both his Barnard and Columbia classes; the Columbia class had film grad students in it (who said it was better than their grad classes) as well as people like myself who aren't even film majors.

I totally agree with the previous reviewer: this class is a waste of time. Basically, you can get away with doing nearly no work (reading about two of the plays will get you through the midterm and final), and you're not given any motivation to read anything either. Stewart doesn't lecture and spends most of the class asking people what they think. Honestly, why would you take a lecture if you wanted to only hear what the other students thought (generally the same 5 people talking) as opposed to the professor? He can't control the more obnoxious students who interrupt him and tell useless stories about their Uncle Herman or how this and that passage was really funny. He's too nice to tell them to be quiet. As for his essay instructions, it's utter rubbish. He gives single sentence instructions and docks lots of points for you not giving him what he wants. If you go see him in office hours, he'll tell you what he wants and then dock points for you giving him what he wants, claiming that it WASN'T what he wanted in the first place and that he really wanted what he originally told you he wasn't looking for. Stewart is obviously not very interested in Shakespeare or at least he displays a total lack of enthusiasm for what he teaches. Don't expect to learn anything from this class. If you take it, don't bother going to class--basically nearly half the class was missing during each lecture towards the end of the semester.

A very nice professor who cares enough to learn everyones name in the relatively large class. 
But I don't think she was born to teach. She is very well prepared in that she has everything on powerpoint, but she's not so great at answering questions that aren't in the powerpoint plan. She's also rather bad at coming up with good test questions, asking students to go through every step of an algorithm that is easy for computers, but painfully tedius for humans, and making that worth almost half the midterm. (And giving a full blue book for it).

The good:
Peter Allen is a very talented lecturer. His handouts are spectacular. They present each topic very simply and completely, making reading the horrendously boring textbook almost completely unnecessary. Even though sometimes the material is a bit dry, Prof. Allen manages to keep the lectures interesting and bearable. I don't know what other reviewers are talking about when they say he humiliates students. I never remember him disparaging any student. 
The bad:
He did have a tendency to misunderstand students' questions and assume they were asking simpler questions than they meant to, but he was always patient and treated all questions as worthy of asking. Also, get comfortable when he starts to walk through an example, because he'll take you through the WHOLE thing, even if the process is the same in the first 10% of the example as it is in the last 90%.
If you take this class, be prepared to work. This was the most work I've ever done for a class. Ever. The theory questions are usually reasonable, but the programming is killer. It wasn't uncommon for me to spend my entire weekend working on an assignment (even with no procrastinating). There's a lot of work, but I think it was worth it because after you walk out of that class, you will be extremely well prepared for programming in Java and comfortable with the data structures discussed in class.

Overall, I highly recommend taking this class with another professor if you are looking to receive an A in the class.    Read the other reviews if you are curious of what students do not like or like about him.  They are pretty accurate besides for the newest one.  I  only wish to talk about his grading system, which has major problems because he does not grade on scale.  Instead, he averages all the grades together and makes the class average equal to a B+.  An A- is one standard deviation above the average, an A is two standard deviations above the average, a B is one standard deviation below the average, and a B- is two standard deviations below the average.  The problem with this is that the chances of a person  achieving a grade 2 standard deviations above or below the average is incredibly small in a class with about 15 people of similar intelligence.  This means one can work their ass off and still not achieve an A or one can do a half-
ass job and still receive nothing lower than a B.  If you do not really care about obtaining an A, then you will not have any issues with the grading, but this is not really fair for people that work hard and know a lot.  In addition, Brian bases 20% of the grade on participation.  However, he grades down for talking too much, which basically makes 20% of your grade based on how much Brian likes you.  In conclusion, even if you know everything there is to know about political science, you will have no chance of receiving an A unless Brian really favors you.  If you are slacker though, this is fun summer class to take.  
Workload:
If political science is going to be your major, you should try to read as much as possible; otherwise, the readings are really unnecessary because they will not affect your grade.

Oh, where to begin with Prof. Golston? The man has one of the most interesting personalities you'll find in a department filled with aging eccentrics and young assistant profs with varying degrees of insecurity, and that's saying something. Quite simply, he's fun. He knows what he's talking about - he had personally met nearly every poet (Charles Bernstein, Lyn Hejinian, Susan Howe, John Ashbery, and others) on our syllabus, and often broke out with random exclamations or comments in class that would resound through the staid corridors of Philosophy Hall. Don't let his vibrancy fool you, however - Golston is smart, critical, articulate, and genuinely interested by both the material and what you have to say about it. You can't sleepwalk through this seminar - he'll make you talk even if you don't want to. Since Golston's specialty is avant-garde poets and poetics, you're not going to be reading easy stuff - one of his favorites, Clark Coolidge, wrote entire poems filled with conjunctions and prepositions. Basically, this is the only class in the Department where you read anything really experimental and postmodern. The material, therefore, is pretty hard and can take more work than you might think at first, but it's worth it just to see Golston get so worked up about the readings. You'll be surprised how engaged you are by the end of the class - I, a self-professed hater of poetry, grew to enjoy the material and the professor quite a bit by the end. He's also exceedingly nice and willing to talk during office hours. Take a class with him; even if you're not interested in the material, you're sure to be won over by his personality and will probably come to enjoy whatever he teaches.

Not too bad - two papers, one 3-5 and one 5-10, plus response papers. He wants you to talk, but also spends a fair bit of time introducing each poet. He's a fairly strict grader in a department that hands out A-s like they were Kleenex, so you'll have to work to get a good grade. But he's always willing to look at drafts and rewrites.

Pepe is great and certainly not a jerk.  He may assign one or two more assignments than other teachers, but it's well worth it for the substance of the class.  In my opinion, languages (especially at this level) are pretty mindless; since the department has a set curriculum, there is little room for the professors to stray from the text book.  However, Pepe makes class incredibly interesting. Yes, he makes fun of people, but it's all in good fun and his favoritism does not play into grading.

These movies are not all appropriate to an intro class, but we watch them because Larry wants our generation to see them (he tells you this on the first day of class).  I want to be a film major, and I couldn't stand the other film majors in the class.  Larry caters to the 3% that already know everything you're supposed to learn, and calls on the same 4 kids as they snicker over the absurdity anachronistic mis en scene! hahaa!  The class is just really impersonal and NOT a good introduction to the film dept.  Discussion sections are hit or miss, but mine was actually awesome, thanks to Daniel Falcone (loved him!).

Required class for the major/minor, so you'll most likely have to take it.  DOn't take it for the science requirement, it's a lot of work.  But you learn an incredible amount, so defintely worth it if you're interested in the topic.  Kushnir has an accent, talks softly, but his slides are good.

I would definately skip this professor if possible.  In my opinion, He is basically a snob who looks down on all of his students.  He gets great joy out of trying to make you feel stupid.  Even if you go to all of the classes and study a lot, you will not do well unless you have an art background.  He will tell you that the tests will be a reflection of classwork... its a lie.  He will find some obscure detail you merely brushed over and then have you write an essay on it.  Find a kinder way to complete this requirement if at all possible!

I honestly really enjoyed Prof. Bayer's class.  True, you can get through it with a good grade without understanding linear algebra if you just learn a few tricks and study past exams.  But if you do want to learn the material, Bayer teaches it.  And explains it in several clear, logical ways in addition to the standard book method.  I'm not a math major, but I was interested in the subject and he treated me with nothing but respect.  Then again, I went to class and didn't try to cheat.
Overall, Prof. Bayer's a odd but pretty entertaining guy.  I'd go to class wondering what today's very quotable random aside would be.  If you need to take the class, you can get by without a huge effort.  If you're interested in the subject, you can learn it in his class's much more relaxed atmosphere, provided you don't depend on either just the lectures or just the text.  
Workload:
Two midterms and a final.  And yes, one problem can really cost you.  But if you budget your time, Bayer has explained the material well enough for you to know several ways of checking each problem.  So it's definitely possible to leave the test room and be confident you got 100% (and be justified in that confidence).  And you'll know what you're getting into; he gives plenty of info about the tests.  
Very reasonable curve for the final grades, which you can get the gist of from his website for previously taught courses.  No homework, which can be a good or bad thing, depending on your perspective.

I took Liz's Lit Hum class in Spring 2002 and feel compelled 2 years later to sumbit a review of her because she is one of the few professors at this school that I will search out in the class directory.  Other professors should have to sit and observe the way she handles students--never shooting them down, always responding enthusiastically to questions.  She almost convinced me in Lit Hum to major in Classics.  She has NO ego--none--and that is so refreshing for a professor at this school.  It took me until my senior year to realize how rare it is at COLUMBIA to find a teacher who realizes that what she knows is less important than what her students actually learn from her.  And on top of that, a lovely lady outside of the classroom--always friendly, but not in a haughty or corny way.  She's just a down-to-earth person and a truly excellent teacher.

Believe all you've heard. Yes, Daniel Cooper is a very nice man. Yes, the class is easy. True, it's often boring. But for those of you who are shopping for a pretty enjoyable and not-too-painful filler class, I recommend Evaluation of Evidence. I'm an Econ major and I took this class in Spring 2003 to pad my schedule. It's that rare easy, breezy elective you're always looking for and can't ever seem to find. First of all, it's very easy. Obviously the ready can get heavy considering it's an intro level sociology course, but it's always manageable and it's also not at all hard to tell when it's important to read and when it's not. There are five books - three of which you have to write about book-report style. One's required, the other two are your choice. 'Nuff said. Read three if you want. The truth is, most of the material's actually pretty interesting even if Cooper's presentation leaves you cold. Though he's likeable enough, he definitely has the ability to lull you to sleep with his monotone delivery and bland lecture style. I say take the class for the Durkheim book on suicide, if for no other reason. That's really just a fascinating piece of work. This is also a class I skipped out on more than a few times and managed to get an A in anyway. 
So, take Cooper's class when you have other, tougher coursework to tend to and are searching for the fifth course that won't break your back.

Prof. Taylor is one of the most intelligent, articulate and understanding professors I have encountered at Columbia. Although the concepts are not particularly complex, she explains everything slowly, clearly and in the most simple way possible. She even posts her lecture notes online so that you know what she thinks are the important points. Her lectures are straight-forward and enjoyable, filled with entertaining stories about her kids, interactive games and interesting videos. She allows tons of time for discussion and gladly answers all questions, even when they are about Student A's cousin Bob or Grandma Milda. She is extremely personable and easy to relate to because she is the type of woman who, for example, doesn't give cummulative exams because she ""hated them when she was a student"". More than any Prof. I have had, Taylor comes off as a ""real person"", with errands to run and kids to deal with. Sometimes she's in a bad mood and sometimes she's busy. So are the rest of us. She may not have handed back the midterm until two weeks before the final, but the exams were not cummulative! Having it back any earlier wouldn't have helped. My advice: Take Intro with Taylor!

It definitely takes time for Derrick to grow on you. Initially I wasn't sure if I like him or not. He can be amusing, but I definitely think he demands more from you than your average TA. As a freshman, that can be daunting, but you learn to give him what he expects. He's tougher on your first paper, just to show you that you have to put in work to get a good grade, but effort is rewarded in his classes.

While his lectures are usually entertaining & interesting, don't be fooled by this kind looking man.  He is one of the most brutal graders I have ever come across.  His TAs didn't really help much either.  At a review session for the final, they answered every question with ""We don't know"" or ""We can't tell you that"", and it was an absolute waste of time.  Professor Krauss says that he'll curve grades, but the curve really does nothing for your grade.  He doesn't assign a set of books--instead, he assigns one book on a list of recommended books and says that the other ones are boring on the first day.  So, naturally, students don't read them.  Then when you start questioning where the random material on his exams are coming from, he asks you how come you weren't doing the readings.  He also assigns lengthy articles online to read.

There's one thing to be said about this professor; he's terrific.  Chad is, absolutely, without a doubt, a brilliant guy.  Moreover, coupled with his intelligence, he also possesses sincerity and humbleness.  These two underlying characteristics make him a very compelling teacher and friend.   His humble character resonantes within his teaching style and personal conduct. He will never make you feel dumb for not knowing something and he will always explain complex or otherwise foreign ideas in ways that appeal to ones understanding.  He demonstrates various ideas and philosophies in such a way that is lucid and relevant.
     His preparation and dedication are also amazing.  On the first day of class, he provides 7 CD's filled with Music for you to copy at home.  Before the Final and Midterm he provides extensive review sheets that go over the major items that you must know.  He is also willing to meet with anyone at nearly anytime to discuss the ideas for however long.  His reading assignments are concise and brief and he will also make it a point to go over the important concepts and highlight them, so if you missed everything else, he will give you the core ideas.  He is hillarious in class and never, ever has an uptight demeanor about him.  I always felt like he was an older friend or brother just teaching me about something he knew very, very well.  I honestly do not know how anyone could possibly give Chad a negative review, and at this point, after the class is over, it doesn't behoove me to kiss up or fabricate things; I say this with complete sincerity.  His enthusiasm for his subject and teaching is resoundingly clear.  Even a casual observer of this class will realize Chad's passion for Music and helping people understand various ideas on it.     I came into this class with a very meager knowledge of what we were studying and a very distant appreciation (if not an aversion) for what we were listening to.  However, by the end of this class, I listened to the CD's he gave us routinely.  I am even exploring certain things we discussed in greater depth.  I owe an incredible debt and gratitude to Chad for teaching me a new way to think of things.  He's a great guy just to talk to as well.  He has a lot of interesting ideas.  I'd highly recommend Chad without any reservations whatsoever.

Professor Miron has tremendous  presence in front of a class.  He speaks in sober, measured tones with great aplomb.  When he comes into class, he lays a small page of notes in front of himself and talks straight through the end of class, although this is not a negative.  On the contrary, I had the feeling that every sentence contained some morsel of wisdom or profound insight gleaned through his decades of contacts with Zionist leaders from Ben Gurion to Sharon.  Prof. Miron is highly balanced.  Until the last week of class, he managed to keep his lectures from revealing any personal opinion, and that was only breached during the last week because the final classes were open debates where we were able to ask for his opinions, point blank.  He is not a difficult teacher either, with the workload consisting of relatively light readings and one paper.

In my opinion, this woman should not be teaching: the only good thing about this course was the textbook - it was really good (though not elementary) but you can read it without taking the course.
Viviette Ancona just does not know what teaching process is about, what and when should be done, what structure is appropriate for an exam or a problem set.  Besides, there was not a SINGLE problem set without an error (like missing or wrong data).  You can only guess what she means when she formulates questions. 
With all these annoying things, she is also too old and too nice/naive to get really angry with her - so if you take her course, prepare to take it with humour.

Professor Delbanco is an incredible and dynamic speaker.  Much of the class is historically-based, and Delbanco takes great care in drawing the class into the time period during which each text was written and explains the progression of literature from the Puritans to novelists of the 19th Century (particuluarly Melville, Delbanco's love).  Some of the reading can be a bit dry, but Delbanco's lectures and the mandatory discussion sections led by TAs make them worthwhile--Delbanco shows that there is always something valuable in even the driest texts, if not in the writing itself, in the history behind it.

Reviews of Meng Laoshi seem to fall into the category of either 'Meng hater' or ""Meng lover' which can be confusing for someone reading these posts.  My opinion is that there are three different types of student who take this first-year language class, and depending on which one you fit in, you will definitely either love or hate Meng Laoshi.  I'll give you my spin on these types, and hopefully you can figure out if she is the right teacher for you.  Because it's important, and will totally determine your chinese learning experience.  
Three types of people enroll in this class: (1) kids who grew up with chinese in the house, and can speak either a lot of a little, but can't read (2) kids who already know another Asian language, such as Korean, and (3) kids who are totally new to Chinese, and have no background in either (1) or (2).
If you belong to category 3, and I want to make this very clear, you will learn 3-4 times slower than the kids in the first two groups.  Language teachers and linguistics have shown this, and it just makes sense.  This shouldn't be a reason to get discouraged or not want to study chinese -  in fact, you'll work harder, improve faster than the other kids, and will get more excited about the language.  Also, as someone who has already completed 2nd year Chinese, I can say if you work hard and stick with it, you'll be kicking those other kids' ass by the end of 2nd year, which I am now.
So, what is important about first year, if you belong to group (3), is a teacher who understands the different backgrounds of students, and someone who will help you not feel frustrated or stupid, because you are OF COURSE learning slower than the kids with either family backgrounds or another Asian language background.  This is REALLY important, because especially in the first year, everything will be so new, you'll often feel like you can't do it, if all these other kids are seemingly finding it so incredibly easy.  THIS IS NORMAL and you shouldn't give up, because a year's worth of hard work will make up the difference.  Also, if you study hard, you can definitely earn an A, even with the other kids' having a great advantage.  It's no a curved grade class - just do your work and you'll be totally fine.
As for Meng: Meng is the embodiment of the teacher who only is interested in her students who already have some background in Chinese or another Asian language, and will make the students who don't have this feel inadequate and dumb.  In fact, this is so idiotic because one's background has no bearing on one's intelligence.  I simply cannot understand why Meng favors the students who simply already can either read characters or speak Chinese; the only explanation is that she is an easily frustrated and lazy teacher, who doesn't want to help students who actually need it.  
Examples: in class, she will often cut off a struggling student, regardless of how hard they are trying, and ask a student who already knows how to speak chinese, to read a passage.  Invariably she will call on a student that she, for instance, SPEAKS TO IN CHINESE after class, and a student who so clearly grew up with Chinese in the house, often speaking it.  Also, once we wrote essays for a homework assignment, and Meng read a section from a particularly good one, praising its ""fluency"" and naturalness.  Now, this is fine, except for the fact that this student already is fluent in chinese, and thus, will not find it hard to write an essay that is idiomatically correct when he or she has grown up with it.  Meng made the rest of us feel inadequate because we couldn't do this - but frankly, after only 9 WEEKS of class, it would have been impossible for any of the rest of us to write a fluent essay.  Obviously.
Meng simply doesn't register these differences.  She simply does not account for different backgrounds, which again, I feel is beyond idiotic.
But again, none of this should keep you from studying chinese if you fall into category (3).  Just don't do it with Meng - there are MANY other teachers who teach Chinese 1, who treat all students the same, and go out of their way to help students who are struggling with the inevitable problem of learning a new script language, if you are coming to it totally new.  You will not feel stupid or inadequate - rather you will work hard, because your teacher will show you that it's the only way to learn the langauge.  
Finally, if you do fall into category of (1) or (2), I'd watch out also.  You might get rather complacent with your advatnage, and bask too much in Meng's glowing praise of you, which is something you have only earned through either accident of birth or accident of former study.  You may get lazy and not work hard enough.  I can say, now in Chinese 3, all of those kids are paying now, having fallen behind kids like me, who struggled first year and got flustered by Meng Laoshi, but now am doing far better than the kids who grew up with it.  Meng will make you feel smart when you haven't earned it, and may in fact keep you from working hard enough to get good at the language.  You'll pay later if you fall into this situation Meng creates.

Erik is not only an exceptional intellect, but also a marvelous teacher.  He handles the difficulties of Ancient Greek without sacrificing clarity or time; the class finished all the course work in a timely fashion and with a very complete understanding of the language.  He is not an easy teacher, but he is remarkably fair and rewards students greatly for their efforts as well as their performances.

Maxine isn't entirely bad, esp. not if you really enjoy a lighter work  load and missing class.  If you go everyday, you're likely to be bored to pieces with her tangents and extremely uncorrelated asides, but if you're like me and traverse to lecture less you'll get to know what you need to  without the hassle of some more intense instructor.  Remember* anthropology is a very interesting and all-encompassing sort of field- so if you're looking for a really structured, informational type lecture and don't receive it in Maxine's course, it's not her fault.    As for the material: fascinating beyond belief - if you read the book, common sensical and unimportant, if you just attend Maxine's lectures without reading.  As for the reading, the packet has some great stuff: Said, Ortner, etc. I recommend this course and teacher  to people that are interested in gaining a less stressfully attained, yet still informative  knowledge about at least the surface of cultural anthropology.

Undeniably adorable but a little incoherent at times.   Sometimes you will leave class thinking, ""What did we DO today?  Did we learn anything?""  You will be baffled as to what to take notes on.
Other times, however, she will surprise you with her clarity.  That happens too.  It is a hit-and-miss type deal.
However, all in all, if you're at all interested in learning the basics about psychology, this is a good bet.  Except for the essay take-home (which you can do with a partner), the only tests she gives are multiple-choice and straight-forward.  That is to say, if you put the time in and learn the material, the test is easy... if you skim it the night before, it ain't.  
Also, this class is really really funny.  Many of the videos that she shows in class are laugh riots-- not all, but many-- and during the developmental psychology unit, she will bring in a baby.  You will watch the baby chew on her doll.  Graham will try to measure the baby's head... that won't work.  If the baby has a favorite song, the class will be coerced into singing it for the child.  
This is a fun class.  Keep up with the reading and form study groups for exam prep, and you should do fine.

I took this course in the spring 2004 (Pre-Hispanic Societies).  If you want a thorough and in-depth study of the Mesoamerican and Incan societies, this is the course you want to take.  Starting with and overview of both societies and a subsequent study of each region and each society, first  with the Olmecs of Mesoamerica, the Teotihuacanos, the Toltecs, the Mayans, etc. , the class studied not only the peoples, but their arts and artificats, their writings, their astronomies, customs, cultures, and religions.  It was no less so with the societies that predated the Incas, those of Chavin, Nazca, Tiahuanaco  and, ultimately, the Incan Impire and its disintegration after the arrival of the Europeans.  If your desire is to learn, up close, about these wonderfully developed societies that equalled and, at times, surpassed that of ancient Egypt, yes, yes, yes, do take this course.

Besides the books assigned, almost on a daily basis, there was a plethora of addition materials distributed to the class that served to expand on the class discussions and assigned texts.  Additionally, there were documentary videos that depict the results of archeological digs, ancient games,  and the magnificent artworks of the societies studied.   Yes, there was a lot of material, but without it we could not have gotten such a comprehensive study of these ancient Latin American  socities.  The professor always kept the class interested and talking about the different aspects of the materials being studied at any moment.  You would certainly not fall asleep in this class.

I am still taking this course, but I felt that I just had to say something about Greet.  This is the second part of Elementary French and, naturally, most of us are far from being fluent.  However, the amount of French that we have learned in this intensive summer course is tantamount to what one would learn in a whole year.  Greet is as enthusiastic a professor as I have ever met and during the two hours/day  four days a week that we meet, she keeps the group involved and constantly talking and discussing the nuances of the language.  I would absolutely recommend Greet van Belle if you really, really want to learn French.

I regret having taken this class. The material is narrow and limited for a class entitled ""Modern Poetry"".

I had Liz as my Lit Hum instructor 4 years ago.  At the time, I thought she was not a good instructor, but most of the rest of my class liked her, so, hey.... In retrospect, I still think she was a poor instructor.  
Liz has very set very basic opinions about the texts.  If you repeat these opinions, she loves you and thinks you are a genious.  Note that I said her opinions are basic.  This meant that those of us who talked a lot without having read the texts got high marks in her book.  Those of us who didn't b.s. or who actually said something insightful were worse off.  In my opinion, once Liz decided if she liked you, everything you said was gold.  If not, well....
I felt that whenever I personally spoke to Liz she talked down to me both in terms of tone and content.  She also did so when I spoke in class.  One day when I made a very basic comment about a text, she walked over to me at the end of class and said ""you did a very good job of the reading this week.""  I felt like a complete idiot.  Whenever I or one of her other nonbeloved students tried to make more insightful comments, she told the class that she did not agree with us (and it got to the point where she was disagreeing with things I had learned as fact in other classes).
Liz and I had a personality clash that made me HATE Lit Hum.  But Liz has no idea that we had that clash.  Her personality overtook the class and made it quire painful.

Prof. Somerville is without a doubt the best professor in the religion department and one of the best and most underrated undergraduate professors at Columbia. The only reason I can come up with that people think he is boring is that they are simply uninterested in the material. If you have more than a passing interest in Christianity, the class is a must. Somerville made me a religion major by presenting thoughtful, intelligent analysis of the roots of Christianity. He's a giant in his field, and with good reason: he knows his stuff and communicates it well. Taking something from this man should be a requirement for religion majors, and strongly recommended for everyone else--these are the types of classes we came to Columbia to experience.

Simply put, this man is brilliant and teaches some fantastic courses. The common complaint among the detractors on this site seems to be that he doesn't grade his own papers. This is true, but it hardly takes away from the experience of hearing one of the leading scholars in American religion lecture twice a week. If you are not interested in American religion (particularly American Christianity and evangelicalism, since that is where Balmer has done most of his groundbreaking work), you will not enjoy this class. However, if you are a religion major or have more than a passing interest in the state of religion in America, the class is a must. His credentials as a researcher in this field are nearly unrivaled, and he is passionate about teaching undergraduates. For those people who think he is arrogant or disinterested, try demonstrating genuine interest in what he's saying. I once went to his office hours to ask about a paper and ended up talking about Bush and religion for about an hour because he was so glad to see a student who actually cared about what he was talking about. Don't take the class for an easy 'A'; it's an insult to a great professor. Take it because you'll learn something from one of the greatest Columbia has to offer.

LISTEN TO THE TERRIBLE REVIEWS AND DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS! I'd say this class is horrible only it's hard to say since I attended only 50% of the lectures, and the ones I managed to sit through usually involved a nap or a newspaper (these times often ended with Prof Burgstaller asked me if I was comfortable or feeling OK, he also once asked me why I never come to class but he seemed to accept my answer that I never go to any of my classes -- which is such a lie).  If you are going to take it anyway, study from the textbook - its pretty clear and actually somewhat intersting, and just reference the lecture notes to make sure you havent missed any major topics.  You can't pull an A without coming to class (unless you have previous knowledge of the material), but you won't fail either.
I do have to say that Prof. Burgstaller is a nice guy, and fairly accomadating.  You may never see him outside class, but he will call you in response to an e-mail, and was really nice about extensions on problem sets for religious holidays etc.  He's also infurating though in that he's speaking english, but you cant understand a word that comes out of his mouth.

This was a good class overall.  Attending lectures is not neccesary, nor is reading the book, because the lecture notes are all posted online (this may not cover 100% of the material but it comes pretty close - enough to pull off an A of you really know the lecture notes well).  However the lectures aren't that bad - I fell asleep sometimes but while I was awake they were pretty interesting, and attending lectures definitely did help make studying easier.  The material is definitely intersting also, its the type of stuff you'll find yourself repeating to your friends as in ""hey wanna hear something cool I learned today?"" or ""ya know how we though Jake and Lisa had a really screwed up relationship bec they fight all the time? well I learned . . .""

The class is defnitely informative, though the overall structure could be improved upon. In the lectures, she basically gave an introduction and outline to the topics, and left the rest to us, which sometimes felt like a lot of holes to deal with.

Brian Murray was one of the best professors I have had at Columbia. I apologize to everyone who can't believe that, because of the fact that Brian occassionally uses a short hand to explain his theories. Not only was the class material presented in a clear, understandable way, but Brian was also very available outside of class to discuss the material. It involved a free lunch or dinner. Many reviewers complained about the grading system in this class, personally I didn't think this was a big issue. 
Just go to class, do the readings, and don't try to teach the class to show off how intelligent you are. Brian Murray overall was a fantastic teacher, and in my opinion he gets a bad rap on CULPA because the 2 or so students who disagreed with his theory/teaching style decided to post terrible reviews.

In one word: wow. Like other reviewers, I came to this class thinking I would have to sort through extraordinary amounts of bias, but that was simply not the case. It's unfortunate that Massad has gotten a bad rep from a handful of students who don't like that he has an opinion different than theirs and can back it up with FACTS. I was constantly blown away by the way he could always, ALWAYS respond to an antagonistic question with facts. Yes, of course, he has his own opinions. I didn't always agree with him, but I always respected that he cared enough about the subject and was so knowledgeable. Massad cares deeply about what he's teaching, and you end up caring too. I can't say that for most of the classes I've taken at Columbia.
Beyond his amazing lecturing abilities, Joseph Massad is incredibly nice. Everyone talks about his ego, but I was shocked when he stopped to talk to me in West Side early in the semester.

Look, there's only one thing you need to know about this course before opting to take something else. It is irrelevant whether or not you hope to find the material interesting, whether you think (and I can't imagine why anyone would, but judging from previous reviewers....) that Pablo is hopelessly adorable, or whether you are just shopping for a Major Cultures req that fits your schedule (big mistake....BIG mistake). 
The fact is - THERE IS NO WAY TO ACCESS THE COURSE MATERIAL aside from going to class. I'll just let that sit with you for a moment.
Okay, so the solution to the problem isn't as easy as it seems. You're probably thinking - ""That's not such a big deal. I'll just go to class, no problem."" No. You can go to class all you like, the likelihood that you will not understand a WORD Piccato says is far greater than the likelihood that you will make it to every lecture. I attended every class and I can't even recall for you a single thing we discussed. I'm not sure if things have changed since I took this course in Spring 2002, but as far as I'm aware, Piccato doesn't even go as far as to make availabe to students an outline or anything resembling an outline. Nothing with names or spellings of Spanish or Portuguese words. You can amuse yourself by guessing as to what these may be, as you will surely need to find things to do to amuse yourself to keep from passing out from utter boredom. I chose to focus in great detail on my penmanship, as Piccato will zip so quickly through facts that, were I to understand him, or have a clue what he was talking about, I could never keep up with him for the purposes of notetaking. 
This is particularly difficult because, as I said - THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO ACCESS THE COURSE MATERIAL - comprende? No text, no lecture notes, no outlines, no required reading that is even tangentially related to the course material. You are left without the option of referring back to notes for clarity, (because you will never succeed in taking notes), nor can you refer to any relevant text-like resource. (If you happen to have a keen enough ear to understand the words that come out of Piccato's mouth, I hope you also have a POWERFUL memory because the only way to review concepts or study for the exam is to sit for a few hours and see if you can't remember everything ever said in class. Another technique, which I implemented, was to write down random words and use those as a guideline for the exercise in memory, the sole study option.) There are suggested readings from something like 13 books which, if you are looking for a new and innovative way of buring several hundred dollars in less time than in would take to actually set fire to your credit card, you might consider doing. Or you have the option of being the only person at the Butler reserves, poring over absurd amounts of ""suggested"" reading that will never resurface in class, on papers, or in an exam. 
You may sit through class wondering how you'll ever succeed in coming up with supporting information for your two papers, which are based on outside readings, if you have no idea what goes on in class. I am here to tell you not to worry. Not only are the readings irrelevant, they are downright strange. One of the books was about a slave revolution in Brazil, and that was alright, but the other was Kiss of the Spider Woman - which is heavy on the homoeroticism, but light on, uh, HISTORY.

This was an awesome class and definitely the one to take if you want an outstanding Music Hum experience.  Stuart makes the class interesting and fun at the same time.  As a musician himself, he has extensive knowledge of music theory and a genuine interest in the material.  But what really sets him apart (as another reviewer says) is that he relates music to larger philosophical questions and encourages you to think about music in a broader context.  There is also a great use of film clips to discuss certain pieces.  StuartÂ’s a smart guy and always helpful and available to answer questions.  His tests and assignments can be challenging but if youÂ’re willing to put in some effort this class is amazing.

Sherry Ortner comes from a long line of anthropological tradition at Columbia (schooled by Clifford Geertz, etc.). She tried to cram in all sorts of readings. This class had nothing to do really with ""ethnography"" in any central way at all. Most of the readings were attempts to understand the breadth of ethnographic subjects. A lot of reading, most of which you don't have to do. Some of the reading is extremely interesting, others rather dull and purposeless. 
Workload:
No final in this class. No midterm. Just three papers, of increasing weight. The papers are very vague, i.e. ""Write about two of the texts we read. How do they display the evolving subjects and/or methods of ethnographies"".  Grading depends on your TA, but you might have Ortner.

Although it's true that Professor Blumberg's class is easy, and that she is very lax about things like homework and re-taking tests, it's because she has a very unique outlook on what her class should be for students: she actually wants them to learn!  Professor Blumberg is very understanding of the fact that her students have heavy workloads, and that her class does not always take top priority, but that doesn't mean she doesn't expect them to work in her course as well.  She gives students every opportunity to succeed, making herself available to them outside of class and allowing students to make up quizzes and tests, and shows genuine concern for their stress levels and personal lives, if you choose to talk to her about it.  There is literally no excuse not to do well in this class.  Do the assigned work, even though it's not always checked; she often pulls quiz and test questions directly from the assignments.

Students laugh their way through his classes because he has the awesome ability to make just about anything both interesting and amusing.

He is also very understanding when you need an extension on an assignment.  I strongly recommend Vincent to ANYONE.

Prof. Lotringer clearly knows what he's talking about.  This is both a blessing and a curse: on the positive side, you can expect any possible question you have to be answered in great detail, and lots of background information (I never saw him once bring in notes--everything came off of the top of his head).  On the negative side, he expects his students to have a graduate-level understanding of tons of different books and different literary schools of criticism (he is particularly fond of post-modernism).  Thus, most of my class struggled to keep up with him as he started jumping from book to book towards the end of the semester.  Overall, I learned alot, but I wish he had made more of an effort to engage his students and to make sure we knew what was going on.

He really hates it when students disrupt his lectures.  He doesn't have patience with students who struggle on some concepts.  If anything, what I took from ODE was what I learned from the book, not what he taught.
Always disorganized, his idea of an example is so basic the book doesn't bother with it.  It makes homework all the more difficult since he chooses problems that include stuff we've never learned.

Strohm really is a very nice guy, and his class is a great way to handle the English major pre-1800 req.  There is not a great deal of work aside from reading, which on most occassions could take less than an hour or so to get through.  He encouraged us to use interlinear translations online, which made the reading speed by and become intelligible.  Most importantly the class wasn't too intimidating, he's very sensitive to students' fear of Middle English and will hold your hand through the whole process.  He genuinely wants people to like the class and Chaucer, so he's very patient and encouraging.  Overall it was a good, not-too-intense introduction to Chaucer.

     Professor Dickey could not have done better with her section of CC.  She was exceptionally well prepared and knowledgeable about the texts.  Best of all, she is excellent at leading a complex discussion.  Not only did she keep it focused on the readings but she also made sure that all of the major points were covered.  Even if I did not understand the reading the first time around, I always left class with a good understanding of the work.  For this reason, this section is particularly good for anyone who cares about CC.  In addition to excellent discussion she is prepared to lecture if nobody has anything constructive to say (like around midterm season when few have the reading done).  She also knows how to use the blackboard-a rare and undervalued skill among college professors.  She related all of the readings beck to current events which not only facilitates an understanding of the works but also makes them relevant.  In my opinion, CC cannot possibly make one an expert on western philosophy but can give one tools for thinking about other issues--Dickey certainly understands this approach to the class.  In short, I have never learned so much in a single semester; I highly recommend this class.
Workload:
Lots.  Her readings are long and the short (one paragraph) essay due each week means that readings must be done well.  The essays do guarantee that at least some of the class will be prepared so that discussions can be worthwhile.  3 papers: her paper topics range from the silly (dialogues), to current events (how is Mill relevant to the issue of gay marriage), to the more traditional topics.  Proofreading is a must but she will read (and encourages)rough drafts (you get two weeks to write each paper).  Her midterm and final do require studying but are really fair (everything on them was discussed in class and probably even put on the board).

I disagree, to an extent, with the previous reviewer.  I am a soc. 
major who enjoys theory, but I found this class to be a refreshing break from the abstract and a glimpse into a fascinating field which is catching on with the general public- i.e. thefacebook.com, friendster.  Professor Watts has a great talent for taking very complicated material based in calculus and physics and making it accessible to social scientists like myself.  He was always available outside of class, and let us take our interests (which for many were more geared towards traditional sociology), and pursue them in our final project.  This class has affected how I think about my own friendship networks, about fashion trends, stock booms, and pretty much everything else...

Dweck is a great person, very nice, warm, and helpful. 
Unfortunately I took her class, partially based on her great reviews, and did NOT enjoy it. The tests are a pain in the ass because you literally have to memorize everything verbatim and spit it back exactly. Due her testing style is NOT at all stimulating, I found that although I went to every class and did all the readings...I learned NOTHING! The material is quite obvious, almost to the point of absurdity. Yes, spending time with you kid is probably good for their development. There are many nuanced theories, which while learning seemed mildly interesting, but looking back on the course, I cannot say that I learned one thing. If you are capable of memorization you will do wonderfully in the course...don't skip any classes because she wants you to regurgitate much of her lectures on the test.

 Having had him for a full year, I suggest you try your best to avoid this class.  Upside to it: yes, the work is minimal. You don't really have to participate, he doesn't care if you do, and you only read and write the normal amounts. However, his complete discomfort and nervousness in front of a class is painful to watch.  He turns red and is shaky whenever having to speak, and if there is a dominant student in the class, the two hours quickly turns into a runaway train that Sean cannot control. Also beware of having your own opinions in your paper....if he does not agree with you he will mark you down a letter grade without any other justification.

Professor Loh is a nice, quiet man who is unfortunately easy to fall asleep in front of.  His class was fairly straightforward and relatively easy to follow.  He teaches from slides which he also gives you a copy of, so it is not hard to follow along, and if you miss a class, it is easy to catch up on the notes, since you have most of them already.

Nice guy, weak class.   At least the first hour of the almost two hour class consists of him talking.  Not a good seminar experience, as you barely ever get to discuss anything.  He will interrupt your point to talk for 20 more minutes, and you won't be able to follow a word he says.  Class is hard to get through, readings are highly and unneccesarily technical.  You are never given readings that give a solid foundation for the big picture of globalization, and the scope of the material covered is very narrow for a course title that general.  A lot of the stuff you read is about labor, his specialty.   Honestly, I learned very little from this class.  He is never on campus and very inflexible with office hours, so good luck getting help with your paper if you happen to have a class when he holds them.

Typical class involved a student leading the discussion, having been coached by Carl beforehand, which means a lot of heavy silences when the discussion was not going Carl's, I mean. The Right. direction.

HOWEVER, I found her grading to be very arbitrary and unfair.  I worked very hard in her class, I did all the reading, actively participated in class, and wrote (what I considered) excellent essays, but felt as though I was always borderline no matter how hard I tried.  It seems like kids with philosophical backgrounds that could earn brownie points in discussions and essays by incorporating far fetched connections to some loosely connected philosophical works prospered in her class.

Jon Kahn, as some students referred to this professor, understands that more work does not always equal a better education.  While the course contains a fairly large amount of reading, Professor Kahn made sure to highlight the most important aspects through his detailed questioning of the works in class.  Professor Kahn demands the attention and energy of his students, and class participation seems to be a fairly large factor in the grading (ie: speak up in class, or you will be marked down).  While he did tend to grade the essays toughly, he was committed to improving our writing over the course of the year, and he made himself available for one-on-one discussion sessions.  He weights the later essays more heavily, and I did not feel as though the final semester grades were unfair.  Be prepared to spend a lot of time thinking about your essays, and actually proving your thesis.  Besides the work, Professor Kahn always made class enjoyable (and sometimes comical).  We had class outside and sometimes at local restaurants, in addition to taking a trip to the MET.   We also had a class discussion about whether or not to have a final, and we were able to negotiate our terms for the take-home final.

Remember Robin Williams and his ability to inspire his students in The Dead Poets Society? This CC section was no movie, and yet Professor P possesed the uncanny ability to truly touch those in his classroom. His erudition and sheer passion for knowledge is astounding, and Prof. P. is able to instill a sense of purpose into the souls (and I don't use that word loosely) of his pupils. The one criticism one may have is that close textual analysis suffers as a result of all the added selections and the style of Professor P. You may not walk away with a complete grasp of Kant (which sophomore really does?), but your exposure to great texts and important life lessons will serve you well in the future. This is the kind of classroom experience we all crave for in college, and only a few of us are lucky enough to experience.

Larkin's class was disorganized, as the other reviewers have said. 
lectures were a bit rambling, and he would forget what he was talking about when he tried to come back from tangents. But for all that it was one of my favorite classes the semester I took it. The readings were both broad and interesting, ranging from writers who founded various schools of thought in anthropology to contemporary writers who question the assumptions of the anthropological method.  Towards the latter part of the semester we began using the methods of anthropology to investigate contemporary issues and modern technologies, such as globalization  and amniocentesis. I also found that his tangents were actually some of the most interesting ideas I've heard. If you've already taken a bunch of anthro classes, maybe skip this class, but as an introduction to anthropology it's pretty good. As for the disorganization-quite frankly, the class is easy enough that organization is not actually required.

I found Professor Weinstock to be a wonderful instructor.  She facilitates enriching classroom discussions and allows students to direct the conversasions so that they can add in their own ideas. 
She is open to different interpretations of texts, and is very receptive of original thought.  The texts that she chooses is also a wonderful variety ranging from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to The Yellow Wallpaper and even Crime and Punishment.  She is a pretty fair grader, but can be nit-picky about specific things like not enough detail or needing more insight.  She is also a very nive woman and tends to always be in a good mood.

Under Prof. Borrell's instruction, the class was truly an eye-
opening experience. Professor Borrell is obviously passionate about the subject and has a good sense of humor, which helped the two hour seminar class fly by.

      Intro to international relations was probably one of the best classes that I have taken at Columbia.  This was due largely in part to the incomparable Brian Murray.  He is truly one of the best professors I have had at Columbia.  The subject matter is somewhat dull at times, however, the ""B -dawg"" understands this and tries to make it as interesting as possible.  Also, he is very approachable during and after class and is willing to give you advice and insight on the material.         Some reviews said that he went off on tangents which is true.  However, these tangents are an amusing break from the material and do not go on endlessly with no point.  He encourages class particpation but if you are one of those ""know-it-all/won't let anyone talk/think you're god's gift to international relations"" kind of people your participation grade will suffer.         As long as you do the reading and make an effort in class you will get a good grade and enjoy your first International relations experience.
P.S.  Anyone who says Brian Murray rewards slackers is crazy and just bitter because, unlike some of the cooler kids in the class, he did not think of bringing a six pack to the review session and mixing school with pleasure.

It's hard to give an accurate impression of Cathy if you haven't met her or sat in on one of her lectures. That said, if you take this class with her, expect a mixed bag. The readings were generally well-
chosen, and she and Professor von Hagen combined media like literature, photography, video, and art in an attempt to show students the flavor of each city. Having taken the class and having later visited Moscow and St. Petersburg, I can tell you that despite their efforts, no class can come close to the real thing. However as I walked through Ploshad Dekabristov and the Kremlin, I found myself reliving the stories I remembered from class. In short, it will give you a basic knowledge of Eurasian cities, and quite possibly a love for them, but will also show you just how much you have left to learn about them. Its angle is particularly valuable because it focuses not on the broad scheme of the Empire's history, but on its diverse and unique regions. I'd say if you love Eurasia, take this class with a caveat (see workload). As for Cathy, she is a disorganized and overworked, but wonderful person. She is very relaxed, and shows genuine concern for her students. She is usually late, though, so if you go to her office hours bring a book. 
It's too bad her spaciness often overshadows how great a scholar she is. Oh, and ""her"" city is Moscow, so she's a great resource about anything from the history of the city to where to eat once you're there. A gem of a professor if you can put up with the disorganization.

You don't have to do all the reading, but it was hard for me to figure out what to read and you've got to know your stuff at least moderately. Luckily there is room for creativity in the assignments.

Prof Moyn, or Sam for the more informal is a true intellectual and a teacher who helped me solidify my understanding and facility with argumentation in both my speaking and writing. Given that CC is a seminar-style class, most of the onus is on the students to discuss the pertinent issues at hand for the work at hand. This is not an easy task and Sam does not tolerate mediocrity when it comes to discussion. Sometimes he will interject ideas, but most likely he will ask your ""opinions"" on certain ideas. Truly a teacher who encourages creativity and new viewpoints, he almost always didn't completely agree with my opinions or views on the written assignments but still gave me great marks if I had written a coherent argument. He can be intimidating, writing terse emails without introduction or closing, and hardly ever smiles. However, after a few weeks, you'll begin to realize that if you put effort in, he's always willing to help [he's quite addicted to AIM and gives great help with reading and writing]. Overall, a superb professor, one who loves ideas surrounding culture, society, intellectualism, and history in general, one who will make you rethink the way you think about thought.

To avoid repeating any opinions hereinto expressed, let me just say that this man gives you a glimpse into how graduate-level mathematics should be done. Having done mathematics research over the past summer, I was amazed at how close Gallagher's method of definition, theorem, proof is to research caliber mathematics. While the protocol that he uses can be construed as boring [xeroxing notes and requiring no homework essentially], one should allow time to digest the notes that he does give. 
Bombard him with questions, he will give you great answers. While this class might be a shock to some who have been used to the calculus sequences, it is definitely a great class to test one's aptitude and curiousity for higher mathematics.

Essentially no written work. He assigns hw problems randomly and infrequently.

An execellent lecturer and a man who truly understands the field of algebra. It wasn't until the end of each semester that I understood how solid Neumann's lecturing style was. The true test that he passed is that he presents the material in an order and in a fashion so that the proofs of theorems and propositions are almost blindingly obvious. The notes that you will get from this class will be amazing. The course text, Fraleigh, that we used was utterly horrible; however, if you would like to learn from a better text, choose Algebra by Artin. I wouldn't spend too much time with a text, but rather with his notes. Another plus, Neumann is British and he has a pretty cool accent and speaks immpecable English. Finally, unlike most math professors, he is rather personable and approachable, but does tend to space out during conversation from time to time.

His seminar explored how history is written cross-culturally and had a remarkable book list. We explored Said's Orientalism, various historians/anthropologists who engage in the power/knowledge discourse and the perceptions of 'others' throughout history. Most of the course was student presentations, which fluctuated between well prepared and enlightening conversations as well as some disappointing let downs, a result of poor student preperation. Khalidi's perspective is remarkable, and his academic integrity is first class. Not one divisive issue was polemicized, and all topics were subject to rigorous academic debate. Regardless of his outside engagements and responsibilities, Khalidi made himself available at office hours and was extremely helpful and friendly on an array of issues.

This was a fairly good course.  First, about Bartelmus.  He has worked his whole life for economic institutes and various world organizations (such as the UN) working on the economics of sustainable development, and so he brings an incredible knowledge of the subject - both from the viewpoint of detailing the history of the progression of sustainable devt theories, and also from his own experiences of successful ideas.
Sustainable Development: Most economics majors probably are unfamiliar with this subject, so a one sentence summary: it deals with economic, social, and political practices that affect resource depletion and other inputs to the economy, and how our current economic practices affect a future generation's ability to sustain our quality of life.  If you aren't familiar with it, that's expected - half the course deals with the fact that standard economic theories do not account for these concerns, and it develops alternative micro and macro models that incorporate sustainable devt.
So, it was an interesting course, and mostly well presented by Bartelmus.  Negatively, the readings were scattered, but not horribly so.  
Of course, most of the ideas here won't help you when you're stealing money from people while working at Goldman Sachs, so take this course if you are interested in environmental economics, and have a fairly good background in micro.

For the first half of the course, I couldn't believe my luck. Dabashi is a brilliant, if eccentric, teacher whose extremely controversial opinions and lecture style really got me thinking. Unfortunately, about 7 weeks into the course, he starts to repeat himself--often, and without realizing it--and the class becomes very dull. Also, there are always a couple of overly vocal students in the class who feel it is their right to call out every inane thought that flits through their minds during lecture, which Dabashi ignores but can get extremely irritating to the other students. If you're a Comp Lit Major, enjoy the class while you can, then start skipping the extra required session at night.

I'm writing to combat the lukewarm reviews of Prof. Smith. I left his class with a great understanding of the impact race, gender and status has on our society. It was an eye-opening experience. As far as the course goes, yes, the first half is mainly theoretical, but it has to be, in order to lay the foundation for the second half: application of that theory via the life-story of the struggling individual. 
Prof Smith is down to earth and approachable. He understands the student mentality. He KNOWS you aren't gonna do most of the readings and he hones in on the major points in class. What's important to Prof. Smith is not the content of his syllabus, but the ideas that can be drawn from it -- ideas that speak volumes about the human condition.
One more thing: to those who say he has ""chicken-scratch for handwriting""-  that may be true, but he speaks articulately enough that you don't have to rely on his short-hand. Just pay attention and you'll be fine.

Professor Ferguson was my favorite professor from the Spring 2004 semester. Primarily a teacher at the law school, Ferguson rationalized his Monday / Wednesday mornings with the undergraduates as ""the happiest point in my day before I have to go yell at a bunch of idiots."" How could you not love this man? The class is almost entirely on Moby Dick, so non-Melville fans be forewarned. Professor Ferguson is enrapturing as a lecturer, with carefully chosen selections from the book that tie what is essentially a mass of relatively interrelated information into neat little mini-philosophical digressions. With this class as first on my schedule, I never had a problem getting up--even on Monday morning. He is constantly looking for input from the class, which once received is integrated seamlessly with his lectures--making him a gem among professors for that alone. The man is muy le excellent: Take the class, visit the office hours, and you will never look at Keats the same.

Ah. This class was truly a joy to have for my Major Cultures requirement. Professor Anderer's syllabus choices are excellent, with truly interesting individual selections in books and movies that also work together nicely for overarching themes in modern Japanese culture. When taking this class, note the tricksy necessary Thursday night movie viewing session that takes place roughly from 6:30-8:30 pm. While at first appearing to be a major drag, the movie nights were actually enjoyable and a really nice way to kick off my weekend--so swallow your pride, nothing worthwhile on Thursday is *really* going on at 8:30 anyways, you may as well be watching an interesting Japanese movie on a big screen for a class. Although Professor Anderer has a tendency to dwell on the inane--I recall entire class lectures that gently wander off into the  abyss of his consciousness, dwelling on one sentence or minor scene of a novel for ungodly amounts of time. Also, while welcoming class commentary, his lecturing style isn't really that receptive to incorporating new theories. The continuous lecture dives into inanity made it clear that Professor Anderer is simply waxing on books and movies that he genuinely finds fascinating--which makes for such an interesting class, it's worth taking that slightly trippy mental road into the recesses of his mind. The style could spell potential doom for less interesting professors, but with Professor Anderer, it's never a problem.
Workload:
Worth every drop of effort. 1 novel per class (usually fairly slim, always interesting).

Professor Strohm, built like a walking stick and twice as sprighty, is as entertaining and intelligent as the professors come at Columbia. While not exactly a Renaissance character in terms of his English interests, the man *knows* Chaucer. His fascination with Middle English, Chaucer, and the individual context of each Canterbury Tale during his smiley, boucy lectures is permanently infectious. Strohm is very receptive to student commentary during his lectures but also allows the silent, brooding students to keep their solitary confines in the back of the class undisturbed. If you have even the slightest interest in The Canterbury Tales, take this class with no one other than Professor Strohm. He is like Tigger in that not only is he bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy, and fun-fun-fun-fun-fun, but quite possibly the best thing about Strohm is that he is the only one. Irreplaceable.

Excellent teacher. I took this class over the summer, which meant that we had less time to cover the same material. Once or twice it felt like he was rushing through a topic to get to the next (more advanced) ones, but over all I found that his pacing was perfect. He's a funny guy (I thought, anyway), and sometimes tries to insert a bit of Philosophical Wisdom by telling us stories about his childhood. But he's a get-down-to-business-now kind of guy, and generally doesn't waste any time getting right into the day's lesson. In other words, He reviews the previous day's material only enough to refresh your memory, not to teach it over again. (If my tone is a bit ambiguous, I'm saying this is a good thing.)
Radu is very good about explaining concepts in a way that everyone could understand. If people look confused, he'll go through it again a bit slower, but I think his normal pace of teaching is a bit on the quicker side. (Personal note: I actually prefer this to the slow ""repeat and review redundantly until you drop"" style some professors like to use.) Any questions on the homework were cleared up after asking him to explain the problems on the board. 
He's actually a grad student, as the previous reviewer mentioned, but I highly recommend taking his classes.

I agree with the review above-- Pr. Mammen  is 100% rookie. The examples she gave in class had little or no correlation to the theory she was trying to explain.

Big Bird and Forest Gump had a lovechild.  His name is Bryan Scoular.  Even though you appreciate his friendly face on the first day of class, you'll soon recognize that this man is not cut out for teaching.  He cannot lead a discussion to save his life.  He lets people say the most idiodic things, but even worse, he lets the entire classroom sit silently.  He does not challenge or engage you, and one kid fell asleep in class every day and was never confronted.

Prof Dobie is a VERY sweet, kind, soft-spoken person. She's also the undergrade dept advisor and someone with EXTENSIVE background in F&F Studies, so she's a great person to get to know if you have a real interest in the subject. 
As a professsor, however, Dobie's class was pretty dry; she wasn't great at provoking conversation, and most of the class was a Q&A type session, where she asked a question and class time was spent trying to direct students to the exact answer she had in mind, rather than discuss topics/issues raised in the readings.

I didn't mind Lillians class. I think she came in with some set points that she wanted the class to get to and if things got off her intended track, she would try to redirect it even if the current debate was interesting. Sometimes this was a good thing given that some of these people who have written really negative review are typical Columbia egotistical types who wanted to blab about either Kant, Sartre, or post-modernism. Ugh. The Stranger is a good book, but it came up way too much in my section. As far as Lit Hum goes, I think the grass is always greener in some other section.

I enjoyed Mr. Lauritzen's Latin class immensely.  He has an encyclopedic (or encyclopaedic, more suggestive of the Greek root, enkyklios paideia) knowledge of the classical world, and he often gave interesting lectures and anecdotes about history, philology, and philosophy related to the language lesson of the day.  He's also very funny in a dry, above-it-all way, and his idiosyncracies and strange observations help to maintain interest during the more tedious sessions of memorization and translating aloud.  Rote memorization is of course integral to an elementary course, and he made clear (in class and on the quizzes and tests) just how important getting the paradigms down pat was to getting a good grip on the language.  He had two habits in his examinations: putting the same questions in consecutive quizzes, and placing material from earlier lessons on quizzes weeks later.  Frustrating, but helpful in establishing a base of Latin knowledge.  Mr. Lauritzen is a stickler for syntax, so be prepared to be dumbstruck at first by his changes in your English-to-Latin translations.  Eventually this focus will enable you to pick apart a Latin sentence by word order and word endings, a skill I've found invaluable while working on translations from Latin to English.  The Wheelock textbook has its strengths, but Mr. Laurtizen energetically points out its weaknesses and works around them with his own lessons, and later in the year, in-class paragraph translations of Cicero, Caesar, Catullus, and others.  I suppose my only complaint is that he sometimes spent too much time calling on students who clearly didn't know or care about the material.  Awkward silences abounded in such instances.  Of course, Mr. Lauritzen would simply start talking about how ""the Vatican still publishes new Latin words, and the word for cell phone is.."" or ""classicists are very bizarre people, like this fellow who is translating Harry Potter..."" and I would be thankful once again for such a strange funny, and informative class experience.  Also, the man is a Hellenist, not a Latinist, and still a great Latin teacher.  Just believe in what he's doing and be energetic about learning and improving.

This is not the typical Spanish class.  Consider yourself warned.  Two semesters are compressed into one Â– all frills (vocabulary lessons, games etc) have been removed.  Essentially this is Spanish at its most straightforward.  Little emphasis is put on vocabulary or Spanish culture.  Heavy emphasis is put on the grammatical concepts, speaking, and listening skills.  The pace of the class is very fast -- we covered about two chapters a week.  If you have no previous Spanish experience, this class may not be the best fit.  For those who have studied spanish (or latin), and want a fast-paced yet thorough review, this class is a good option -- especially because it only meets 3 days a week (and fridays aren't one of them).
You will be teaching the grammatical concepts to yourself outside of class.  Class-time is for practicing those concepts.  Much of the work in done in pairs and Raquel is simply there to correct you.  Don't expect Raquel to teach you the fine points of Spanish grammar -- while she will do her best to clarify things if asked, all of the learning will come from reading the book (it's a fairly good book, although the content can be scattered around).
DonÂ’t be scared away in the first week.  Raquel can seem very intimidating and her teaching style comes across as very narrow minded: ""don't ask me how to say a word in Spanish, just choose a different word.""  This is simply to shrink the class down, and weed out the people who wonÂ’t be able to keep up.  Our class had only 9 or 10 people, and it was wonderful.  If you have a choice, take the later section.  Because it's after the working day ends, you'll get to meet some ridiculously interesting people.
Raquel is fun, but slightly eccentric (she has many interesting conspiracy theories).  SheÂ’s not one of the best teachers i've had here at Columbia, but it really doesnÂ’t matter for this teach-yourself class.

i think meredith is an intelligent, well organized and enthusiastic teacher. i found her a bit intimidating but she warmed up by the end of the class. she obviously loves the material she covers. she's well spoken and the selected readings and lectures were always worth my time and very informative. i'd definitely suggest taking this class if offered again.

This is an amazing class that is taught by an amazing professor.  Like another reviewer said, Professor Scolieri is incredibly loveable and inspiring.  I took this class on a whim my fall semester of freshman year, and I am so glad that I did.  It opened my eyes to the importance of dance in this world and of dance as history but also as a means of maintaining and shaping history.  I was more intrigued by the second half of the semester, during which we learned about dance forms such as butoh and the hula.  If you thought the hula was just about women dancing around in grass skirts, you are mistaken, just like I was before I learned about it.  It's about so much more; dance as a whole is about so much more than just entertainment.  However, this is not to say that I did not enjoy the first half of the semester.  I looked forward to going to class, and even though there's a lot of information to take in during the lectures, Professor Scolieri is incredibly organized and holds your attention with his enthusiasm, energy, and humor.  There were also a few workshops taught by guests, which were all very enjoyable and allowed you to experience a dance first-hand.
In short, I absolutely loved the class and Professor Scolieri.
Workload:
For each class, expect to screen a video or two (which could be anywhere from 30 minutes to more than an hour or almost two hours) and/or read from the course packets for each class.  However, the readings and video screenings can be pretty interesting.
There is one midterm, which is of fair caliber and requires you to identify certain terms, analyze a clip of a dance, and write an essay on one of the major themes of the course.  The final is much the same, although longer, of course.  The tests will probably take you the whole of the time that is allotted, not because they are incredibly difficult but because there will be a lot that you need to write and consider.
There are also essays.  You will have a choice of writing either (a) two 5-6 page papers or (Ib) one 5-6 page paper and two 750 word papers on two dance performances that you choose to attend in NYC.  One of the 5-6 page papers requires that you visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the other requires that you screen three videos.  Professor Scolieri grades your paper thoroughly and fairly, leaving comments and questions to trigger thought.
Take this class & hopefully youÂ’ll love it as much as I did.

Amazing professor & amazing class!  I loved this class.  Professor Suarez made me feel so comfortable speaking in class, and I really appreciated this because I had always been hesitant to speak in other classes.  The class involves discussion about topics that the class picks in the beginning of the semester.  As Prof. Suarez goes through each class, he assigns articles to read and gives us questions to think about.  Prof. Suarez makes the class as enjoyable as possible.  One of our assignments was to watch Pedro Almodovar movies.  We did group work as well, and we also had to participate in a cultural event in the city, which was very fun.
Prof. Suarez makes the class feel very laid back and casual, but at the same time, he provokes thought and allows you to improve your speaking and writing skills.  I cannot say enough good things about this class and professor.  Prof. Suarez is so nice, friendly, and approachable.  He is more than willing to answer any and all questions, and he is very knowledgeable about Latino culture and language.
Workload:
Workload is fair and interesting.
Homework consists of reading the articles, commenting on the online discussion forum, and sometimes listening to online audio.
There were three writing assignments that were about 750 words each.  Prof. Suarez graded them fairly and allowed you to revise them, which was great.
There were two quizzes on grammar, which you should not have a problem with if you read the textbook, do the assigned textbook exercises, and pay attention in class when Prof. Suarez goes over the textbook material.  The textbook assignments are definitely manageable (usually around 10 pages + the exercises).  
The final consisted of a group presentation and an oral exam.  This might sound kind of intimidating at first, but it isn't at all.  The oral exam, or ""interview"" as he called it, was very casual, so it feels like you're participating in a regular class discussion.  The final group project was also a lot of fun.  You get to pick your own topic and then use whatever form of presentation you wanted.
This class is wonderful, so if you're trying to decide on a Spanish class to take, this is it!

Carmen is . . . interesting.  She's definitely very enthusiastic about poetry, and so we spent most of the class time reading and discussing poetry (well, actually she mostly talked, but if you were persistent you could get a word in edgewise).  A lot of her passion definitely comes through and she has a lot of interesting things to say.  However, don't think this will be an easy class; in general, you won't have to do much of anything, but there are two huge papers you have to write that are worth most of your grade (and they're due right when you have lots of tests to take for more work-
intensive classes).  They don't have a specific topic (something like ""discuss a poem and the life of the poet who wrote it"") or page limit, but the expectation seems to be that they will be long and well-
written.
It's hard to say anything in general about this class.  If you go to class and write decent papers, you'll get a decent grade.  If you like listening to a knowledgeable person talk for several hours a week, you might enjoy it.  But if you want an engaging class you can participate actively in, I would suggest finding a better option.
Workload:
Fairly easy on the whole: mostly reading poetry in class and occasionally on your own.  One final oral presentation.  Two exceedingly long (10-20 pages) and ambiguous papers worth almost all of your grade as midterm and final assignments.

I'm disturbed by the fact that students at this university would blame their lack of participation in a class on a teacher.  Obviously, as a previous reviewer pointed out, you will not get a good grade if you sleep through the class.  Then, the class will be a joke, but the joke will be on you.
That being said, you can get a lot out of Asifa's class.  She is a sweet and understanding woman, and she really does know how to write and teach.  In exchange for sharing this with you, she expects that you will participate and be respectful, but that's not out of the ordinary. If you pay attention and work hard, you will emerge a better writer, and you will probably get an A.

I took this class hoping to get a good overview of Asian American Literature, and wow was I completely disappointed. I only stayed in the class because it fulfilled 2 major requirements for me and was absolutely no work. I think I went to half the classes and read 10% of what was assigned and walked away with an A. Professor Gamalinda is a poet (not teacher) by profession and seems to avoid saying anything educational or substantial. He breaks the class into small groups and basically lets go of the reigns, resulting in the most disorganized discussion you'll ever experience. The only two books you read in class are The English Patient and America is in the Heart (which, by the way, we got complete weeks of NO CLASS to ""finish reading the book"")....everything else comes in his coursepack, a flimsy group of pages of random poems and short stories that are of course interesting, but not particularly challenging. We spent entire classes discussing two or three poems with no focus, which basically led to beating a dead horse. If you really want to learn about Asian American Literature, wait until another professor teaches this class. Otherwise, it's a great slacker class.

you get 2 weeks each to finish reading the 2 books he assigns. other than that, there's a couple poems or short stories for class that take 15 min to read. i think there were two papers to write during the semester on essay topics that were so wide and general you'll have no desire to answer them.

Prof. Kashper is a wonderful, saintly woman.  I missed four weeks of the semester when I was taking her class, and she was flexible, helpful, and understanding.  She encourages class discussions, she respects student's oppinions, and she rarely ever feeds literary criticism.  As she said near the end of the course, we usually come to the same conclusions as the famous critics if we discuss it enough ourselves, and she allowed us to do so.  She grades incredibly fairly, and allows re-writes.  She's very flexible about due dates if you really have a conflict-- but she doesn't take any BS.  She chooses interesting novels and loves it when you discover Russian Literature for the first time through her class.  She also takes you out to lunch or dinner a lot, and her class included a trip to the Metropolitan Museum and the Metropolitan Opera when I took it.

I loved Zee. I am a chemistry major and thought I would never have an interest in art, but after her class I decided to become an Art History minor because I was so confident and excited by her class. She is definitely demanding, but that is only because everyone expects Art Hum to be simple... It is definitely possible to well in her class - you just need to do the work & do it well. If you are considering a major/minor/anything in Art History but have no background in the subject or even if you do, Zee is definitely your woman. She will prepare you to have opinions about art & feel confident to discuss anything (even modern art if you thought you'd never have a clue).

he tried to adapt teaching methods to target everyone's weaknesses and make sure everyone was as close to the same level as possible, but he wasn't always successful. the workload is very intense and the class is very fast-paced so it's mostly up to you to make sure you're learning everything you should be, especially because he doesn't like to meet very often during office hours.

Before I start my review of Seidel, let me just say that I loved Joyce before this class and having (re)read more of his work, I love him even more. But I wouldn't accredit this to the brilliance of Seidel.  I appreciate that he is definetly passionate about the work and once you approach him privately, he is very eager to help. However, my main complaint is that I think he forgets that most of the students have not already read Ulysses several times. Like other reviewers, I feel he gets too caught up in minutae rather than investigating Joyce's larger themes and metaphors. Also, it is encredibly irratating the way he skips forwards with information, letting you know to pay attention to page 8 because on page 91 this same character says the same words in a different way (he then has the class flip to page 91 even tho the reading has been only up to page 30). Part of the challenge and the fun is finding it for yourself and I think Seidel has forgotten this.

STAY AWAY!!! Extremely difficult course, even for a senior majoring in math - the material is not explained properly. As this class is 95% filled with students in the math of finance grad school program, expect the material to be EXTREMELY difficult. You will receive homework problem sets that are designed for people with several years research exposure in finance. And NONE of it is explained in class. The lectures jump randomly from topic to topic, and most of it is not worth listening to because in won't help you on the midterm/final. As a math major, I got a B- in this class after working my butt off and spending almost no time on other classes that really mattered. And grading is also extremely random - I know people who deserved at least an A- but ended up in the C range (and vice versa)

I admit that Johan's tests were difficult, however, his eccentric style and comments made classes more than entertaining!

His paper topics were by no means standard; they were innovative, which made the writing experience much more valuable as a student, even for those of us who lacked an extensive musical background.  Johan's focus on sociological issues allowed us to explore music in a more relevant context.  Perhaps the best quality of Johan as an instructor was his availability outside of class.

More often than not she is more knowledgeable than the lecture professors, but most importantly she can explain things without condescending.
By all means, take Advanced Orgo Lab if you're interested in the subject.  The class itself is taught with less structure than Orgo lab, which thankfully means more individual initiative along with more interesting/challenging lab work.  It is by no means disorganized though, for Tauqir's been at this for quite a bit.
Workload:
A few longer labs that generally run over the time allotted, but what is due and when is flexible because this class isn't about premed grade-grubbing so much as it is about developing your own lab skills and interests.  One final synthesis/investigation that is quite difficult, but plenty of help is provided.

Suhit is a great guy who is always willing to help and has creative ideas for making a boring course a lot more interesting, esp. with developing a challenging but useful project to work on throughout the course. Unfortunitly for me it was a little to tough at times. But he really puts forth his absolute best effort to every student and is an upstanding guy. I don't know if I would suggest taking a 4 credit class at all over the summer, but if you have to you would be lucky to do it with him. I actually enjoyed the course a lot more then i expected. He is a phd student, but i hope he gets a chance to teach a real semester course where he doesn't have to cram all his ideas into a short time frame.

Very interesting class.  Prof. Mercer is clear, concise, and provocative in her explanations and questions.  She stays on topic and her examples provide areas for research or fun reading.  I highly recommend anyone, philosophy major or not, to take this class.
On the other hand, the Prof. Mercer has a lot of students come during her office hours so it is difficult to have discussions with her on class texts.  Though she doesn't shoo you out the door, she does give brief explanations before you feel the peeping heads of other students looking through the crack.
I think she's a fair grader.  The majority of the class got B's.  She looks for a clear, well developed and argued point.  You can't crap your way through her papers, short as they are.  Also, she'll warn you not to choose topics outside her recommended list unless you confirm with her first.  Please take that advice if you're in the class.  
Prof. Mercer does come off a little prim and proper and she does argue her point if she doesn't agree with you, but I think that's a good thing.  She articulates her reasons for her argument and you can critique her response if you like.  Some students did seem to get on her ""bad side"" but I think it's only because they either didn't do the reading or gave a long speech with little evidence from the text.  Yet even those students get a nod for good dissenting arguments.
In the end, Prof. Mercer is not my favorite person in the world, but she is a wonderful teacher who lets you know her expectations and provides you with interesting and intellectual materials.

No surprises here. It's your average political philosophy class complete with Plato, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Machiavelli, Marx, and Nietzsche. But beware, Nick is anything but interesting. His lectures highlight the obvious and there is little (if any) discussion in his class. He spends 65 minutes providing a synopsis of the assigned reading, and leaves 10 minutes at the end for questions. He does not display even an ounce of origial thought and isn't really looking for yours either. He is a walking, talking collection of cliff notes- so if you do the reading, you never have to go to class. But if you don't do the reading, which you may not because there is so much, lecture will keep you up to speed. His grading guidelines are very vague and he lectures as if it were his first time (nervous stuttering, awkward pauses, and such). I'm sure there are better poly sci professors out there.

Jonathan makes a great first impression on the class -- he's SO full of energy, connects well with young people, and is a Columbia graduate himself.  He has taught this course before, and takes total control, dropping some works, and adding others.  He (re-)reads the books along with the class, each time he teaches.  He makes it easy to care about lit-hum, often drawing lessons from the books and applying them to real life.  He frequently discusses personal matters: his wife, his young children, his parents, and he how the themes of literature surface within his life (i.e. jealousy between his kids, telling the truth to his wife etc.).  He makes lit-hum a very human subject (in fact, it bordered on a psychology course).
I do have a few complaints about Jonathan as a professor -- there is a predetermined 'correct' answer to every question he asks, and he'll waste no time shooting you down if you're incorrect.  Because of this, he can be intimidating, especially to the more shy members of the class.  He plays favorites too.  He also can get ridiculously off-topic (often talking about music or old movies).

I cant stress enough, how benificial it is to do the extra credit assignment.  I made a pathetic grade of a 38% on my midterm, and still managed to make a B+ in the class.  In regards to the midterm, make sure to ask the TA's what information they are looking for on the tests, cite the experiments.  Before the midterm the TA's claimed they were looking for ""overall concepts"" which is crap because the tests often ask for very specific details from the readings and the lectures.  Memorize the charts, there will undoubtedly be one on the test, and you can stop reading the Pinker book after the midterm.  Despite Krauss's claims, the PInker book will not have you laughing outloud on the subway.

Troels is a jovial, English-speaking, cheery man. He loves math and is very low key about his classes. If you have taken calc before and didn't do that well, this is your best option for a math at Columbia. Most teachers tend not to speak any English and assign numerous web works problem sets. Troels only gives 2-3 problems a night and if you ask him not to give you homework, he will agree; But youll want to do the homework as that is what his tests are based on. He doesnt really have a teaching plan or grading plan, so make sure he knows who you are and likes you. The tests are basically very fair, but he usually throws one problem at you that you will not be able to do. don't fear because he always says if you got 100 you shouldnt be in the class. he expects people to make mistakes, especially in calc 1. the final exam is extremely fair and basically based on the other tests and the problems he does in class (which usually come straight from the book).

Our class with Prof. Yarnal had probably the best dynamic of any class I've taken at Columbia.  It was basically 20 exceptionally bright - brilliant people with a lot of interesting things to say about a lot of interesting topics.  
Discussion at times was fragmented because everyone had something to say (a good thing in this class) but it was difficult to stay on one topic for long because it -- we'd go off on interesting and relevant, but somewhat off course tangents
Prof. Yarnal knew his stuff cold -- He helped illuminate the material and was very willing to take it all to the edge.  Intellectually exciting (although he does speak in a monotone).  He's  a Buddhism expert, which I found to be very helpful b/c it appears that a lot of questions of theory/method are discussed in fruitful ways in the Buddhist discourse.

One of my favorite classes at Columbia.  He was engaging, well spoken, and helped us learn about and enjoy an amazing collection of works.  Although some previous reviewers have shelled him for being condescending in class, I found his conduct to be quite the opposite.  For example, there was one student in my class who was consistently (even agressively) wrong, and yet had a penchant for hearing his own voice.  Instead of hanging him out to dry, Mr. Onafuwa corrected this student and others as gently as he could.  Whereas I might have snapped at this guy, Yemi was always patient.  Another aspect of his teaching for which he has been wrongly harangued is a heavy workload and unnecessary amount of reading.  Though the reading is suggested, one was never evaluated on having done it.  Class discussion was based on the slides in front of us, the professor's presentation, and any additional outside input from students (usually not from the reading).  Also, seeing as the only other grades in class were a participation, midterm, and final,  there was no way I can possibly find a way to complain about the workload.  If you come in ready to learn and to participate, having spent at least a little time with the works before class, this will be a great class for you.
My class seems to have had a much more enjoyable time with Mr. Onafuwa than some of the previous ones.  All other things being equal, I feel like he has gone from a knowledgeable but unaproachable professor to one of the best instructors you could hope to land in this course.

Overall, the class was dull and uninspired thanks to Hamilton's monotonous focus in lectures and his general disinterest.  I'll reiterate what others have said: the only things I gleaned from a semester's worth of Ross Hamilton's meandering lectures were a litany of catch phrases -- substance, architectonics, etc.  And he's also just as distracted and flaky with his students as everybody's said.  He's genial and flexible, sure, but terribly unengaged and unengaging.  He habitually showed up to class ten to twenty minutes late, and while the class (comprised mostly of grad students and some seniors) waited for him to show, it eventually devolved into discussions of what an uninspiring professor he was.  (""This is FAR from the best class I'm taking this semester"" was one girl's comment, and I had to agree with her understatement.)  Because even when Hamilton WAS in class, his lectures weren't even lectures so much as repetitive term papers stuffed with long quotations from the readings; indeed, for nearly two hours he'd stand in front of the class reading aloud straight from a large stapled document.  If there were any time afterward (and there often wasn't), he'd pose a few vague questions to the class for discussion that usually met with tepid response.  Also, one on one, Hamilton acted equally uninterested.  The one time I visited his office hours, he barely responded to my questions or comments; instead he looked at me blankly, suggested I think about the texts on my own, and asked whether I had some more specific questions.

This guy is the reason that tenure should not exist.  He needs to be retired by the school as he gives questions on exams that were not covered in any readings, homeworks, or classes.  He is inappropriate in conversations outside of class, will not help you even if you beg, and grades unfairly on a C minus curve.  He forgets what he is talking about in mid sentence often which is probably why he puts things not covered on the exams.

He is one of the most prepared lecturers you'll ever meet at Columbia.  In an hour of half of lecture, he hardly wastes any words.  He chooses them carefully and conveys his ideas precisely.   You'll appreciate this ability of his when you read impossible texts like Hegel's Philosophy of Right.  They start to make sense.
What's also good about this class is that Neuhouser not only delves into the texts from Smith, Hegel, and Marx, but also contextualizes the main themes to the contemporary times.   His lectures are engaging but so too are the ensuing discussions.  
By no means, this is an easy class.  If you're thinking about winging a class, don't take this one.   But as the previous reviewers said, this class can really be tremendously rewarding if you're prepared to put some serious effort; you'll come out of this class heck of a lot smarter than before (really.)
About his papers: start early, as you can't put subjective BS and expect to get away with it.   Consulting with the guy beforehand helps a lot. 
About his finals: there are no real surprises.   It consists of passage identification, a few short essays, and one long essay.  If you've been attending his class regularly, you really can't do badly. (btw: try not to miss a class, because you miss one, say on Hegel, you'll be completely lost afterwards.)

She's OK. Although she's boring, vision-impaired, and monotonous, you will succeed through the boring reiterations of text-book material when you keep in mind that this is just an introductory-based class. Thus, for the purposes of objectively introducing psychology as a discipline, the objective (not the intepretive) knowledge shall be respected and given in kind. Many of us forget that ""boring"" material, or material that's presented in a boring manner, does not mean anything about the ""value"". In that sense, this class will prepare you very well for upcoming psychology classes. She's great at getting into heads the fundamental material required for psychology. Just remember that you only develop somewhat of an appreciation... after the fact... and only if you're strong enough to pursue psychology after an entire semester of yawns, rolly-eyes, and the kind of yawns that make you  drool due to an extremely yawnful teacher that makes you yawn for an entire semester.

But, I will be forever grateful that I took this class because a) I got over my fear of public speaking (ie making a fool of myself) because participation is 20% and b) it really opened my mind and challenged me to think constantly during the class. He comes off as opinionated, but I think that's just because he knows he's right :).  He really took the discussion to places I have never before nor since travelled to in any other class here.  Always challenging us NOT to assume things, not to be lazy in thinking liberal ideology is always right, to read critically - to have our ""bullshit detector"" always on.

I'm typing this at 3 a.m. in the morning (I have school at 9a.m. tomorrow) and that speaks volumes about the regard I hold for this man.  
His teaching style is very flexible yet disciplined. What I mean by this is that he goes over several overarching topics in general and lets the students ""fill him in"" on the details. He never lets details bog his teaching down, and always let the main arguments drive home the points to the students.
His greatest strength is that he lets students see the big picture very easily, and draws parallels between scenes in the text well. Also, he seldom (in fact, never) puts a student down because of a opinion voiced which may not have any relevance to the topic at hand. In fact, what he tries to do is take the point and draw a certain linkage to the discussion, and often tosses a word of praise at the student. To me, that's important -- knowing that my instructor appreciates my opinions, no matter how dumb they are, and in so doing raises the overall energy level of the class.

Above all things, you'll learn how to really analyze literature and thus glimpse how beautifully the texts are structured in conveying their themes, criticisms, and other ideas that aren't always obvious without a close look. I wouldn't say he's a hard grader, exactly-- he holds papers up to very high standards, but if you get the hang of them, you'll benefit enormously in writing focused papers in just about any course that examines literature (CC, UW, etc.). Given this, you're allowed to write as many papers as you want (he emails paper topics before each reading), grades the midterm and final much more lieniently than the papers, and reflects how much effort you put into the course at the end.
Overall I highly recommend him as an instructor. He's great to correspond with via email or office hours, is an extremely kind individual, and while class discussions are generally very focused, he promotes a friendly and light-hearted environment if you're willing to participate (though he doesn't mind lecturing if it's 9 AM and everyone is still asleep).

Beware my friends, she is a deceiving woman. This class was outrageous! She appears to be a nice, calm, and a sweet woman, but her teaching is as bad as it gets. From the start I knew that this class was a disaster. If you see her face during class (and not her back) then you are one of the lucky ones. She teaches with her lecture notes to her face and her back to the class. If asking a question, dont expect an answer too soon. She will begin by looking to the ceiling in anticipation for an answer, after a couple of moments and copious ""umms"", she will indulge you with absolute nonsense. Trust me, dont ask questions! If you take this class, then all of your future upper levels are destined for failure. If you are going to be an econ major, you need a solid foundation in micro, not a bunch of crap!

Professor Gerhart is a great teacher.  She comes off a little stern, but she knows more about the political history of South Africa than anyone I have met.  The class is challenging but not too hard.  She definately has set answers in mind and her own way of doing things (She wont accept papers if you come to class late).  You get to read some really interesting primary source material and Nelson Mandela's autobiography.  She invites the class to her apartment on Friday nights to watch African docuementaries and to eat food.  She is always available if you need her.  This was the best history class I took at Columbia.

From the first lecture, I knew this class would be the bane of my existence at Columbia and that one thing was certain, I would end up cursing the day Professor Chasin was awarded tenure. I agree with all the previous reviews, Professor Chasin is not your friend, nor is his a competent lecturer or a nice person.  In fact, my hatred for this class and this man runs so deep, that I am writing this review after only 8 lectures and before the exam, which I am sure will be just as retarded as Chasin's lectures and lame jokes. 
My first problem with this class was the organization, which is nonexistent. 
Professor Chasin always arrived early to lecture but somehow we pretty much always started 10 or 15 minutes late due to various ""computer malfunctions."" Either his computer would crash mid - lecture or his PowerPoint slides would magically disappear and we would waste class time while he scratched his head, patted his tummy and tried to figure out how to get the presentations working again. He's
been teaching this class for how many years and he still can't work out the kinks in his presentation?! That's just unacceptable, if these professors expect me to bust my ass in their class and to devote myself to biology (a subject I now detest), then I expect more from them. I don't want to see PowerPoint slides or badly printed handouts that look like they are from the year of the flood. Is this what $10,000 in tuition at Columbia gets you, crappy looking PowerPoint slides and lecture notes that make no sense? 
My second major problem with this class is Chasin himself, as he just doesn't give a shit about his students. This fact becomes very evident second week into the semester after Chasin finally wraps up talking about water and gets into the ""real"" biology. I understand that this is Columbia, but when I sign up for a class called ""Introductory Biology,"" I expected to be taught biology ground up, say we'd go over some basic concepts for the dumbasses like myself who took AP Chemistry over AP Biology in high school and then build from there and go over more complex concepts. Well if you're expecting that from Chasin, you're shit out of luck because he skips all the ""real"" biology in favor of longwinded tangents about biochemistry and nonsensical explanations of biological phenomena. For example, expect lecture to go a little something like this: ""Well if we put this and this together, yada yada yada, and then we get a peptide bond."" Will you learn what a peptide bond is? Absolutely not, but at least you will learn that Chasin suffers from kidney stones, how enlightening! More than anything, this class and Chasin are just frustrating because from day one, you're pretty much screwed because lecture goes no where and you will be forced to pour over his lecture notes posted on the course website (which conveniently leave out crucial points I might add so you're pretty much forced to attend lecture), while frantically reading and outlining the two textbooks required for the class, while trying desperately to get all the problem sets done. 
Finally, my last problem with intro to biology is that it's unfair that both Chasin and Mowshowitz have a monopoly over biology at Columbia. If we are given the opportunity to choose between THREE orgo, FOUR G. Chem and THREE Physics professors, why are we only offered one choice for biology?! And furthermore, I know plenty of people are unhappy in biology right now (at least 10 people storm out of the lecture every class) and there have been many complaints about both professors in years past as they both are terrible professors, their tests are unfair and the class is not taught properly. I'd like to know why they are still allowed to teach this class, better yet, I'd like to know how Chasin even defended his dissertation when he says things like ""well I really can't explain this to you."" 
Unfortunately, if you're a premed or a postbacc you have to take this class, but be warned, it's a frustrating, stressful and crappy experience that will leave you feeling overworked, jaded and wishing that Professor Chasin would transfer to another university.

There are two types of successful Columbia economics students: the first usually understands the material immediately, applies it regularly in everyday life and problem-solving outside their coursework, typically does not need to study extensively for exams, and truly enjoys the classes in their major. The second does not easily extend one concept into new areas, gets to know the TAs and recitation times very well, may not see a connection between economics and real life, and has to study for many hours in order to manage exams.
If you are of the first type (as I would consider myself), Susan Elmes' lectures will be the highlight of your day--and your week. If you are of the second type, this course will make you want to cry. And if you're somewhere in between, then so be it for your reaction.
No one will contest that Elmes is quite possibly Columbia's most talented lecturer. Her presentations of the material are more carefully scripted than a political stump speech, and better-executed at that. She never misses a beat and never, ever loses her place or gets confused. She understands this material better than any of her students know arithmetic. And if you hate that person who likes to ask stupid questions, argue with professors, or question their conclusions, then you'll be amazed when Elmes, without even taking a moment to re-think her argument, will *take* *them* *down*.
But for the second-type people, it's important to know that her explanations are sufficient and thorough, but if you are not the type to thoroughly understand material immediately, you may get lost once she has moved on expecting that you're all set. Don't expect any help from the book; it is completely conceptual, a stark contrast to her highly quanitative lectures. The problem sets are often longer than other professors assign in similar classes, and will frequently ask you to use your brain a bit and extend the class discussion to think about new problems--again, not much of a problem for type 1s, but a source of major frustration (and recitation attendance) among type 2s. And the exams--they're tough. In my class, no more than 5% of the class even had time to completely finish the midterm.
If you're not sure if you're a type 1 or a type 2, then go for Elmes. I can't guarantee it'll be easy, but I can definitely guarantee you will not be bored in lecture, and you'll probably even learn a thing or two even despite your best intentions. You'll also forevermore go to other classes wishing that every Columbia lecturer met the gold Elmesian standard which you, as a naive freshman, had once thought would be the norm at an Ivy League institution.

I was in this class for about two-and-a-half weeks before I dropped down to 1403.  Professor Cole is a very thorough professor, and expects you to be able to learn a lot of fundamental concepts very quickly.  In the first week I had to pick up differential equations.  In the second it was complex exponentials.  And in the future it was going to be linear algebra and partial differential equations, and who knows what else.  If you have a solid math background and are interested in covering everything there is to know about describing and analyzing waves, then by all means, take this class.  But if you only want to take it because it looks better than 1403, you'll end up in 1403 anyways.

WORKLOAD INTENSE.  He's a PhD candidate over at the JTS, so he knows what he's talking about...in terms of the Bible.  Other than that, he readily admits that he isn't an expert on the readings but that doesn't mean he's unprepared.  He has some good insights and he makes sure that the discussion doesn't drift too far from the main topic.

EM is one of the best teachers I've ever had.  Few professors today inspire students to get up at 8, bust out the highlighter, and strain to hear every word spoken in lecture.

I, too, am not a dancer. I took this class simply to satisfy a requirement, hoping that it would be an interesting survey course, like Art History. It is true that Professor Garafola is very well-versed and highly knowledgable about her field. She certainly seems nice enough in class, but she takes herself way too seriously, as if she is the end-all and be-all and if you really don't think that Dance History is the MOST important thing in the world, boy do you have your priorities screwed up! 
During her office hours, she was also highly unprofessional by taking out her own issues on a student. She suddenly went off on a total tangent about the legitimacy of her profession and dance history in general. She is a ridiculously hard grader, nit-picking at EVERYTHING as if to really try to convince you that yes, it really is THAT important. 
She assigns a lot of reading, accompanied by mandatory viewings of specific performances which you can get in the media center. If you are a commuter, this is the absolute worst, since you can't take any of the performances home with you or find them anywhere else besides for Barnard media center. Hence, you are stuck on campus for hours watching these performances. As for talking to her about it, she is not sympathetic at all: she doesn't care. Same goes for group projects.

This guy might have been involved in modern music in every square foot of the world, but I guess he never came across any ideas on how to teach a university class.  You go in there every day and listen to Lewis take up an argument with one or two students, and he never gets to the core of any of the readings or illustrates any important concepts in the material. The readings range from repetitive and monotonous to pretty interesting. Alas, you're left completely in the air as to what to focus on out of all these stacks of material. Although there is a ""syllabus,"" there is no apparent  logical order in any of the topics.

Paul Olsen is the first of three professors, each teaching for one month.  Professional is a fitting description.  His presentations run like PBS documentaries.  He is an excellent speaker, and he easily combines perspectives of life from paleontology, geology and the solar system, giving a unique outlook on the Life systems of Earth.  So, not only does he know the material extremely well, he presents it with variety and style, and with video presentations.  That is a lot of work to prepare for a class, and I really appreciated that he tried to make it real and interesting.  The room used for the class is also very comfortable and cave-like, so it can be an enjoyable experience, a little like a trip through time and life.  It is a really great introduction to the subject and the other professors.  Some notes and a syllabus have been available on the Earth Institute's course website year round, so you can review them to see how you feel about it.  However, they are no substitute for the classes, obviously.  The professor is straightforward about the tasks and exams, and available for questions, so you should have no problem if you keep up with the lectures and studies.  See workload for the lab situation.  In the end I felt it was a very wothwhile class, and a privilege to be taught by a top scientist whose knowledge base has a maturity of years of research, and he conveys the richness of his understanding that if you want to learn about the Earth, I highly recommend you experience.

Lecture notes, best to review and learn immediately, since to some extent, a lot of the information builds upon the other.  But not very burdensome, and if you are inclined, you can even review these and the readings before the class begins since the information is available on their class website year-round.  Note cards for the facts work.  The big challenge for this section is getting to the museums and doing the drawings and finding out the information for the labs.  It is a fascinating adventure if you want to see it that way, and can be a lot of fun, as I had.  But it takes time to do properly, and effort, so be prepared for that, and maybe more than one visit, since it is tiring to go through a museum for more than a few hours at a time.  Fortunately, the American Museum of Natural History is free for students.  Find out how to do scientific drawings from the prof. or the TA, and find out what they want to see labelled, and you shouldn't have much problem.  They are looking for scientific observations, not fine art.  Some people took digital cameras with them and then filled out some of the details of their sketches later.  So that cut down on time spent standing or sitting around the exhibits.  Some are hard to sit by.  Altogether, very demanding assignments but very rewarding also and complementary to the lectures.  I think that in this instance, I don't think they are being overly demanding of us students.  They know why and how they are pushing the students, so that it does become a good educational experience, and I felt confident about that.

At first I was pissed that I wasn't put it Mark Carnes' reacting section, becasue I had heard such good things about him.  On the first day of class, I started to feel really pessimistic about the class because Sloan was acting incredibly arrogant, acting as though we should all be in awe of the fact hat he had written the History SAT II.  That being said, as the semester went on, things weren't bad at all.  For the most part the teacher plays an extremely minimal role in the class - just sits in the back and lets the students play the games (that's the way the course was designed), so it really doesn't make a difference if you like him or not.  Plus, he's turned out to be nicer than we all initially thought.  He's pretty lenient with papers and such, but in terms of grading, it's hard to say, because I haven't gotten any grades back yet.

3 games are played per semester, and you have to write 10 pages per game (which translates into 2 or 3 papers).

All in all, the workload was really easy, one of my easiest classes.

Prof. Griffin is another nice professional, and like the other professors, brings to the class his dedication and enthusiasm for the subject.  He is also around the world working on his tree projects, and he includes some of his work in his presentations when he covers the biology of life systems.  The labs are also interesting.  If you have done Environmental Bio I, you should have little problem with this, but if you are new to environmental biology, you need to learn quite a bit about microscopic systems such as photosynthesis, energy cycles, and have a general idea about elements that cycle in the environment, such as carbon.

Great class to take if you are interested in the Earth and ecology, want some special insights and are prepared to spend the time to do the work.  The classroom is really nice, like a cave when the lights are down.  Most of the chairs are really comfortable, and the decor is educational, with lots of Earth maps.  The first section is an excellent and unique introduction to the life of the planet at first, including the solar system, and creation of the planet, following by a month of ecology and communities of life on Earth, and then a month of life systems, including photosynthesis and elements cycling.  The professors are all experts and obviously like to teach and are good at it.  They can make complicated concepts fairly simple and understandable.  They also all have a richness of understanding to convey of their disciplines and for more detail, you can look at individual reviews I wrote for each of them.  There is a lot to learn if you have no previous substantial experience of the subject, so look at the syllabus on the website first, although it does not reflect the proper class content which you get by attending, etc.  All the professors have presentations, and these are made available on either the course website or Courseworks for download, except the videos and other odds and ends that belong to the professor's particular presentation.  They are all available for questions, within reason.  This year our TAs were excellent, and they really made the course work well, and they were available nearly all the time by e-mail, and you could see them by appointment also.  Highly recommended.  
Workload:
The workload peaks at first with the museum visits and lab work, but then drops with subsequent labs taking less time to complete and report.  However, at the end of the semester, the final may be a take-home, which also may require some work.  I think the profs decide at the beginning the semester how they will work it with the class.  We had three essays, one for each prof, to write, with some research for each one.  Also, keeping up with the main facts as you go along is a good approach, and making notecards works.  I thought the way the workload was organized that it made for a really good learning experience, so I enjoyed the hard work at the beginning and also felt that I was being immersed in the subject, so that it made the rest of the classes more meaningful and informative.  I guess to each his or her own, but I would highly recommend this class if you have the interest in the subject.

Especially if you are studying human rights, take this
class for its fascinating and sometimes surprising
perspectives into these rarely visited aspects of human
rights. This course can be a great experience, and
provide you with a powerful background when dealing
with human rights in future.  Your able guide has
prepared a wealth of readings, guest speakers and
notes - the syllabus and notes are on the professorÂ’s
website.  I agree with the other reviewers that Prof.
Moyn is brilliant, kind and a great professor.  If you are
interested, you will be inspired to work hard and the
prof is supportive and will reward you appropriately.
Also, there was some flexibility in preparing the second
paper to include our special interests.  Prof. Moyn is not
one of those teachers who assumes that because you
are in a class, you have nothing worthwhile to say.  He
really welcomes his students, and even used some of
the big class budget (for 127 students) to host those of
us interested to meet with him at very nice dinners.  Again, he is very interested, and interesting.

This is one of the best classes I've taken at Columbia. I arrived at this school cynical about the Core Curriculum requirement, and LitHum reinforced that cynicism. Contemporary Civilization had the potential to do the same, but Paul Stephens is not only passionate and knowledgeable about his subject, he also makes it relevant to current events. Not content merely to summarize the philosophies of dead white men, Paul is intent on making the subject matter come alive, which fosters spirited debate and an amazing class dynamic. 
So while Plato spends the entire length of the Meno trying to discern the meaning of ""arete"" or ""excellence,"" Paul embodies that concept from the first day of class to the final. When Paul finally gets his Ph.D. and gets out of here, it will be a great loss to CC students.

Peter Bank should NOT be teaching mathematics.  I'm sure he's an excellent mathematician, but teaching does not seem to be one of his stronger skills.  
I like math...or at least I used to.  However, after about eight weeks of calc III with this professor, I've learned to loath it.  Going to this man's class is the equivalent of hearing a more complicated version of the text book recited in a thick German accent.   Dry, boring, uninteresting, and unimaginative teaching.  I've actually given up on attending the lectures because I always end up leaving far more confused than I would be had a I just slept through it and read the material from the book.  Don't get me wrong-- it's not an unpassable course.  It's just that if you do want to pass, you can't go to class.   If you like math, don't take this class.  You'll just learn to hate it.  One plus side is that the workload isn't too bad.  It's usually one assignment collected per week, which takes maybe an hour or two, three at the most.  Add on a few hours to teach yourself the material that the professor failed to, and you're looking at maybe five or six hours per week.    Maybe more.

I disagree with the previous review of Helgeson, but perhaps because I was one of the favorites.

After a dismal first semester of CC, I was thrilled to be switching into Professor Burtt's class for the Spring upon the recommendation of the Core Director.  Prof Burtt was excellent.  She has a philosophy background and used to teach Directed Studies at Yale, which is somewhat similar to the Core. This means she knows her stuff and doesn't spend time BSing like my first professor did.  Besides having an impressive command of the material, she enthusiastically approaches grading papers with the intent of making students better writers.  I once received a paper back with comments in black, red, and pencil, meaning she had gone through it thoroughly 3 separate times.  To top it all off, she's a kind woman who seems to care about students' well being. If you're with a bad teacher, do your best to switch into Prof Burtt's class.

She's young, easy-going, a great teacher, and very accessible if you want to talk to her about your writing. 
She also has a sense of humor and doesn't get too pretentious concerning writing which is kind of rare among writing department faculty. 
Her own writing is fiction but she was great in giving fiction, script writing, and poetry equal attention in class. 
She's gives good critique, she's not overly harsh but will let you know if she thinks you can do better, and is not scared of letting you know (in a gentle way) if your writing is bad or if its just not working.
 I felt that I became way more conscious of my strenghts and weaknesses as a writer in her class, and that my writing improved vastly from it.

Professor Boerger is worth the tuition of Barnard. Prior to taking her class, I had no experience with music whatsoever. Even though I can't read a single note, Professor Boerger makes incredibly complex concepts easy to understand. Make no mistake; Intro to Music is a very difficult course, but Boerger's energy and enthusiasm is so contagious that you actually enjoy doing all the hard work. The only downside to taking Boerger's Intro to Music, is the disappointment in discovering that she doesn't teach any other course! If Professor Boerger taught trigonometry, I'd take it. Hell, given that she's the teacher I might actually enjoy and understand it!
It's such privilege to be a student of hers, and so rewarding to begin to understand and appreciate music as I feel I am having her as a teacher.

I would like to HIGHLY DISAGREE with the previous review.  I thought Professor Rafaeli to be one of the most interesting professors in Barnard.  Yes, he is nervous in class but he is very nice and willing to answer questions whenever there were any.  For the exams he was always willing to listen to students who in some cases were very arrogant and believed they were right all the time.  If he believed a question to be unfair, then he would find ways to credit those who chose the wrong answers.  The text book is dense but NOT AT ALL boring. The lectures are interesting and he allows for interaction in class.  The class is early in the morning and it was usually filled with students and I never missed a class.  I loved this class and I look forward to taking more classes with this professor

I cannot defend him enough.  I loved this class and I love him.  I never found him arrogant.  If anything, the students at this University are arrogant.

Allison is an awesome person- very young, hip, and laid-back. Her skills as a teacher are just as impressive- she is able to engage the class and keep things as interesting as possible in a class that is structured to be relatively tedious. 
Our reading selections are always fun, and discussion, while oftentimes not necessarily about how to improve our writing, is interesting and engaging. The workload is not a piece of cake, but Allison does a good job of helping you through it; she is readily available for meetings and always gives a lot of feedback.

If you are a pre-med, I strongly recommend taking Orgo with Professor Katz because from the very first lecture, he assures you that he is not your enemy and is not trying to keep you out of medical school. Personality wise, I loved Professor Katz. He kind of resembles Grandpa from ""the Munsters"" with his crazy mad scientist hair and his enthusiasm for the material. He cracks jokes, doesn't take himself seriously and he genuinely wants all of his students to get A's in orgo. The lecture before our exams, he would take the time to present us with a formal review as well as point out key concepts, reactions and mechanisms he wanted us to know for the exam. And he would post sample exams from the previous year on Courseworks, which I highly suggest you do because his exams from previous years mirrored our exams this year (he even repeats questions!). 
Unlike other reviewers, I did not get the impression that Katz was arrogant or that he didn't care about us, in fact, I found him to be quite the opposite. Katz has a huge heart and I seriously doubt the man has a mean bone in his body so if you're looking for a professor that cares about you as a student and is not out to screw you grade wise, Katz is your professor.
I would only caution people to re-think taking Orgo with Professor Katz if you are not able to work independently and figure out Orgo on your own with the textbook. Katz is an awesome guy and a great lecturer, but his teaching style might not work for everyone. Let's face it, Katz has been teaching Orgo for a LONG time and I think he sometimes forgets that a lot of us are new to the material and can't pick up things like reaction mechanisms overnight. Lecture can go by quickly and sometimes you will get lost when Katz whips through a lot of material in one lecture but thankfully, one of our TA's took thorough lecture notes and posted them on Courseworks so if you missed something in lecture, or if Professor Katz didn't explain something clearly, you could review the posted lecture notes to clarify what was covered in lecture.  Even if you do feel lost in Orgo at times, which certainly happened to me in the beginning, fear not because there comes a time around late October where Orgo just magically starts making sense and you will realize how great Professor Katz truly is and that he provided you with an excellent framework to understand Orgo. But what I really loved about this class was that your hard work does pay off, which sometimes doesn't happen in college science classes. If you really work hard, and study a lot for the exams you can easily get an A-/A in this class.  
Overall, I was happy I took this class with Katz. Getting up for a 9:00am class is a bitch and a half, but it is totally worth it and you will learn a lot about Orgo. Do the problem sets, his recommended problems, read the chapters and when you get to reaction mechanisms, make yourself flashcards. Mechanisms are difficult but you can make your life so much easier by writing out the reactions on index cards to test yourself because on exams, Katz expects you to be able to look at a structure and instantaneously know what reagents you need to make a product and how the reaction will occur. Make sure you register as soon as possible, the class fills up quickly!
 
Workload:
Not too bad. There are weekly problem sets and the number of problems vary from week to week. 4 hour long exams plus the 2 hour final and Katz drops 2 of your lowest grades. Weekly recitation quizzes, difficulty of those depends on your TA. Grading is fair, but be warned, the means are high since Katz's exams are far easier than Professor Cornish's so you have to know your reaction mechanisms perfectly and work quickly and efficiently since exams are only 50 minutes long. Make flashcards, they work wonders!

Along with his accent and lecture style, he's funny in a quirky albeit apoplectic way.

Weiman is an awful professor.  He spends his class going over the textbook reading.  Asking him questions is like getting teeth pulled; he lets you know that you are wasting his valuable time.  The lecture doesn't break up into sections, though, so if you do have questions you're kind of screwed.  My class had one TA, she was literally 70 years old.  While she was very nice, she wasn't exactly accessible...plus, she couldnt hear anything you said.  Also, the few assignments that we did have were returned about 3 weeks after their due date, since there was no one to grade them except Weiman and the old lady.
Weiman is very whiny.  He'll walk into the classroom and find his desk out of place, or a piano in front of his lectern (the room is used for music classes as well), and he'll moan, ""This is NOT in my contract.""  Then he'll call the custodian and bitch to him.

Amazing ! Dr. Hirsch is an incredibly inspiring individual and an organized, effective teacher. However, don't let the course title fool you. It focuses on a particualr topic and explores it via reading journal articles and re-creating the experiments in Hirsch's fMRI lab at Health Sciences. This course is co-taught by Dr. Hood who has a penchant for visual systems. My semester focused solely on vision; the topic itself got a little redundant, but the fMRI methodology is invaluable. if your not at all interested in vision, don't take it, because that's all the papers focus on. But you'll learn so much more from these two amazing teachers. Every week you read a few jounral articles and have to know what's going on in them, because in class you'll be expected to answer questions, explain figures, and critique methodology. it's challenging, but when the semester's done you'll be able to read and deconstruct journal articles like a pro, a must for neuroscience majors and pre-meds.

The fact that this man developed a cult following within his first week of being here should clarify what taking a class with him is like.
If you'll notice the previous review, some people just aren't going to like his course (I suspect, however, that the previous reviewer doesn't do the reading and doesn't try to talk in class).
The class functions like a forum - he will argue with given students, but it forces out problems in students' arguments, whilst supplementing the text we've read.  He will stop and take time to clarify confusing texts, and is conscious of trying to help out students to understand this rather complex subject.
That said, if you want a lecture that is organize (and which, therefore, will never explain the complexities of any situation), then this isn't for you.

Don't get me wrong, Paul is a fairly engaging and very knowledgeable professor.  The examples he comes up with are ingenious and I always marvel at them.  However, the class is DULL, DULL, DULL.  The readings are beyond tedious and I end up never doing them because every time I try I am immediately bored to tears.  A lot of them, especially those in the beginning, are impossibly convoluted.
Fortunately, Paul goes over the main points of the readings (and the things that are on the midterm/final), which is helpful because lecture notes & study groups are somewhat sufficient in studying for the midterm/final, which are difficult.  But lecture notes are hard to come by because you will mostly likely fall asleep in class (a fairly large portion does so).

Also the handouts she gives out are all there to illustrate particular elements of a narrative (background, scene, dialogue, etc.) I find it surprising that so many students found them unhelpful - after all, what can a writing teacher do?  She can't just write it for you!

warning: a highly subjective love letter of a review follows.
this class, open to undergrads and grad students, traced the development of german art ""from the rise of neoclassicism to the formulation of expressionism."" the relationship of german art to that of more-famous france and england, as well as issues of national identity and religion, were discussed at length. professor grewe is energetic, youthful, articulate, knowledgeable, and has a fabulous accent. the material covered in this class was voluminous and broad, and i was introduced to new artists and works i'd never seen before in my life every week. the readings were many, sometimes dense or obscure, but all relevant and interesting. i actually have retained to course books and packets on my shelf, a year later, because some of the material has proved so useful in my research for other art history classes, not to mention german department classes.
grewe exudes endless intelligence and love of her subject, and always seemed interested in answering questions and generally doing anything in her power to bring more information and material to us. she utilized powerpoint and many images as well as bringing in speakers and playing germa music of various periods in class. (at one point she made us stand up and sing ""deutschland ueber alles"" which i found hilarious and supertoll); i also quite enjoyed her occassional flinging about of neologisms and german terms, the meanings of which the non-german speakers in the class most likely had not a clue and had to figure it out later...haha. don't be afraid, she's a little intense but just don't be scared of her and you'll be fine. instead of being scared of her, just respect her deeply and feel lucky to have such a wonderful person from whom to learn.

I came to college convinced that I would be a philosophy major. After taking Prof. Beardman's class, I changed my mind. In fact, I plan to stay away from philosophy for quite some time.
Prof. Beardman is a really sweet, intelligent, dynamic woman who clearly enjoys what she does. At the beginning of the course, her enthusiasm was contagious. 
By the end, it just got annoying. I can't speak for everyone because I know a bunch of people who really enjoyed the class, but I for one, did not. Most of her class is dedicated to discussion, which gets even more frustrating if you have to listen to endless amateur theories given by pretentious students. It's even more frustrating if you are not big on the class participation. As a result of the large amount of discussion that takes place, I found that we didn't actually get to go over the material as much as I would have liked. Granted, Prof. Beardman will make time for you during her office hours if you want to go over certain ideas. 
Nevertheless, I think she is so intelligent and involved in her microcosm of philosophy that she is never quite ""there."" I would have prefered more of a lecture-based class with a clearer sense of structure. 
I definietly feel ambivalent about this class. Prof. Beardman herself is a great woman who is extremely smart and always in a good mood. But I find her teaching style better suited for graduate level courses. Take her class if you like talking. Just remember that you will ultimately be competing with the other big talkers in the class--not just about who makes the more brilliant comment, but about how brilliantly it is delivered as well. 
Workload:
Not too bad, although I found that we rushed through too many philosophers in too short of a time. She's not the easiest grader either, but you will find her extremely fair. Her two papers don't allow much room for creativity (so if you think your the next Aristotle and want to simply talk about those brilliant theories of yours, stick to the discussions in class and keep the papers nice and dry).

I hated this class, and at least half the reason was the teacher.  I seriously have never hated a class more. It's a bit misleading for the other reviewers to say that the grading was a little tough (in my opinion); I'd rather say the grading was sporadic and unpredictable. She would write comments on my drafts like ""excellent point"", ""natural storyteller"", ""original thinker"", and would tell me my drafts were very strong, and then would give my papers B- (when I was getting A- on papers for all my other classes). Not to say that it isn't an instructors perrogative to grade as they wish, but I have a deep enmity for what she looks for in a paper. She could care less about content; it's form that matters to her--not even style, but form. Being a jounalist, she wanted all of our papers to be written as though they were newspaper articles, no tolerance (or understanding from what I could tell) of other forms or styles. So she'll be great for you if you want to be a journalist--not knocking her there.                                           But if you like writing literary analysis papers, and don't use ""snazzy verbs"" and ""attention grabbing phrases"" you don't have a chance in hell of getting anything above a B. I disagree that her comments were helpful, because they were only helpful for the things she looked for--things to keep the reader's attention. Which, I supposed is helpful, but I don't know any other class where my use of colorful (read: uncommon) words was more important than the thoughts or points I developed. On the last paper in the class, when I finally gave in and wrote the paper she wanted (in half the time I spent on any other paper for that class), I finally got a B+.  UW is a terrible class, regardless, but teachers can certainly make it worse--and she did.

The one-sentence summary? Jervis is wasted on the first-years. I took Intro to IR as a freshman and fell asleep regularly every week. the TA made the class bearable, and I did pick up what I was supposed to, but I didn't leave with a good impression of Professor Jervis himself. 
Two years later I took Conflict and Coop with him, and fell in serious academic crush with the man. I'd trot eagerly to class first thing Monday morning (and I'm not a morning person) to sit and hear his amusing expositions on The State Of The World Today / The State Of Today's Headlines. witty AND incisive, they cut through the crap and helped shed valuable light on what was actually taking place. every time I read about a new political development I'd want to hear what Jervis would have to say about it in the next class. The lectures were for the most part just as insightful and interesting (though I'd be lying if I said I didn't doze off even once). Reading was on the heavy side but all good selections. The grading wasn't easy, but I felt like I worked for and earned what I eventually got - and unlike so many classes, I actually took increased knowledge away with me at the end of the semester.
Bottom line: the man deserves his reputation. Definitely consider taking one of his classes if/when you're not a freshman any more, and better able to appreciate what he's saying. A genuine interest in the world around you also helps.

VERY intimidating professor, can be a total bully, but he does take some very respectable positions on the American political system.  I wasn't blown away by any of his insights, and I thought he graded too much on what you can prove you read rather than on the depth of your understanding or analysis.  Still, this is one of the best classes on American politics in the department; it's just that if you think American politics is slimy and evil, this class will probably reinforce such beleifs.

photo-cropping, indeed, is a delicate task, one requiring mental concentration, visual acuity, and sensitivity of touch. the blade's trajectory is the fine line of infinitesimal width resting between
positive and negative space, between the pitch-black within the frame and the absolute white without. where the blade travels, Presence and Absence are split from the whole. obviously, the philosophical potential here is boundless, or at least as boundless as its boundlessness is obvious--what is a photograph's being? what is the being of its logicographical opposite, viz. the nonphotograph? what is the being of one being in the being of the other? what is the being of the being of one and the being of the other being in its entirety subsumed into the being of the sum of the being of the one and the being of the other?--yet the severance is so immediate, so silent, that it seems to disencourage meditation, or even threatens to flee the memory of its effector.
i know not now to express my feeling in words, but a tension invariably and incessantly plagues me as i shove the materiality of Absence (the unwanted edges) into the blue trash can, and as i glue the materiality of Presence (the cropped photograph) to yet another, albeit smaller, materiality of Absence (the white page of the notebook): am i saving ink, or am i wasting paper? alas, a kind of hell, a kind of heaven, the graph and the letter merged into one, then reduced to none.

No review is more informative than an except from a typical lecture by Prof. Yeung, a devout stylistic and intellectual follower of a certain well-known poststructuralist thinker: ""This assymetry of binary oppositions incessantly disrupts, disengages, and, at last, destroys the weaker of the pair. The sole metaphysical escape that the impossible has from the overwhelming sea of the possible is to withstand ejaculation, then reinject itself into
the possible, and finally subversively overturn the dominance granted to it by imperfect human grammar, thereby freeing the subjective floating signifier within the sign from the omnipresent threat of verbal castration by distending the reflexive signification of the former. This difficulty is, at last, precisely the same difficulty
that hordes of modern phenomological philosophers of  language tried to tackle and failed--how can two entities be at once disparately different and desperately similar? How can sameness and difference be same or different if the sameness of or difference between the very concepts of sameness and difference is doubted, even challenged? And yet the cause of this apparent difficulty, as I have demonstrated above, is a confusion--due to, I might add, an especially obnoxious
kind of mental laziness that plagues sadly many of my colleagues--so simple that it approaches the point of sheer idiosy: understanding the words ""possible"" and ""impossible"" as opposites detaches the mind from the obvious reality that, rather than two ends of a stick balanced in the middle, they are much more like a line of infinitesimal width cut out from a pie versus the rest of that pie...""

Professor Bakhle is, to say the least, a formidable woman. Her lecture style is impeccable, delivering enormous amounts of information in a fashion easy to assimilate and remember. True, she's a bit of a hard-ass, and clearly takes herself pretty seriously (make sure your cell phone/computer is off before class starts, don't let yourself fall asleep, and don't be late). But she more than makes up with it with her engaging method of speaking and laser-like focus on her subject. That said, I felt there was a fair degree of bias on her part against what she labelled as ""Hindu nationalist histories"" (a concept that was never actually explained) or ""imperialist"" histories, and in favor of Muslims and the Mughal Empire in general. However, compared to the other professors in the department, she's a shining beacon of objectivity. Overall, an excellent professor.

The problem with Prof Beer's tests wasn't even so much that they were difficult, unpredictable, and often vaguely worded, but that the number of mistakes in the question statements and his later refusal to admit said errors rendered the tests impossible to complete. I don't believe that he managed to write a single exam in either semester that didn't have at least one major error in it that was caught either during the test (after most students had expended a lot of time fruitlessly struggling to solve it) or afterwards, when the TA went over the exam in recitation.
Perhaps it would have helped if prof beer actually came up with an answer key instead of handing off that task to the TA  after the test had been administered or even if he had just, you know, read over the exam once before giving it. 
The worst example came up during one of the later exams of the second session when he provided a table of data which did not include the necessary information to solve the problem because he'd copied the wrong stuff. When this was brought to his attention after the TA and class discovered it while going over the test solutions during recitation, did Beer throw the question out or give the points to everyone free? No and no. He had the TA grade the question according to ""how much it looked like the student would have been able to answer it had the table been correct."" What the hell is that?

I have to strongly disagree with the one critical review of Adriana. I am very surprised because I thought that actually, she really let the music speak for itself. 
She spends a lot of time generating discussion on the class' reaction to the music. She would teach the technical stuff, but she would keep it simple and understandable. If you know a lot about music history and theory, then you're probably not going to enjoy this class. Adriana is teaching this class to people who really don't know anything about music, and want an interesting class. She allows you room to explore and apply yourself to the work, if you want, but if you really just want an easy A, then she'll give that to you too. I find her extremely engaging and knowledgable (although I'm no music history expert and I can't verify every fact that she says, I'll have to say that when people did challenge her on questions, she never shut them down). The one long paper in the class was analyzing a classical piece used in any movie, and she wanted emphasis on how the music conveys emotion of the movie/scene that it is paired with. I had a lot of fun with the paper and I definitely have a newfound appreciation for ancient, classical and contemporary music.

The best guy to take for ear training, especially if you consider yourself to have a pretty good ear already (hint: you don't). Alex is really smart, a good composer and an AMAZING jazz improviser, though he's super-modest about all of these things. He's also just really cool, like you'd wanna hang out with him in your spare time, which I'm not sure is something we'd say about Francoise (thought that's not fair- I've never had her except once as a substitute for Alex- what a weirdo!)
Alex has a very broad approach to ear-training- all music, everything, is just sounds, vibrartions in the air. A semester with Alex and he will have you listening for the overtones in a humming air conditioner. So expect to listen to a lot of really modern ugly music but to learn to appreciate it. Alex will also totally turn around and whip out a Bach chorale or even some medieval/ Renaissance stuff. You also do practice with extremely complex irregular rythms and cool jazz harmonies! I feel like I've understated Alex's coolness. He's really REALLY cool. And Brazillian.

This was one of the most unbelievable classes I have ever taken in my life!  First of all, the material is incredible.  As I learned this semester, French Caribbean literature is both well-written and full of substance (unlike the French literature of France, which tends to be excessively verbose, flowery, and about nothing in particular).  It was wonderful to learn about something so obscure - I would not know anything about Haitian history and politics, if it were not for this class.  The material aside, Kaiama herself is an amazing professor.  She is extremely knowledgeable about her subject, yet full of the youthful passion that not many scholars have today.  She cares wholeheartedly about her class and her students.  She wants everyone to not only understand the material, but also to come up with their own ideas about the texts.  The class is very intimate, and even though it is a lecture, the small number of students makes for a very discussion-oriented seminar-style class.  You cannot get away without having done the majority of the reading (I don't know why you wouldn't want to though, it's very good!!!).  Students are expected to participate actively at all times and it is difficult to fudge having read an obscure Haitian book.  Grading is very fair (even on the generous side).  Everyone who is capable of taking this class should.  It is a pity not more people speak French, so that they can appreciate the amazingness that is Kaiama's class!!!

Where do I begin?  First off, he likes to spend most of his time talking about what he'd like to do instead of doing it.  Most time is spent listening to him talk about things unrelated to the class at hand or teaching italian.  If you're looking to breeze by in italian... this is your class!  If you're looking to actually LEARN Italian, avoid this class.
Second... he's a frist class creep.  I have experienced first hand his inappropriate behavior.  If you are a guy... you may want to try taking another course where you don't risk being subjected to his inappropriate attempts at checking you out or making inappropriate comments to you inside and outside the class-- or worse yet, when he tries finding ways to touch you while you're doing work.  It was a nauseating experience, and one I wish I hadn't been subjected to.  Why is the Italian department STILL employing a man who can't control his sexual appetite, and worse yet... can't teach! The females, oddly enough, either loved him (becuase he was so ""sweet"" to them) or hated him (because they didn't kiss up to him).  If you can avoid his classes, then do so-- and if you can't avoid his classes-- then don't take Italian at all since he'll most likely ruin the experience for you one way or another.

She is amazing.  Her material will challenge and satisfy you no matter what level dancer you are.  The class is release-y, yoga-y and ""athletic"" (aka go on the floor and put weight into your hands sometimes).  She is really sweet and really will watch you dance and offer helpful comments.  The other great thing about the class is that she is an absolutely AMAZING dancer and young enough to still really throw herself around, so just watching her is very inspiring.

This class seemed normal enough when i was picking it...but i knew it was all downhill the first class.  I have no idea what the class was actually about because the reading was incomprehensible and when you could decode the meaning excrusiatingly boring.  The discussions were student-led, which is a code word for disorganzied and filled with frequent awkward silences.  The papers were graded completely arbitrarily, so it doesn't make any sense to spend any actual time working on them...he'll probably hate it either way.  The only way to suceed is to mercilessly kiss ass...its what he responds to best.  he makes you buy three course readers at random points throughout the semester-
the readings are horrible and only one person will actually do them so don't waste your money and let that one sucker in the class answer his inane questions.  He'll ask for feedback during the last class but don't be fouled..he'll cut you down for any minor criticism.  In a class of about 12 at least 5 people burst into tears due to his insensitivity and general assholishness.

John Glendinning has debilatating issues.  His exams are totally ambiguous.  You'll do well as long as you can read his mind.  Any misinterpretation of exam questions basically ends in the student being inarguably wrong and stupid for not thinking in Glendinnian twilight zone.
I honestly don't know how he even got a job teaching.  He is probably the worst professor I have had in my years at Columbia (next to Prof. Fine - Chemistry).

A first year prof, you can tell immediately. Tries very hard to make basic calculus easy to understand (does a pretty good job at it, I think). Others might disagree as to his writing down every single word in english like we're in kindergarten. 
Sometimes that would be helpful though. I would recommend his class just because he can speak english very clearly (in britspeak!). Doesn't curve but that's because his tests are fairly doable.

I completely agree with all the wonderful things that were said about her.  While I was at the lectures I didn't even realize how much I was getting out of them.  This year I'm studying Victorian lit at Oxford, and it's amazing how much easier it is for me to analyze even the books I hadn't read before, just because Amanda really teaches us how to analyze.  I can now make connections I never could have made if this were my first time taking this subject.  I had never really practiced her type of analysis before: Instead of a thematic analysis, we do a structural one in which we learn how the book is put together.  While that can seem limiting and sometimes not as interesting, it's incredible how much easier it is to do thematic analysis after practicing taking apart the structure so many times.  Not only is Amanda brilliant, but she's such a nice person.  I was so nervous when I went to talk to her at office hours, but she made me feel so comfortable and went out of her way to make me feel relieved and good about myself walking out.  This has definitely been the most rewarding class I've taken at Columbia.
Workload:
It's really not that bad.  The books are long, as Victorian novels tend to be: Mansfield Park, Jane Eyre, Bleak House, Middlemarch, Jude the Obscure, Picture of Dorian Gray, and Heart of Darkness...but we only have one essay, a midterm, and a final.  The midterm was graded very easily: I didn't time it well and only had 4 minutes to write the third essay (which obviously turned out horribly) and still managed to get an A.  The essay was graded fairly.  If you have any interest at all in this era of literature, definitely take this class.

However, if you have already fulfilled your math requirements, and are just taking this class for the hell of it, really make sure it's what you want to do...it's NOTHING like Calculus I, and you might regret taking it.

Contrary to rumors, this class wasn't bad at all.  Lectures were very interesting: he often used real-world examples to illustrate his arguments.  Sometimes he would go overboard with the math, but only for lectures--you didn't need to know the advanced material for problem sets or for the exam.  In general, the math was really, really simple--straight out of calculus.  I had a good time in this course--Prof. Onatski explains concepts very well, and makes a sincere effort to answer students' questions.

This class was hell.  Not because it was difficult--not at all, it was appallingly simplistic.  The amount of work required for this class was unbelievable.  Basically, everything you need to know for this class is taught in the first two weeks:  draw the graph, take the derivative (which is always y/x ), set it equal to the slope of the line, and plug in the numbers.  Admittedly, sometimes there are variations (there could be two curves! sometimes you have to work backwards!).  But that was THE ENTIRE CLASS: solving the same exact problem, over and over and over and over again...in the extremely long problem sets...in the extremely long midterm and exam...and in the lectures, with her combative style of teaching.  If you can figure out how to do this one problem (and you'll have many chances to practice), the only difficulty of this course will be getting all of those problem sets done on time.  But if you can't, go to recitations: the TAs all but do the problem set for you (often, only the numbers are different). And don't even bother with the book, it's utterly useless (way too advanced, and written abstrusely).

This was a great class.  Although I had no background in music, Todd explained the material very well.  The class was heavily discussion-based, which made things much more interesting than if he had just been lecturing.  He also touched on more advanced material, instead of keeping the class to basic definitions.  Contrary to what some other reviews here say, he did make it clear what we were studying--he gave handouts of IDs and things to know for the exam, which made studying much easier.

This was one of the best classes I have taken at Columbia.  First of all, it is small, more like a CC or Lit Hum class than a lecture class.  It is also discussion-based:  instead of lecturing on and on, like other EALAC professors do, he involves the entire class, and seems genuinely interested in what you have to say.  He's also full of funny stories.  The difficult part of the class is the breadth of the material:  there is a lot of reading (on par with CC or Lit Hum), and it covers an immense amount of material.  (This adds variety to the class though, because the more random readings are really pretty interesting).  If you do the reading, you'll have a great time in this class.

I would have to say my best teacher this semester and a great year to start off my first year at Columbia.  She is one of the most enthusiastic teacher I've ever had and loves all the material she covers.  She takes the time to explain concepts she feels are important and tries really hard to get us interested by creating powerpoint slideshows and even making a few hands on experiments that make it easier to understand the concepts.  She is a very accessible teacher and is nice and organized.  Her office hours are very helpful and she's prompt about answering emails.  She even gives progress reports, a rare plus among college professors.  Be sure to pick Cottrell if you're looking for a very passionate, organized, and overall, just awesome Frontiers of Science professor.

DEFINITELY the BEST professor I ever had at Columbia.  At the same time, he was definitely the HARDEST professor I ever had at Columbia.  I took computational complexity last semester and it was the hardest class I had taken.  However, because he was such a great professor, I decided to take computational learning theory, and now i can say that that is the hardest class I've ever taken.   However, if you're not afraid to face the challenge, you will find that he is an excellent teacher, and you will definitely learn a lot.  I definitely don't consider myself a very motivated learner, but I  think the hard work was worth it for these classes.

The styles of the problem sets were very similar in both classes (even though they pertain to very different subject matter).  In either class, you will have biweekly problem sets which will each probably take you several days to complete.   They consist of about 6 problems, and they are definitely not easy.  Your homeworks are to be typed up in LaTeX, and just to give you a general idea, mine averaged something like 7 pages each.  Computational complexity had 7 problem sets and a take home final which was basically just another problem set weighted heavier.  Computational learning theory had 5 problem sets and a final project, which is yours to come up with.

I felt completely differently about this class than the previous reviewer. Prof. Crane usually had only one or two things to say about the texts, and then she would belabor the point to fill up the class time. She tried to make the lecture dission based, but she usually couldn't answer students' questions and was sometimes even left bewildered when they corrected her.  She didn't seem to know how to steer the discussion in interesting directions, so the class ended up with a very surface analysis of almost every text.

While many seem to think his Science of Psych course is boring and deficient, the small seminar setting of his Education Eval. course really brings out the humor, interest and genius of this professor.  It was really touching and encouraging to hear that after a full and amazing lifetime ( I won't spoil any stories for those intending to take this class, but boy does he have some great ones) he has decided that the most important thing to do in life is to try and figure out how to teach others correctly.  While he by no means attempts to say he knows how this is to be done, the class is all about researching and exploring different measurements and techniques to try and get closer to determining the ""correct"" way of teaching from birth on, touching on issues such as socio-economic, gender, race differences, IQ and ""intelligence.""

To being with, Berofsky is HILARIOUS. The casual way in which he makes hilariously ironic comments was enough to keep classes entertaining. 
In terms fo teaching style, Berofsky is admittedly somewhat dry, but he knows his stuff and does his best to make complex texts  and concepts acessible to his students. The course structure, esp in Methods&Problems, was very condusive to giving a broad, general understanding the main currents of philosophy, and while doing the reading is necessary, readings were short and concentrated on the main issues at hand-basically, while you will be somewhat lost if you don't do the reading, if you do it, you'll find that Berofsky's lectures provide answers to the very questions/parts of the text that you had found particularly difficult. In the advanced course, the same holds true. Also, in that class, Berofsky always left time during transition points in the lecture for students to ask questions, but beware, he will challenge you, and force you to think.
Overall, I have TRULY enjoyed my classes with Berofsky; my expxerience in methods&problems spurred my decision to major in philosophy and his class on free will has made that topic the focus of my interests in philosophy. I would HIGHLYrecommend him to anyone who has a real desire to understand and as he says ""do"" a little philosophy of their own. Philosophy classes aren't meant to be easy, but Berofsky succeeds in making his accessible and engaging.

Someone needs to provide some qualification to all the reviews of Prof Goehr which portray her as a God. Goehr knows her stuff and her lectures do make some good points, but by the end of the two hour period, it was pretty clear from one glance around the class that at least 50-75% were sleepy, tired and itching to get out of the class.... In other words, she's DEFINITELY not the best lecturer I've heard. Also, while I always had pleasant personal encounters with Prof. Goehr, I found her to be a bit full of herself-she knows her stuff but she also knows that she knows it.

Prof Cornish is brilliant and a good lecturer, but her tests are too hard and she blames poor results on the students, which is not fair.

Wow. Andrea Borghini might be the absolute worst professor I've had at Columbia yet. It pains me to say so, because he's such a nice guy. He's from Florence and speaks and understands English well, even though he has a heavy accent and tends to mumble a lot. I think this may be part of the reason the class is so terrible...maybe he is not very confident in speaking much, and therefore most of the class has absolutely no focus whatsoever and is filled with students giving their random thoughts about the readings and their opinions on life in general. I had an amazing Lit Hum professor last year, so it amazes me how this guy could be so bad. He seems like he doesn't prepare anything for class. 
The worst is that half the time we honestly sit there in the room doing nothing, he'll just be staring out with a blank look on his face, apparently thinking of something to say in Italian in his head and then translating it to English. Or he'll have his head down looking through his book trying to think of something to say or of a question to ask about the reading. He told us he has been at Columbia for four years...we can all only hope that his career will not continue on to a fifth. The worst part is, on top of all this terrible teaching, lack of preparation, etc. (oh did I mention that he was late to the first few classes, but then a few classes later he yelled at the class for people being a couple minutes late?? also he ALWAYS goes beyong the actually class time by at least 5 minutes, wasting even more of our time)    he is a VERY HARSH GRADER!

I think that the other reviews on this page have been pretty unfair to Prof. Neumann.  He is an extremely warm man who loves the subject that he teaches.  I've never experienced any sort of disorganization on his part--the syllabus and all of the problem sets are posted online (pretty straightforward, if you ask me), and the sets are always graded and ready to pick up within a week of turning them in.  His TA is definitely a difficult grader, but Neumann himself does not seem to be so harsh (he graded my midterm, and I didn't get points taken off on a couple of questions that the TA graded wrong on others' tests).  I understand everything he teaches us in class--there are plenty of examples, and he will stop to answer questions.  He is probably one of the only Calculus III teachers who speaks English without a horrible accent (his is British--very easy to understand).  Additionally, his exams are (so I've gathered) the easiest out of the entire Calc III department--most of the questions are easier than those in the assigned book work!

It generally took me close to the full 3 hours to finish the lab, but why shouldn't it - that is the time that the course is alotted - I was rarely was pressed for time even though I stayed the full 3 hours.  In addition, I rarely went to physics lab library to prepare - the maximum amount of times I went was 2 and it was only to glance at the experiment for a few minutes.

Take his class!  Yes, he's a conservative writer but for a semi-intro writing class I think this is a good thing.  By conservative, I mean that in short stories he wants a beginning, middle and end, a theme and a resolution of sorts.  Everyone in the class is not yet a published novelist, so I think it's important to learn the structure of a story in this class.  
Berlin's comments are always great, and he really knows how to help you out.  He makes himself accessible an hour before & after class, and moderates the workshopping well.  While the level of excitement in the class depends on the students (and their writing), Berlin is always interesting and makes great observations.
I've really learned a lot from his class and I think I've improved a lot since S&S I.  In the meantime, read his novel, Belmondo Style (which you can borrow from the writing center) and you'll understand his comments and writing style better.  
In a word, he likes your writing to be REAL.  He wants you to struggle with the words, and even put yourself into your work so that it feels closer for the reader.  Take his class.  You'll love it.

Not bad.  2 poems (any length aside from haikus), 1 short story (~8page min, though he sets no official minimum), 2 consecutive scenes from a play (4-6pg total).

Park-sensei is a pretty good professor. She's really adorable and funny and she gives a lot of cute anecdotes about the cultural differences between Japan and America. Her lecture style is a bit dry and repetitive, and she teaches off of slides instead of writing on the board so grammar nuances can go by a little too quickly. You will spend ridiculous amounts of time learning grammar but not so much with vocab and basically no practice for the killer translations on the exams so beware. Other than that, she tries to get you to learn Japanese in the most straightforward way possible and is a very efficient instructor.

Oleg is an excellent lab instructor.  He gave informative lectures before the lab that highlighted key points we needed to know throughout the lab.  He always answered all of our questions and was both knowledgeable and friendly.  He makes a boring lab as painless as possible.

After reading the other reviews of this professor, I felt compelled to write one. I am a) a Barnard student, b) a non-English major, and c) I had before this class never taken one with Professor Weinstock. Despite these things she was always friendly, made an effort to remember my name and always asked after me both directly before and outside of class. I got the feeling that she really cared about me and how I did in class, and that she felt that way about everyone. She made an effort to include not only the louder or more proficient readers of Middle English in ways suited to their ability.
It was very easy for me to read and understand the Middle English, but I never had to do so out loud, in class, unless I volunteered (I never did). I also felt like my contributions and questions were both welcome and well answered. In short, I loved Professor Weinstock, and would take another class with her in a heartbeat if I didn't hate literature classes. That said, I enjoyed her class and she even let me write papers from a historical/social perspective.

Thad is terrific. I loved him as a professor, he was great on a personal level, and, despite his height and presence, he is easy to talk to, even if you disagree with what he says.
His lectures are interesting and interactive, and the readings he assigns add greatly to the class.
That said, he is biased like none other. This may be part of what makes him a good lecturer, but it is definitely something to keep in mind while taking his class; but, on the upside, at least you know exactly where he stands.

This class was incredibly interesting and a lot of fun. I took it the first time it was taught, and so, while it was a lecture, only 7 people were in the class, and it felt like a seminar. This may also be due to the HUGE amount of reading that Sloan assigns. 
I learned so much from this class, and liked Sloan a lot, he makes many slightly off-color but amusing remarks and is easily sidetracked onto almost any topic. He encourages class participation, and isn't above jumping into the fray in a particularly heated debate. Although, no matter how cool he is in class, he'll try to pretend he doesn't know you if he sees you outside, which is a bit weird.

Under no circumstances should you take this course. None. Professor Albert is a terrible lecturer who lets questions from students, valid or not, drive the entire lecture. This and the repetetive nature of the class made it a daily fight not to skip. He also focuses on details of little or no importance and skates right over those that are critical.
The midterm is completely unrepresentative of the substance of the class, and his examples are exactly out of the book (which he wrote) so you never get a clearer picture by asking him to explain. Unless you are extremely well versed in Physics, Philosophy, or both, you will get below a B- in this class. There is no homework to prepare you for the math-based take home midterm, and recitation is at a time that made it impossible (at least when I took it) for an observant Jew to attend.
I learned more in researching for the final paper than I did from the entire class. I also felt like Professor Albert focused almost entirely on the Physics aspect and not at all on the Philosophy. I would have liked to see more exploration of what the discoveries meant for contemporary Philosophy, rather than just seeing the experiments and learning that they caused questions.

Professor Worman is a good teacher.  Bright, likeable, but definately not someone to mess with.  We spend the semester translating Plato's Ion which is interesting if you like Socratic dialogue.  I found the homework assignments tedious at times.  My major complaint about the class was the schedule.  We would have friday morning classes with the TA and there would usually be homework due or a quiz.  Having essentially two teachers equals a lot of work.  Both were fair graders with reasonable expectations.  Basically this class just requires a lot of time to do well in.  Grammer points are discussed at length during class but you really need to just open Hansen and Quin yourself. Prepare yourself to spend Thursday night in your room studying, and if you do that you will do well in the class.

This was a great class.  McCaskill is always engaging.  She is nice to her students and always takes time to hear everyone's comments.  The material itself is fascinating, though it is not necessary to keep up with the readings to do well - usually the outlines she provides, lecture notes, and skimming the chapters will be enough.  Her tests are fair, mostly multiple choice and short answer.  When she feels she has designated too many chapters to a particular test, she will reduce the amount of material rather than make students cram material that has not been covered.  She is exceptionally warm and friendly.  This is one of those magical classes that didn't stress me out but still made me learn a lot.

Tamar is hilarious. The event that best describes her occured when a student was late to class (it was slated for 10-10:50 and he arrived at 10:07) and she congratulated him on his progress, as he had arrived at 10:10 the day before, she said at this rate, he'd be on time in a few more days. She is very cute, and always chipper, an Israeli of the old school.
Class is mercifully short (only 50 minutes) but she fills it with LOTS of grammar, and not as much vocab as one would hope. The class had a broad cross-section of experience and ability, which added to the challenge of teaching us, but Tamar seemed to do well, and cared about your individual progress, requesting private meetings when she felt that there was a concept that needed to be explained, but she didn't want to waste the classes' time.

Okay, in terms of scheduling, this class meets only once a week, but for four hours.  There were times when I wondered if I would make it out alive or awake.  That said, Professor Regan does give a five minute break either before or after the feature film and generally looks the other way when you sneak in food as long as it is not too noisy or offensive.  Now as for the class itself:  the movies are great, a really wide variety, and the professor does seem to really enjoy and care about what she teaches.  Discussion can be painful at times, but this class was overall a pretty good experience.  Professor Regan is pretty fair grader, but she takes off if your paper or test does not cover all possible aspects of the questions - in other words, she likes answers to be very thorough.

   I am currently in this class as well, however I disagree with some of the points made by the previous review. If you want to learn something completely new, something completely unexpected that you would never have thought of in a million years, this class is far from DULL . Every thing I have learned in this class has blown me away. This is what college is for!
    The work load is not too heavy, but the reading is dense, especially in the beginning but don't lose hope! At first i was literally reading the passages three times because it seemed to be in a different language. This said,  Prof. kockleman really hits the important points in the lecture and breaks up these readings that ramble on for fifteen pages into about three sentences. He also tells you specific things to note about the reading ahead of time, so that you are not completely frustrated or bogged down. 
    Prof. Kockleman is very entertaining and engaging, very passionate about his subject and about teaching you this material. He is also approachable, always addressing the class of about 120 with a ""hey gang!"" , and willing to answer any question in class (no matter how stupid it seems to the rest of the audience).
    As to falling asleep in class, well thats your own problem. I wouldnt recommend it because you will miss a lot. Besides it is fairly difficult to fall asleep when you are engaged and interested in the material and paying attention. 
    The only complaint about this class were the TA's. There were three that so far have only taught twice and it seems that only one of them knows what is going on. The second cannot speak English very well and doesn't speak loudly enough which is a shame bc the first day I sat in the back and was very annoyed but the next day I sat in the front and he actually had really good points and examples. The last just acted annoyed with us all the time when we asked her to speak up bc she mumbled the entire time. 
   Beacuse of this class, I want to be an Anthro major or at least a minor!!! I cannot promise you will like this class, obviously the previous review did not. Like any class and professor it is a matter of personal preference. But look at how many good reviews there are and then how many negative ones, and hopefully if you take the class you will not be disappointed.
Workload:
   Very dense reading at first- dont let it scare you! It definately gets better. You can get away without doing all of it bc the prof goes over  it in a much more conprehensible style. This said, when it is time for the midterm, you will want to have at least have known who said what and be able to reference them. 
   Be careful of the pop quizes!! The prof went out of town for a week. The first class the TA's taught was completely boring (the first and only  time so far I fell asleep) so a lot of ppl skipped the second class. But !danger! there was a pop quiz on the in-class notes from that lecture. So just watch out, there are two per semester and they are collectively 20% of the grade.
   I can't speak about the final yet, I havent had it, but the midterm was tidily comprehensive and very very fair even though I didnt do very well on it. Really know the concepts inside and out. It is really like learning another language. There is a lot of material, but its incredibly fascinating!!

Welcome to the worst class you will ever take, taught by the worst professor you will ever have.  After a semester with chemistry god Breslow, this class is an unbelievable let down.  Monday and Wendesday mornings will become the bane of your existence, because this semester you HAVE to go to class.  The curriculum is a hopelessly disorganized combination of the textbook, Sames's lectures, very difficult problem sets, and incomprehensible journal articles; the overlap between these is minimal, so studying for tests is nearly impossible.
Sames's lecturing style is also very disorganized.  He explains reactions by giving examples on the board. However, rather than picking basic examples, he picks the most complex examples he can come up with (you will be drawing rings until you would gladly shoot a benzene molecule on sight), so that way you will never know what the actual reaction is.  In fact, he will make relatively easy reactions needlessly complicated, seemingly just for the sake of confusing bewildered students (those who are still awake - I promise you, there will not be many.)  His monotone accent, combined with the 9am class time and the poor lecturing style, make it virtually impossible to stay awake.
And then there's the grading.  Major, major ouch. The means for the 3 midterms were in the 50s and 60s.  About half the class dropped after the first midterm.  I am NOT a grade-grubbing pre-med, and I can definitely say that this was the hardest class I have ever taken.  The final was almost hilarious because it was so ridiculously hard; i say almost, because it also counted as 60% of our grade.  I got an A+ first semester in Breslow's class, and despite working considerably harder second semester, I got a B.
Overall, it's still worth taking this class; you won't have to take gen. chem., you get 6AP credits, and you get orgo out of your way freshman year.  The price you pay, however, is a semester of pain and misery.  I am friends with a lot of people who took that class, and they pretty much all agree: Sames is awful.

I find hillarious reading other reviews of professor Lindemann, because for most part they are exaggerated. I would tell you: she is not as bad as she appears to be. She is concentrated on making you understand the material that is already easy and straightforward. She is not one of these professors that bullshit alot about nothing. Her lectures are well organized and presented on the powerpoint. If you miss the class, you can still acess them online. There are no midterms or finals in that class. There are 3 tests, each covers the third of the class material. These tests fairly test your understandng of the material:is fair: 50 multiple choice that are based on the book, and 10 common-sence short answer questions based on the class notes. 
What I would admit is that she is weird, but it is no harm to you at all. She tries HARD to be funny, but if someone laughs at her jokes, they do so just cuz they are trying to be nice. Once she tripped on the extension cord, but in order to ease the embarasement she started dancing something inbetween the electric slide and polka. By the end of the semester, you would learn the names of her two kids (Rebecca and Jordan), the profession of her housband, and a whole bunch of other ""girl talk""
I would strongly advice you to take this class though. Patricia is a very nice lady, who is open to after class discussions. Feel free to email her with whatever you are concerned about.

This was honestly the easiest class I have ever taken. Like evry one else in Art Hum, I was simly hoping to learn a little bit about Art HIstory and how it all fit together, write a few papers, and get one step closer to finishing up the Core. Lindsey Koval was a pleasant surprise. She has the energy and enthusiasm of an undergraduate, and, not once, in a dark classroom at 7 o'clock at night did I fall asleep or get even close to falling asleep. Her passion and understanding of art and art history makes the class interesting, plus, she makes allusions to pop-culture that are a welcome break from dark brrooding Rembrandts. I have to say, that other than two papers a mid term and a final, I never thought about this class until I was sitting looking at slides. There is absolutely no outside reading, though she will recommend passages and texts to you if you are interested. 
    Her only drawback is that she can seem a bit flakey, canceling class at the last minute. It is obvious that this class is not her first priority, but why should it be? (Plus, a cancelled class is a must need break / celebration)
   I would very much stress getting Lindsey Koval for a prof. She is interesting and very understanding and willing to help, extend deadlines. Furthermore, just because she talks quickly and has obviously read the latest edition of US Weekly does not mean she is stupid.

Everything you write is going to be torn apart and rearranged into her thoughts, her ideas, her views. It doesn't matter how long you work on your essay it just depends on what mood you catch her in when she's grading it. Grading is tough in this class, very tough.

Jeffrey Said is a great professor. He clearly has an exceptional command of the material because when he walks into class he glances at the text and is able to teach full lessons. He is very reasonable about homework and tests. From what I see his philosophy is ""if you do well on the tests, you clearly know the material well, which is the goal of my class"". This means that if you are not big on doing homework he will take care of you. On the other hand if you get nervous doing tests and sometimes underperform, he will take care of you ""if you do all of your homework and put forth a noticable effort"". He makes jokes all of the time during class and also offers a tremendous amount of time for extra help. Jeffrey Said wants his students to learn math. That is the bottom line.

Very competent, but slightly emotionally distant, teacher. By that I'm not saying she's mean--far from it. She's a actually pretty nice person at base. (She brought us candy from Japan one class.) It's more like she's always preoccupied and a little flustered, and so she may seem hard to approach in an academic setting. I doubt she has a thing against ignorant undergraduates. (Though I wouldn't be thrilled to teach Art Hum either.) I think that's just the way she is. Also, she's probably very busy trying to get tenure, etc.  On the plus side, she loves and knows her shit. She's generally organized; her articles are among the clearest I've read in art history courses. She's pretty lax about deadlines as long as you don't act ridiculously. In short, a good teacher, but probably hard to befriend.
This class has some logistical problems (see ""Workload""). But with some modifications, it would be absolutely fabulous. We're basically cutting into the heart of a thousand years of high Japanese culture by focusing on Genji and cultural products inspired by it, including manga and some GREAT 20C literature. The Tale is superbly poignant, and the whole Japanese aesthetic culture is just very fascinating and beautiful. This is hard work, as the president likes to say, but it's worth it.

This class is a good and fun class but too ambitious. Essentially, we keep oscillating between literature and art history, which is hard. Plus, most of us have no background in Japanese culture.

Let me just say that Jean is the epitome of the clueless, unpredictable novice instructors you'll meet in Columbia. Try to avoid this class if you can. I'll admit. You don't have to do any reading in this class, and there's no assignments other than the three essays that seem fairly easy. However, Beware! His method of grading is a mystery. You will find an A on your paper that you thought couldn't be any more terrible and vise versa. One thing that's really annoying about this class is that Jean lets discussions go on forever and ever and ever and ever without cutting anybody off. It seems like he's confused at times that he's only there to point out who's the next runner up for the discussion. Jean is a nice guy, but he just doesn't know what he's doing. He mumbles through lectures without clarifying anything. You can tell everyone's frustration when he answers someone's question with the same exact question, hoping someone smart in the class will be able to answer it! Oh, and he doesn't offer extra help during his office hours. I think he thinks that it gives you an advantage over other students.

All i can say is that I'm 99% sure he rigged the results of the survey for Gateway. Who prints out the surveys and gives it out to students to review?? I'm sure he took out all the bad comments about him. How do i know? because my not-so-positive review of Gateway and his teaching was nowhere to be seen!!!!! And he made students read only the comments that praised his 4 pt class and himself! eliminate this class from the engineering core, and i'll happily recommend Columbia Engineering to the seniors back in my highschool.

As previous critics have said, Professor Thurman's class is certainly overrated.  Thurman is an extremely intriguing man who clearly has had an adventurous life, but he doesn't quite fit into the classroom lecture scene.  Most of the class is spent reading aloud many of the elaborately detailed Buddhist texts - it's quite hard to pay attention.  Most of the students appear to be taking the class because Professor Thurman is infact a famous guy (not to mention Uma's father).  People are definitely entertained and Thurman is very entertaining (esp his rants on pop culture and MOVIES...).  The TAs are pretty arrogant - at least when it comes to the mandatory regurgitation in the midterm exam.  Yes you do learn a thing or two about Buddhism but the lack of structure and lucrative discussion leaves you lost in a sea of philosophical confusion.

I wish I had met the Cliff Stein that all the other reviewers keep talking about.  The only thing I agree with is he does seem very annoyed by students.  While he may speak English fluently, he races through the material and does everything differently to the book.  He schedules his office hours early in the morning, so that nobody shows and if you do show, he doesn't really help you much.  The sad part is, you will not get a choice of professors for this class, so you are stuck with him.  Best advice I can give, is start the hw early and use the TAs.

I think the only bad thing I have to say about Achille Varzi is that he gave me a woefully inadequate example of what the other philosophy professors on campus are really like, or philosophy as a whole.  He inspired me to pursue the subject as a major, which in retrospect may have been a mistake, but more the credit to him.  Elementary Logic should be an easy A so long as your homework's kept up with, and though Symbolic Logic is far harder (essentially like an intensive Elem Logic class) I was still able to pull off a C+ throughout a lengthy heroin binge and relying on what I knew from Elem Logic two years prior.

If you can get past the fact that her english isnt spoken very well, the class is okay.  She is really fair when it comes to lightening the workload and the tests were not too bad.  She grades a huge curve.  The first few days you will definitely be confused because of the language barrier, but after a while you start to pick up on a lot of her phrases.

I write with mixed reviews about Professor Young and about her class.  I feel like she really wanted to use this course to arm us with the information that we need to make informed decisions about healthcare as women and possibly as future doctors.  Guys should not feel like they won't find the class interesting; the class is pretty much a public health course with a focus on women and there is a teensy bit of biology.  The texts and the lectures are usually interesting.  Prof. Young has an unusually high tolerance for stupid questions and fails to tell people that asking dumb questions in class does not count as class participation.  The kind of stupidity displayed during class wouldn't have been allowed in my elementary school.  Although lectures were usually cool, the discussion sometimes made class unbearable (girls, listen up: no one wants to hear about your 158  trips to the gynecologist). The midterm actually wasn't hard, but because of nitpicky grading, people did badly even if they obviously had a good understanding of the material.   The homeworks are graded just as harshly.  The TAs are morons and if your answers don't match their answer sheet verbatim,  no points for you.   Overall, the material of the course is interesting, but I find that the grading is unnecessarily nitpicky and makes the homeworks and quizzes more of a bitch than they should be considering how easy they are.

LOL.  Peter Bank isn't that bad at all.  Peter is new this year, so the least you guys could do is finish the class before you bash him.  He is a tiny bit tough to understand sometimes, but he jokes about his accent and will gladly repeat anything.  There are always seats in the front every day (where I sit) - so don't complain about not being able ot understand him if you haven't tried sitting at the front.  It makes a big difference.  He is very funny in class, and he gives tons of examples, and proves everything.  There have been a couple of classes that were tough to follow, but then again I don't read the book before class or do many of the optional assignments, so I doubt they would be tough to follow with a little prep.  9/10 of his classes are easy to follow.  Judging by the grades on the first midterm, most of the people taking Calc IIIA from Bank are terrible at math.  His midterms are harder than I thought they would be, but still not that hard.  Quit whining, everyone.  I have learned a lot in the class.  Our book is great, Peter isn't that bad, and he is more than willing to explain anything you want, just ask.  We have one assignment a week that is somewhat difficult, but only a few problems.  Two midterms, pretty tough, he hasn't said if he would scale them or not.  Haven't gotten to the final yet, so no comment.  There are probably better math teachers out there, but if you are at all talented in math his class isn't even close to the horror story these people are making it out to be.  Don't shy away from him, he's hilarious, nice, and thorough.

Yes, he is a very smart man. Smart enough, mind you, to turn obviously wrong interpretations from students in the seminar into dissertation-quality points about any of the works read in class. He makes everyone feel smart, and teaches the class to appreciate the density and multi-layers of novels marginalized in their own contexts of time. Highly recommend the class (if you're luck to get into the seminar) but I hoped that Dames would've spoken more instead of the over zealous students who had nothing really worthwhile to contribute to class.

I agree with a previous reviewer that Shapiro's lectures are pretty lightweight, which is not a criticism because Shakespeare is thematically quite transparent to begin with. Typically, a Shapiro lecture confirms and nuances your own gut reaction to a play (indeed that's what he solicits in class), putting some of the themes that you have identified in historical and biographical context. His overarching argument is that Shakespeare's take on these themes is more ambivalent than subsequent commentators liked to think. This is a good thing to keep in mind, and after a few lectures you should get the hang of it and start looking at Shakespeare's language with vigilance. Having seen a Shakespeare play realized on stage, I understand how different (and better, in my opinion) that is than reading. So I don't think his acting is a waste of time.
Overall, even though this class may not blow you away with brilliance, this is a good introduction to Shakespeare and more than sufficient for most casual reader's purposes.
I enjoy Shapiro's dynamicism, but most heartening is his passion for the material and for teaching. He loves Shakespeare and theater, and he wants us to love it too. That as a full professor he teaches two undergraduate courses per semester shows his devotion to undergraduates. If he seems ""abrasive"" in class,  that is his way of keeping us alert. If you talk to him during his office hours, you realize he is the kindest professor imaginable. I have a lot of respect of him as a person and as a teacher.

Gottlieb is a very entertaining professor.  As a former speechwriter for Senator Dodd (D-Conn.), Gottlieb brings a knowledge of how Washington really works into the classroom.  He spends at least 10 minutes every class fielding a wide range of questions about current political events, and his time as an insider gives a fresh perspective.  The one pitfall of this is the questions asked by the students in the class.  The questions are often uninformed and not well thought out.  However, this means that Gottlieb, who has a quick wit and a propensity to use it, often responds quickly and in a way that embarrasses the unintelligent questioner.     In terms of the class itself, it is not particularly difficult.  There is a decent amount of reading, but most of it is extremely fascinating.  If you are interested in the history of U.S. foreign policy and how that history informs current viewpoints, then take this class.  Lecture is interesting, but if you are well-informed about international political theory, you will probably find it elementary and, at times, frustrating.  I wonder why it is considered a graduate level class.  My one gripe about the class is the lack of discussion session; the readings are good enough that discussion would be interesting, and it might prevent students from asking dumb questions during lecture.    Generally, if you want an entertaining professor who is not too difficult and offers an interesting perspective, I recommend this class.

Don't be intimidated by his foreign last name and appearence.  He is  an absolutely amazing person who can speak close to perfect English(just a slight accent).  He might go at incredible speeds at times, but if you ask him to slow down and explain something, he'll do it immediately or get back to you later.  He teaches the material well and prepares everyone for the exam.  Sometimes Calc III gets confusing with visualizing all those 3D 4D diagrams, but he is extremely proficient with maple, thus enabling him to plot the graphs on screen and show it to the class.

Although I loved the reading for Lit Hum, Rosenberg made me hate it.  His class ""discussions"" consist of him talking (without saying much) and asking leading questions with obvious answers.  I started off the semester answering a lot of them, and expanding my thoughts, thinking that he wanted to open up discussion, but alas, he just wanted to make sure we read.  His quizzes are an insult to students'  integrity; a good teacher creates an environment in which all students feel free to participate and demonstrate that they have read.   If you cannot create an environment such that you as a teacher can see who has done the reading, you are doing something wrong. Whenever someone in my class made an insightful comment that was out of the order that his sheet of notes prescribed, he would ignore it completely.  This is the worst literature ""seminar - style"" class I have ever taken. The only saving quality is the fact that  is an incredibly  easy grader.

I think the other reviewer was a little harsh on Andrea. Sure, I gotta agree that oftentimes the class discussions were pretty forced, long-winded, and pointless. But then again, at least you didn't need a phd in philosophy to follow the discussions. It's a good class if u want to learn what your peers think of the readings and of different contemporary issues. NOT good to gain major insights into philosophy from a knowledgable teacher. I think his grading is pretty lenient actually. I've done pretty well so far even though I personally didn't think my paper was all that great .

Hm, well I am not at all surprised that people so far either like him or hate him. 
You will hate him if 1. You think you're going to get an A in the class 2. You think you know more about drugs than him 3. You like classes that you don't have to attend the lectures or 4. You hate assclowns (people who like to hear themselves talk during large lecture classes). If any of the 4 describe you, then don't take this course.
This course integrates neuroscience, psychology and sociology in a fascinating way. Yes, you must attend class. Most of the exams are based on his lectures. 
Don't be full of yourself when learning the material though. It's harder then it looks, and his points are subtle, but well thought out. If you go and copy his powerpoints word for word, then you may have a hard time reviewing them because they don't explain every detail - you need to add in stuff he says in class when he explains his powerpoints. So yeah, he expects you to listen to him, and no, its really not that unreasonable. People who think they had to memorize the text didn't go to class and didn't realize that the study guide for each exam pretty much tells you what sections of each chapter you should read. 
Once again, not a science class really, but not a sociology class either. Its just a class about drugs. Many people think he has ulterior motives when teaching - and that's true. But what professor doesn't? I tend to think that because he teaches about drugs, which has a lot of misperceptions and stereotypes that other people have a hard time getting rid of, people tend to get all angry and up in arms about what he suggests or says. He likes it when you question studies or argue with him, even if it pisses off the rest of the class (i personally think it makes the class entertaining and stimulating). He's also funny and engaging. He has the personality of a 20 year old, but he's about 20x as smart.

He explains the political theorists in full, and with their own bias (as if he agreed w/every one of them)... If you're interested in political theory at all, def take this class. As for the exams, it's a pain to memorize 14 essays, and a pain to write them out in such little time. But all you have to do is make a study group, and divide the quotes up, and you'll do fine. I got an A+. I'm shocked at the negative reviews for DD, I really don't understand how this class could be perceived as so terrible. He dislikes George Bush with good reason...and if you're deciding on what classes to take based on the most amount that you can skip, stop wasting your parent's money.

I stepped into his class the first day and found myself understanding 40% of what he was trying to articulate.  I found it hilarious and thus, stayed on.  Bad mistake.  Well firstly i must say that Prof. Bellaiche is REALLY nice.  I mean, he entertains any questions beyond his office hours and tries his very best.  Finding a math prof without an accent seems pretty impossible here in Columbia, so i do think that Prof. Bellaiche is the lesser of the evils amongst the other Cal III profs.  So by all means, take his class.  It is not THAT bad despite the accent.

This woman is like.. the nicest woman you'll ever meet in your entire life!  The class was relatively small (about 8 no more than 10) -- night class (i guess that's why).  Because of the small class size, it makes it easier to understand the work if you're a non-native speaker with no background.  She gives daily quizzes of 10 dictations, in which you will have to write the Chinese characters, but it's not soo bad.  Our class literally kept getting 4/10's, but she gives extra credit work, like e-mailing a penpal over in Taiwan, but you have to e-mail in Chinese, only the characters you know, as long as it's in Chinese, everything is A-OK.  She likes to make jokes, so its makes the class interesting.

Andrea is well-intentioned, interested in the subject matter, occasionally funny and (in my experience) not a harsh grader at all-- but none of those qualities makes up for the fact that he seems like a first-time substitute teacher. Twice a week I sit for two hours boiling with frustration and resentment directed towards most of the class. It's hard to say whether the discussion is nonexistent becase of the apathy and consistent failture to read among the other students, or if that's just a reaction to Andrea's inexperience in leading discussions. Most of the time I feel bad for him, because it's obvious he wishes we would engage with his questions, but it just hasn't been going ANYWHERE and it's almost December. I'm breakin' out.

Shaevitz makes me enjoy going to physics lecture despite my consistently plummeting quiz grades! He has a voice like Kermit the Frog, he makes cute excited sounds when he does demonstrations (every class), and he's pleased to have student input during the lecture.

Balmer is a cool guy -- his lectures aren't particularly fascinating but he really knows what he's talking about.  The reading is somewhat interesting if you choose to do it (no need at all to do it) and he summarizes it in his lectures.  He goes very quickly so you take a lot of notes very fast, but it's well organized.  The paper was graded harshly by the TAs but I didn't spend very much time on it -- I think most others got decently good grades.  The mid-term was very very easy, just read over your notes a few times and you're fine, it's just some multiple choice questions and like 5 IDs.  Very easy.  I recommend this to anyone interested in Civil Rights (it's more Civil Rights than religion) and he shows really good videos like Eyes on the Prize and a movie by Spike Lee.

This class is really inspiring.  It's all about realism vs. idealism, with some theorists in between.  A lot of time is devoted to Plato.  There's a decent amount of reading for the class, which is interesting (The Republic, Antigone, Tao te Ching, The Prince, Hobbes, Aristotle, etc...) but no need to do it.  You just need to go to the lectures and read his outlines carefully before the midterm and final.  He really wants you to memorize his packet (which contains all the outlines).  He goes on tangents on how the theories from Ancient Greece, etc relate to today.  If you're not liberal, it might irritate you but I find it so honest and inspiring.  Good class today if you're looking for something in the middle of Philosophy and Politics.  Also just a really sweet man.

Every psych major ought to be required to take this class.  That being said, it can be fairly hard to get into as Prof. Stroessner is deservedly in high demand.   He is an excellent teacher, challenged both our perceptions of the world and our academic skills.   In retrospect, this class seems easy, but while I was taking it was very time consuming. The time spent was soooo worthwhile, I have learned so much about both theories in psychology and psychological research methods that all of my other psych classes became extremely easy.  The skills I learned in this class allowed me to get a summer research job and a TAship that would otherwise have been out of my league.

This seminar was really tiny, and that was a shame because Prof. Matin is wonderful.  Everything the other reviewers said and more.  Even though I had absolutely no background in the material,  this course ended up being fairly easy because of his patience and understanding.

I still know a little more than i ever wanted to about hearing systems in owls, but I definitely reccommend this course to anyone with any interest in illusions, space perception,  psychology, or anything vaguely related to the topic.

While Janna Levin is funny, interesting, and cool, she is also a very difficult teacher. There are long homeworks with seven questions (usually each question has four to six parts) that a merciless TA grades. There are long involved proofs in class and slightly shorter proofs that she expects you to know for tests. Her tests are also difficult (expect long involved problems with 4-8 parts) and she doesn't budget time very well. Basically she expects students to be dedicated physics lovers and always seems suprised that we can't immediately see the solution to a proof.

Kristen Shepard is a very good professor and makes all the material interesting.  I disagree with the other reviews that claim she answers all questions; I think that's her one flaw, that during class she often receives questions from students with the response, ""ask me after class"" or ""we'll come back to that later.""  I don't care about this but for the students with the questions I'm guessing it is a bit annoying, especially if you don't have time to stay after class.  But this is a very minor fault, and otherwise, this is a good course.

Our class ended up with an average of seven people attending lectures, with less than eighteen there on test days.  Avoid, avoid, avoid.  Reason one for avoidance: his French accent.  Not merely an accent, but sometimes, full out French.  Unless you know that ""eegreck"" means ""y"" and ""squah"" means square, you will not understand him.

Terrible,  just inexcusably terrible. Fellow classmates and I have all confessed to our fear that we might just drop dead from ennui one of these days. He is just so boring . He doesn't lecture, he just summarizes the text at a fifth grade level. After two hours, I can't actually say that we discussed anything. He cannot answer a questions, or simply doesn't care to. 
It actually disgusts me that he has been around for so long and has gotten away with so much. He is a simpering, weak, pathetic misogynist, and if you attempt to discuss sexuality, sex, gender, or anything in any of the texts, he will misunderstand (probably intentionally) your question and avoid answering it or just tell you its irrelevant.

It's really funny, but usually he doesn't indulge pointless conversation because he truly believes in this class (he volunteers to teach it).

Professor Bulliet is humorous, entertaining, and full of historical and facts that probably make him one of the foremost scholars of ""just about everything"" at Columbia.  People showed up regularly because he has got a great personality and repotoire of personal stories that liven up class. However, that being said, this seminar felt like it was all over the place.   I learned a lot about things that I never honestly thought I would ever learn about in a historical context (like the Oxford English Dictionary, Cars in the United States, and Salt), which was cool--but I think that the class would have been better had students been given more focused tasks to do, had discussion remained on topic, and had we had a better idea of what he was looking for on the final paper  (i.e. actual expectations).

Stephanie is so cute and sweet, its hard to not smile every time she says things like ""tac tac tac"" or ""la voiture de Balzac.""  Oops.  She's not a hard grader, as far as language classes go. She started the semester giving us a lot of work every day (readings and grammar exercises) but I think some people mentioned in the midsemester reviews that it was too much, so the workload lightened. She calls on people randomly in class to get everyone to participate, and she loves to discuss and analyze literature, which is her specialty. 
Workload:
Started out quite heavy, but lightened up. Usually a few pages of reading in the literature book, part of a chapter in the grammar book, and 1 or 2 grammar exercises each day. A composition or a quiz each week (standard) and the departmental midterm & final.

Professor Mann is an entertaining and very knowledgeable professor.  He is young, hip and has a nice reparte with the class.  The structure of the class is kind of loose.  We read articles and then have discuss them.  He rarely straight out lectures, which is good for people who find that teaching style boring and not so great for people who want to hammer down the issues and the facts.  He is not a very easy grader on papers but not unfair either.  He takes the class to see a movie and eat Ethiopian food which is cool.  He is approachable for the most part.  The only thing that is a bummer about the class is the longer paper we have to write.  Otherwise I like him and definately take his section over Felicity's.

Prof weisgrau's class is exhaustively uninspiring. Not only are  you  bored, but  you are also frustrated by how much money she makes to stand in front of the class to say absolutely nothing important. I tried day after day to try and appreciate her class.. i really tried. 
Oh, and she also has bad professor etiquette in that she is condescending and has to disagree with, or qualify, everything anyone says in class, ever.  And the sad thing is that whatever she says is either so obvious that it implied, or just plain off topic. 
She also speaks toe slowly, meditates on ideas/words, too long, and after this extended silence,  never says anything profound. 
she;s also an anthropological dinosaur. I feel like shetries really hard to connect with progressive anthropoloigcal (esp cultural anthro)  ideas but you can tell that it doenst entirley resonate with her, excite her, the way that it does other professors.

He begins every class with ""does anybody have any questions?""

I took this class during my first semester at Columbia, with the understanding that it was a ""basic"" math class, and one that would help me if I should want to pursue a math-related major. Whatever this course was designed to be it was hardly basic, and incredibly difficult. One graduating student told me this was the hardest class he had taken throughout his four years at Columbia. This coming from someone who had taken calculus. To be fair, Jeff, as he goes by, seems to think the class is very reasonable. In fact the midterm averages (there are two) were both well below the failing point. The tests seem to be specifically designed to trip you up, and studying turns out to be futile. Jeff used equations combining difficult terms that we had never worked with in such a format, and the entire class came away from each test very upset. In fact, Jeff himself said he was morally dejected after grading the first test. But apparently that didn't help him prepare for the next, which was basically a collection of trick questions designed for a math whiz, not for students taking a basic math class and expected to complete these trick questions in little over an hour. Keep away.
Workload:
Homework assigned each class is due the following week. (often as many as 30 or 40 problems due at a time). Two midterms and a final. Jeff initially intended to mark the homework but that turned out to be too much work for him so as long as you turned it in you were fine.

True, this class is small like the CC and lit hum classes.  However, taking this class is the equivalent of taking a history class, CC, AND lit hum all in the same semester.  For each major eastern Asian civilization, the readings encompass history, philosophy, AND culture.  The philosophy is DEFINITELY NOT a survey: you are expected to really understand Neo-Confucianism, just knowing its definition is not enough.  You learn a lot, but unless you are genuinely interested in the material the class will be a miserable experience.

Professor Hertz is awesome. He will give you an outline of every lecture, and he sticks to it. He is easy to follow and almost never boring. He tells you this on the very first day, but it's important to remember that the hard thing about this course is not the material itself, but the volume (you will have tests on 8 or 12 chapters at once).

To me, this class is like taking East European CC. If you like political theory and you liked CC, then you'll love this class. Great readings, and the course load isn't even that heavy. Abrams is very, very knowledgeable, and it's fascinating to hear about his research in East Central Europe. That said, the weakness of this class is the fact that only one student had previously taken a class on Eastern European history and many of us felt as though we didn't really know the history behind the books we were discussing. I would definitely recommend taking this class if you know the basics of East Central European history, or if you are willing to do some outside reading (which is possible since the class readings aren't that heavy). All in all, very interesting topic, great prof. and reasonable workload. I would also like to add that Abrams is great outside of the class too- very helpful and encouraging, and really cares about his students.

This course changed the direction of my life.  I began the semester as a late-blooming junior, having chosen a major by process of elimination, wholly without career options that aroused my interest.  Professor Skousen conveyed such enthusiasm for economics -- particularly the voluntary exchanges that enhance the lives of millions every day -- that I started to fall in love with ""the dismal science"".  Skousen takes a novel approach to economics, mirrored by the wit and wisdom of his book The Making of Modern Economics.  (Am I the only one who read its unassigned chapters for pleasure?)  Take this class to hear about the lives of pioneering economists, from Marx to Mises, Keynes to Friedman (Skousen brims with enthusiasm and respect for all, strangely enough).  We studied the historical events that shaped these men's perspectives and continue to inform political/Fed decisionmaking.  Oh, a hint: If you prefer Hayek to Krugman, freedom to tyranny, productivity to envy, and reason to ideology, you'll find a kindred spirit in Mark Skousen.

The Applied Physics Seminar is probably the easiest course required for the major, at least at the Junior level.

Good things about Professor Hernandez:
1.  He speaks fluent Castillian Spanish.
2.  He returns tests and papers on time.
3.  He goes through the book at a regular pace.
4.  He tells jokes during the first several weeks.
5.  He is an easy grader.
6.  If you stick with this class, you will eventually have a very small class size as more and more people drop out.  We began with close to twenty students, and ended with about half that number.
Bad things about Professor Hernandez:
1.  He calls on the students with a better grasp of the material more often.  I don't think he does this on purpose.  Rather, he wants the class to move quickly, so he begins to favor those students who keep the class moving quickly.  Unfortunately, this does not help the students who are struggling more with the material.   Several of the slower students dropped out of our class as time went by.
2.  He lacks creativity.  For every class, Professor Hernandez  merely went through the exercises in the book.  Not once did he try to engage the students with something he created himself.
3.  He does not give you much chance to speak in class.  Ideally, language classes should involve a mixture of pairs and small group activities in addition to student-teacher exchange.  Professor Hernandez, however, sticks with student-teacher activities alone.  He used pair activities a handful of times and small group activities never.  This means that during most of the class, you are waiting around for another student to say something.  Perhaps a conversational Spanish class is better in this regard?
4.  He assigns homework, but does not actually check to see if you got it right.  Professor Hernandez checks to see if you did the homework, and then he gives you copies of the answers.  You have a few seconds to ask him questions about the homework before he moves on.  I suppose this works for some people, but I generally would like more feedback on where I could improve my Spanish.
5.  Midway through the term, Professor Hernandez hands out ""anonymous"" evaluation forms, but then publicly berates those students who give him bad marks.  To my mind, this defeats the purpose of anonymous evalutions.
Neutral things about Professor Hernandez:
1.  He picks a grade for you, and that's what you get on most tests.  I did better and worse (sometimes much worse) on my tests, but always receieved the same grade, plus or minus two points.  In my case, this was a ""B"", so I was really happy.  I suppose it depends on what you are shooting for.
2.  Professor Hernandez's personality works for some, and not for others.  He can be abrasive, but I don't think he is as horrible as some people describe him to be.  NYC certainly has people that are a lot worse.
Overall:
For me, taking a Spanish class is about learning Spanish, not about the teacher's personality.  Given the mediocrity of  Professor Hernandez's teaching abilities, and the poor teaching methods he employs, I would recommend taking another class or another language to avoid taking him.  While I am sure that Columbia must have worse language instructors, I certainly hope it has better ones.

I do not mean to praise the man, but Prof. Kitcher has a incredibly clear and logical insight of the texts taught in CC---a wonderful thing when you're trudging through philosophical and political tracts. He will make you understand the texts, unfold their obscurities and show you them in their clarity; you cannot ask for more in a CC class. Being that the time allotted for each text is restricted  and one must apprehend the argument before one can make thoughtful and interesting comments, I really thought that Prof. Kitcher's rather directioned, straight-forward CC classes were more than appropriate. I do not mean to say that his is a class devoid of individual thinking, or of discussion. What I mean to say is that what you get out of CC is clarity of the texts' arguments, rather than jumbled obscurity. He asks us to write two questions concerning the text for every class---though writing them by the middle of the first term truly got tiring. They will, however, force you, at least, to look at the text, which might be good or not. If you do get Prof. Kitcher for CC that means the stars are smiling down on you.

I came to this university in order to avoid classes with professors like this.  Just about everyone who was not required to take this course dropped it and those who didn't deeply regret it.  I have never met a professor so clueless, so overwhelmed, and so out of her league as this one.  The lectures are unstructured and confusing.  During one lecture Professor Ristau actually became so confused that she announced to a flabbergasted classroom that she was glad she didn't have to learn this material because she found it very confusing.  The tests are even worse!  Not only are the questions often not from the material covered by the course (there is therefore no way to study), but the answers are also often wrong, causing much class time to be wasted as the entire class argues their grade.  While she might be a perfectly nice person Professor Ristau has no pity for the students and is unable to help them although she will be more than willing to meet with you.  As unreal as this review may sound it is the truth so do yourself a big favor and DO NOT take this, or any course, with Professor Ristau.

she is horrid. please, if you value the money you spend for your college career, DO NOT take any of her classes.  The reading for this class is so interesting, and dense, but it  class discussions inevitabely lead to Weisgrau's favorite Friends episode.. like when rachel is looking at her sonogram.. Sadly this is where discussions on 300 pages of reading leads to. 
She's just a bad teacher and is socially awkward.  Its okay to talk about friends or even movies in class and to joke about it.. but not when youre not funny, arrogant, and generally difficult to like.  She's socially awkward, and theoreticallly speaking, an anthropological dinosaur. She is uninterested in your paper making a point. RIghtly so, she is fed up with students probelmatizing everything that an anthropologist says. But she does this, i feel, to everyone, no matter how convincing the argument, no matter the student. She just likes to disagree with everything, and to hear herself give recommendations, advisories, etc. Its a bit maternal, very unprofessional.. generally bad professor ettiquette. Shes kinda of the nagging annoyign mother that you're glad you never had.  In essence she likes to hear herself talk.. which is sad because seh never has anything substantioal to say. She is horrid... please, dont take this class.

I also will emphasize that this class is not an easy elective.  Most of the readings, and some of the films, are tedious and pointless unless you really, really like to deconstruct films like a film major.  And there were plenty of film majors in this course.  However, Professor Regan received some unfairly harsh reviews on CULPA.  This is a tough course, and it definitely caters to ""know-it-all"" students.   I found Professor Regan to be a fair grader, and I seriously doubt she ""enjoys"" giving low grades as one reviewer commented.   She's pretty demanding, but for good reason because a 3 1/2 hour class could turn into a free-for-all is she wasn't.  Sure this class is going to lower my GPA, but that's my fault.  I'm not going to blame ""know-it-all"" students and Professor Regan for that.  Fellipe Barbosa was an awesome TA, but he's a pretty demanding grader also.  I'll save my harsh reviews for professors and TA's teaching courses that are part of the Core Curriculum (like a certain Art Hum instructor...)

Professor Stavrou took the sting out of learning how to work with computers.   I recommend this class to anyone that wants to learn how to create web pages or really use Microsoft Excel on a higher level.  He's a fair grader and extremely patient with those of us that are not very computer saavy.  He responds to emails promptly, offers extra credit opportunities, and is generally available to students for extra help.  He will work with advanced students and create more challenging projects for them if the rest of the class is holding them back.

I felt like this class was anti-educational. I took it in a semester when I also took American, European and Ancient courses to fulfill my distribution requirements. I consider myself a somewhat knowledgeable person who has a pretty good grasp of most modern history, so I thought this class would be much more interesting than, say, Roman Social History. But seriously, it was ridiculous. De Grazia does not engage the students at all, and she speaks at about one word per minute, without  substance. She never says ""today we will talk about x, y, z"" - she just  rambles and emphasizes certain euphemisms as if trying to provoke a response transmitting information. Here's an example: she taught us a bit about May 1968 and would say things like ""A student ... REVOLT ... 
took ... PLACE"" then pause for five seconds afterwards as if she said something very profound. Given that there is no textbook, it's not as if we had background knowledge, and I'd prefer she speak more efficiently and actually tell us many more specific details. Sometimes would struggle to search for the right word for a while which was surreal for the students sitting there as she talked to herself. I can see how she might be better in a more intimate setting, but attending her lecture in the IAB building was like attending a non-class. People fell asleep and played computer games  without consequences. I understand that an intelligent person with lots of great stuff to say should be accorded  a good amount of respect, but I don't think she did a good job taking into consideration what it was like to be her student. She didn't prepare materials in a way that allowed students  to understand what she expected of you. The readings and lectures were underwhelming, which made the grading on the midterms a total surprise and writing the papers unenjoyable. One of the essay questions asked something like ""Talk about the consumer culture after World War II and how it affected social ties, say, gender relations."" It literally used the word ""say"" as the transition. When I got my paper back, I got comments that said that I didn't make enough of a big deal out of gender in my thesis. What is most upsetting is that if the essays weren't phrased so vaguely then I could've written a more precise paper. I feel like students were punished for not guessing what the professors wanted. Ultimately, I feel like this class was more efficiently learned and studied if you just stayed home and read the class readings instead of attended lectures for 3 hours/week.

WARNING this is the worst professor you will ever encounter. Not only do his lectures go off on tangents but his test have nothing to do with his practice test. If you want to do well in this class, just hope that your a good guesser on test. If you are stuck with this guy i warn you to find A WAY to SWITCH classes because the other chemistry professors such as turro give very easy exams. However, what makes professor Fine a complete jerk is the fact that he will talk about dumb things in lecture that do not pertain to chemistry... and he is not funny... simply an old man who you want to kill!

The other review shows everything wrong with taking this site too seriously--on a culpa review, either the teacher is horrible or life-changing. After all, why would you waste time here if you're not a. pissed or b. ecstatic.  Hopefully I can add something that's not too slanted towards the typical overly critical columbia cynic.
With what I've heard from other students and after having a light weight lit hum professor, Terrier seems like a solid teacher. Sure, he scared some people off at the beginning with an overly structured, boring and dry lecture, but things changed. Terrier impresses me with his ability to change things up when they're not working.  His modesty, non-judgemental attitude, knowledge of political science and philosophy (his major), and interesting questions are also impressive. CC can have boring readings and no one should expect a course with readings like city of god and aristotle (douchebag extraordinaire) to be a day at the amusement park, but we do fit in a couple of pretty interesting conversations. If there is any failure in the class, it can be blamed on the students, half apathetic, half pedantic and half dumb. 
A few criticisms on Jean. I think he's gotten a little lazier as the semester's progressed. We have student presentations now and he sits on the side the whole time completely silent. Should we be doing the same when he lectures?
The midterm was also pretty non-traditional. Easy and enlightening open book and note type deal. Also a matrix to fill in, cause Jean loves his matrices. That's matrices, not matrixes, Jean. To whoever was worried about their grade on it, you're getting a little too jaded by grade inflation. 
Jean Terrier's informative, dense, and relatively fast paced lectures are refreshing after my fluffy teacher last year, who took us on a time travel journey back to middle school english class (not a time I'd particularly like to revisit.)

In all of my other reviews, I make a conscious effort to give a balanced review, since most profs have their good points and bad points.  KUFLIK IS PERHAPS THE WORST PROFESSOR I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED.  Bioethics should be a fascinating course, but he absolutely ruined it.  The texts we read were interested, and I was encouraged when I walked into the first class and saw we'd be sitting around a big table.  But instead, Kuflik took up the entire time rambling and basically doing nothing but recapping what we read--but taking 3 hours to do it.  If someone had an opinion that was slightly different from his, he would barely entertain it, and sometimes blatantly shoot it down.  His lectures were unorganized and boring and brought little or nothing to the texts we read.  If you want to learn about Bioethics, buy the textbook, and read it on your own, but DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.

I am not an econ major, so this review may be skewed. However, I found this class challenging enough to take it pass/fail. Some may find the class laughably easy, but without any real world experience in the subject matter, the concepts can be really confusing and meaningless. The class is also 2 hours long, but Jay let us out a half hour early. Jay is a young, funny, nice guy with lots of helpful advice, but alas, he is not a good lecturer. He just never explained anything in a way that I could understand- even really simple stuff. Of course, not having a clear explanation of anything made the class that much harder.

In-class discussions are engaging, and Bollinger keeps the bullshitters quiet, and challenges everyone else to think harder. He takes a casual approach, which makes for a comfortable atmosphere, but if you're looking for a class where you'll find all the answers neatly spelled out on the blackboard, this class isn't it.

Carl Hart is one of Columbia's hidden gems. I don't know where to begin praising him...he's an incredibly intelligent, articulate professor who peels away all the BS associated with drugs, giving you (no pun intended) the straight dope. It's science, history, and sociology in one class. You'll learn about how some drugs (and drug users) have been unfairly demonized by the government in particular. He works at the NY State Psychiatric Institute, so he knows all of this from first-hand experience. Yes, the tests can be deceptively hard, but don't worry about the pop quizzes because most of them were open-note anyway.
Furthermore, Professor Hart is just a genuinely nice person. He makes himself very available outside class, and will discuss just about anything with you. He tolerates all sorts of questions in class, and while sometimes that may be annoying if the students just want to hear themselves talk, it's great to know that he cares enough to hear students' concerns and straighten out their misconceptions. This is a great class to take to fulfill your CC science requirement. Maybe not an easy A, but you'll learn loads. Even at 9 AM, he had the ability to hold my attention. I wish I had professors like him in every class...I would learn a whole lot more than I currently am.

After my first class with Dan Miron I wanted to drop the course. But  not so fast ... 
despite my first impulse I stayed and discovered what a great professor he is. He is a really good lecturer, you'll want to go to every lecture, partly because he's interesting and partly because the really important stuff will come out of Miron's mouth in lectures not from the readinsg which are mostly short stories and texts by various zionist thinkers, most of which are pretty impossible to understand without going to lectures. Personality wise he's your typical old Israeli guy,  super gruff and pretty intimidating (and I'm not one to be easily intimidated), highly intelligent and with a dry sense of humor underneath it all. 
What really makes him a great professor is this:
He takes time trying to understand what you want to say in your paper, and will help you develop your argument if you plan ahead enough to give him the time to read a draft. I wrote a draft that I think he might have hated and/ or disagreed with, but he gave really constructive critiizism, pointed me to the right books, and the end product was what I consider to be the best paper I've ever written.

Being a non major in science, I have found this class an uphill task and a complete misery. There is a fair smattering of math involved (even though we are told that we dont need to worry about the details) and Prof Melnick rarely works through the derivations with us. The lectures are coherent, fairly clear although I get the distinct impression that asking questions in class is not encouraged jusding by Prof Melnicks brusque manner when one is asked. I have found the recitation sessions with my TA to be more helpful than the class. She is willing to spend as much time as required to help me go over the concepts. I would fail the course despite having done the readings, attended all the classes, if it had not been for my TA and her help in understanding the concepts. Even though this is meant to be a class for non science majors, I wouldnt advocate this classs.

Other reviewers have been unjustly harsh on Professor Evans.  He is surely not the most scintillating professor I have ever had, and his lectures include a lot of math for what is billed as a non-math course, but he genuinely tries to teach.  His lectures are well-organized and he gives every question from students a great deal of respect.  If you have taken physics before or know a lot about it, of course you will be bored, but that is the price of being lazy and retaking a subject just to get an A.

Jamil is certainly an odd bird, as professors go.  He adopts a very strict persona to teach class, but breaks out of it every so often to make jokes, whose hilarity is what keeps me coming back.  He is a good, engaging teacher who makes sure that everyone participates, and therefore everyone has a chance to screw the language up at some point.  Our class always included a ""conversational"" period at the end, which allowed people in the class to get to know each other and we all felt very comfortable by the end of the semester.

I'm not surprised by the negative feedback for Professor Nacos--  as the time slot for this class (6-8) may have contributed to the dwindling attendance.  As other students have pointed out, her midterm and final are based almost exclusively on her lectures; you may think of the assigned readings as secondary  material.  She makes this very clear from the first day of class, and reminds the class throughout the semester.  She prepares outlines for each lecture, and follows them extremely closely.  She speaks from experience, and includes relevant and timely examples.  I suspect that the more negative reviews are from students who did not attend class regularly.
I'll admit that at first Professor Nacos' accent took some getting used to-- go to class, it gets easier to understand.

I'm suprised at the polar opposite views expressed about ""Dan.""  I was under the impression that the majority of students held the same kind of apathy that Dan himself seems to exude.  I guess I'm more confused by him than anything else.  Yes, he gets distracted easily, and the ""know-it-all"" students ask questions that eat up class time seemingly for the sole reason to discredit him and make him say, ""I'm just a dumb guy.""  Which he says quite often.  Yes, his lectures are incredibly boring, and while he does use examples as another reviewer mentioned, in the class that I took they mostly concerned squirrels, his cat, or the homeless on the subways.  He has a bizzarre sense of ""humor""-- I don't think of it as humor as much as maybe a social disorder.  It is entertaining, in a kind of disturbing way.
I will say that the lectures got increasingly better as the semester went on.  It seems that he just takes awhile to get going, spins his wheels for the first couple of weeks.  He really knows his stuff, and does seem to be a genuinely caring educator-- but his ability to teach seems hindered by his quirky social ineptitude.

Dan's response to student's questions about grading?  There is a long and complicated log in the syllabus, or as he puts it, ""What you do really good on will be counted positively toward your grade, and what you do bad on, not so much...don't worry it's standard econ-elective distribution...""

I don't know if the past reviewer and I had a completely different professor because I'd have to disagree on quite a few points on his/her review. Firstly, the class is usually 90% Carlos speaking. Obviously this is great if you like to get the interesting points and connections of the books fed to you, but I personally don't like being lectured to. There is thus very little room for students to put in their own ideas and start new topics (unless they happen to align with what Carlos himself wanted to talk about). Secondly, Carlos tends to display body language that does in fact put students down when he feels their input/ideas are wrong/not parallel to his own. He'll say (albeit politely) that that wasn't exactly what he was looking for or say a prolonged ""ooookk..."" and move on to where he wanted to go originally. Carlos also is provocative in his language and while some find it amusing and refreshing there may be others out there who find it less than appropriate. He IS however, very much available for help outside of class and tries to lend you his advice as much as possible--but you should know beforehand that if he found your plight amusing he'll use the story as a joke for his classes.

Calculus is an extremely difficult subject matter to grasp and the fact that the math department at columbia is disastrous at best did not help matters much.  My saving grace in Calc I was having Julius Ross as my professor.  He was always willing to offer his assistance outside of the classroom.  After class, he was quite patient and meticulous in explaining that peculiar point in the lecture you didn't quite understand.  Regardless of when his office hours were, you could easily walk into his office and ask for him to clarify that elusive homework or webwork problem, and he would drop whatever he was doing to come to your rescue.  Several times, I have been in his office on the verge of an epiphany when another professor would walk in and ask him if he was ready to head to launch, and he would politely ask for a moment, as he continued to walk me through the process.  So it comes as no suprise that I told any and everybody who was preparing to embark on that tortorous journey nicknamed calculus, if you are determined to put yourself through hell, you must have an angel like Julius Ross at your side.  If ever I find myself forced to endure another semester of calculus I would only do so with Ross as my Professor.  I was almost tempted to take calculus again despite my hellish experience, just to have Julius Ross as my professor for another semester. Calculus was one of my least favorite courses this semester, but Julius Ross was my favorite Professor this semester and I was willing and able to wake up at 8am every morning for calculus solely because of him.  He is a fantastic teacher and a spectecular human being and though he is a new professor he will be the gem of the math department, matter of fact he already is.
Workload:
One homework assignment per week which looks short and sweet until you begin them: they truly takes several hours as in 6-8 hours.  Then one webworks per week (also take several hours unless you're smart enough to go to his office hours and have him help you step by step through several problems same goes for the homework and avoid the math help generally too crowded to be useful). 2 midterms and 1 final both of which are not impossible difficult, study for them and you should be able to meet the curve and get a B.  the first midterm the curve was 58 out of 98 was a B and the second one 63 out of 100 if I remember correctly, anyway a D becomes a B) this 2 midterms account for 40% of your grade, the final (which I haven't taken) is 40% of your grade and the homework/webworks are 20% (he curves this section as well).  After he's curved all 3 sections, if the class average is not the B he desires, he'll go back and adjust the boundaries of his curve.  so, work hard, study, take advantage of his office hours and doing homework/webworks in groups (key to success) and you're guaranteed at least a B if not a B+ or  A-.

i highly recommend this class if this is an area that youd be interested in. the lectures can be a little dry, but the subject matter is interesting, and rafaeli does make efforts to engage the class in discussion and bring the issues to life. however, this means that you will basically never get through the slides in class. rafaeli will just say ""you can read them yourselves,"" and you best be sure you do.. because the most minute details will end up on the exams. however, rafaeli makes himself readily available, and really wants to help you understand the material better. you cant help but feel for him when he gets nervous speaking... and hes really knowledgable in his field, and it really shows in the discussions. i really enjoyed the class.

Madeline is definitely a character but she does know what she's talking about though sometimes there's a bit of a communication gap between her trying to convey what she wants to see and what we think she wants.

She's not malicious and though sometimes she may seem abrupt, she really is just trying to get students to get over themselves and what limitations they think they have.  She's supportive and helpful in critiques if you can manage to put forth the effort.  There is an insane amount of work for this class but it's only as crazy as you let it get.

Susser was an absolute joy.  In a great mood every day, enthusiastic about the matierial, hilarious... I don't know what else to say.  His passion for music shines through and is infectious.  The story of how I came to take his class is slightly interesting.  I was in a physics class that I hated, but I couldn't drop it without picking up another class.  It wasn't past the drop deadline, but it was past the add deadline, so I had to get a form and all of that.  I was so nervous when I went to ask Professor Susser if I could join his class because I knew I would be stuck in physics for a year if he refused.  I went up to him to ask if I could join, and I said ""Are you Professor Susser?""  He must've seen my ""Drop/Add form"" and before I could get out another word, he said ""Be a dear and hold my coffee for me, and just so you know, the answer is 'yes.'""  I couldn't stop laughing as he joked while we filled out the form, and I'm sure my overwhelming joy at being added to the class was obvious.  This class along with lit hum has been my favorite of the semester, and I plan to take more classes in music because I had so much fun in this class.  I always left Professor Susser's class in a great mood, and I would recommend his class to anyone if you want to learn a lot about music theory (some describe the class as intense, I thought it was fine) and have a great time.
The best Susser quotes:
""I'm sorry, I just didn't hear you - no I think you said the right answer, I just couldn't hear you""
Susser: ""Someone give me a key, anybody"" voice from the class: ""F#"" Susser: Evil look

My first impression of the course was that it would be very difficult but once I got used to his testing methods Calc became resonable and fun almost.  I actually enjoyed going to class, and you might even say I looked forward to it.  YES! Alex has the best personality and can actually teach.

Professor Vogt was great.  She is very kind, quiet, and at times awkward but pleasant and high-spirited.  She warms up to the class as the semester moves on.

She is a fair grader and not very harsh.  She is a pretty good lecturer but sometimes it can drag a little if the class hasn't done the reading, and a lot of the time you really don't have to do the reading.

Len is very very boring and you will do just fine not going to the lectures.  He spends more time going over the nobel prize winners that studied at CU than actually teaching Chem.  Anything worthwhile in the lectures he goes over too fast for you to understand. He seems like a very intelligent man and he is very very nice but because of this course i am dropping pre-med for now.  The practice exams have nothing to do with the actual exams.  And from what i hear the other teachers are 10 times easier but Fine writes the Final so at least youll have a good idea what that will be like.  Basically if you want to learn anything then stick to your textbook.  One good point is that he will always try to give you the highest grade possible- for example we had a 25 question test where 5 of the questions didn't count but if you got all 5 questions right then he gave you the higher percentage grade.

This man might appear a bit cocky at first sight, but he is the nicest person ever and knows his stuff very well..  I never took econ in my life and now I'm in love with econ, partially because of my family, but a huge part has to do with Gulati.  His lectures are interesting and interactive, some stuff might be a bit boring and sleep-inducing, but for the most part, he tries hard and makes sure everyone's awake(sometimes with flying chalk).  Sure his midterm is a little picky, but if you studied the book well, you can't do that bad; I got a A- on that.  However, even if I got a not so good grade on the midterm, I will still not regret taking Gulati's class.  He's a small man that speaks volumes.  He has been to many places and knows a lot about economics and the world.  His last lecture about income distrubution exemplifies his benevolence and his charisma...

I have never written a CULPA review but this class is so inspirational that I felt moved to do so. Seriously, Professor Kiaer is amazing. She is an incredibly engaging lecturer, and is quite brilliant. The structure of the class is kind of unique for an art history class-- we studied the history of the feminist movement as well as developments in the art world during the period, and the readings were mostly theory.  I learned so much it's obscene. I never wanted to miss a lecture. I don't think she will offer this again until fall 2006, but if you're a first-
year or sophomore, TAKE IT.  I became an art history concentrator largely because of this class. Best I've ever taken here, by far.

So I read over the other reviews, and I have to say that I have no idea what the others are talking about, but then maybe it's because the class is different.  In CST, Prof. Eyal was thought provoking and fun.  His accent shouldn't present a problem if you've done the reading.  Every lecture was interesting, the readings only seemed to supplement his lectures, he made jokes that were actually funny, he answered questions fully and always made a point to go back to you if you raised your hand while he was on a roll, and the list goes on.  I say that if it's between reading the book and going to lecture, go to lecture.  His exams really require your having been in class.  It's hard to make Durkheim interesting without watering him down.  Prof. Eyal manages to do it, with an outlined lecture and never goes over class time.

I tried to attend most of the class, hoping that at least the class notes will me to understand the material.  Unfortunately, I was totally WRONG!  He not only puts you to sleep in class, his problem sets are so long and difficult that you just want to stare at it and cry.  
He always tries to ""challenge"" the students by teaching the most complicated and unnecessary stuff.  When I showed my TAs, they said that's what they are learning in grad school! ...

Prof Sacks is, in a word, incredible.  What makes him so remarkable is that he treats us like adults rather than students - he knows that half of us don't do the readings, he lets you hand in papers up to a week late, and he gives much less work than other Lit Hum teachers.  And, since he gets so excited about the discussions, we always end up falling a few classes behind on the readings, so the reading load becomes relatively light compared to other sections.
Also, he really knows his stuff.  He has The Iliad memorized in both Greek and English, and he's very familiar with the other texts as well. BUT, his classes are not boring lectures of his own ideas.  On the contrary, he often remarks that we likely couldn't care less about what he refers to as his ridiculous and crazy thoughts.  Instead, he really wants to hear what we have to say.  The class dynamics therefore turns into a discussion in which he joins us in pondering issues in the texts.  And you know that he really listens to what students say because he almost always asks follow-up questions - which seeems like it would suck if you're trying to BS an answer, but it's rare that you're forced to do so in his class because you'll find that his questions usually provoke you to actually think.  And his follow-up questions are not meant to test you, but to make sure that he really understands your comment.
Prof Sacks is truly there for his students.  If you need help with a paper, go to his office hours and he'll flood you with ideas.  If you need an extension, just ask.  He is perhaps a bit eccentric, but what professor isn't?  Taking Lit Hum with Prof Sacks is really really worthwhile - and you know that he feels that his time spent teaching you is worthwhile as well.

Professor Stanislawski has an amazing breadth _and_ depth of knowledge on all things Jewish History.  Despite the occasional (usually interesting) tangent, his lectures are some of the more organized I've encountered in the History department, and usually balance information and entertainment just enough to keep your interest.  
That said, there are certain situations where he is at his best.  The History of Israel lecture is too big and too tense for him to do a good job - he often rebuffs student questions that he finds too controversial and avoids entire topics to prevent arguments.  He makes no effort to get to know anyone (even those who come speak to him after class multiple times) and seems to want to run in, teach, and run out, not to be seen again until his next scheduled lecture.  However, in the (much) smaller Eastern European Jewish History lecture, he's in his element.  He claims to want to get to know every student and encourages questions and discussions (and here is where everyone could use a little less of the life long learners who have fascinating things to add but try to take over the class).  The class is surprisingly comprehensive for covering such a long period, and his lectures are usually very interesting and dynamic.  On the other had, don't think that just because he says he wants to get to know you he really does.  While a few people have found his office hours helpful, my experiences and those of people I know have been very negative.  His helpful comments soon turn to degrading a question as stupid or self-evident, what he perceives as ""pep talks"" can be condescending, useless, and obnoxious at best.  For a good office hours interaction, best bet is to ask him to talk about himself or his own work, and leave yourself out of it.

Jon is the best TA I've ever had.  Hes intelligent, insightful, and creative when it comes to leading recitation and putting out ideas.  He can lucidly explain even the most obscure of Taussig's ideas and he puts thought and care into commenting on papers.  He is very generous with deadlines and extensions, and would rather you turn in a good paper a few days late than a crappy one on the day its due.  You can tell he really cares about his students and wants us to do well and understand the texts and ideas put forth in class.  I have absolutely no complaints about Jon: recitation was always fun and interesting, very informal and ran more like a group discussion than a teaching session, yet it was nevertheless always very helpful.

Eventhough he's already gotten some 20 or so rave reviews on CULPA, I had to share my love for this man!! As a pre-med, I had a pretty dreary course load first semester of sophomore year, and I thank my lucky stars that I had at least this class to grant me a much need break.  Without fail, going to French would cheer me up and put me in a good mood for the rest of the day because Vincent is hilarious, incredibly kind, and amazingly intelligent. The thought of not having French with Aurora next semester makes me want to cry. If you're lucky enough to get in his class, be thankful, be very thankful. And, a side note, some of these reviews mentioned Vincent's inappropriateness. Um, I have no idea what they're talking about. He's zany and off the wall and makes a huge mess with his chalk, but he's an incredible teacher. He loves what he does and he makes that clear everytime you walk into his classroom.

This person simply doesn't know how to teach. Most of the classes were reduced to mediocre student presentations to compensate for the instructor's lack of competence in both her expertise in the field and her English language ability. When she did lecture a bit, she would resort to cliched notions of Zen, tea ceremony, and the misty pagodas that represented Japanese architecture to the orientalists of the prewar period.

Don't be decieved by Holme's engaging lectures. He is NOT a nice person. Granted, the class is really interesting, but Holmes' emphasis on the importance of participation lulls unsuspecting students into the mistake of actually participating. Those who participated on a regular basis actually got LOWER grades than those who said nothing, I'm guessing because he only noticed when the opinionated people had a quiet day. 
On the other hand, I loved this class up until the arbitrary grades showed up (and you get NO feedback until grades are posted).  So if you want to, or have to, take this class, put extra effort into the writing assignments and be careful not to speak while attending every class: there are no excused absences (holmes won't tell you this up front).

He's a nice guy, and sometimes makes funny references.  That's about the only good thing I can say about him.  He missed a bunch of classes... once he didn't give us any warning, once he e-mailed us cancelling after 1am.  While that may not be a big deal if the class wasn't at 9am, it was a pain when you'd wake up early (esp if you didn't check your email late at night) for class only to find out it was cancelled.  As a result, the syllabus got very messed up and he never made amends to it as he promised.  He usually came in late and somewhat unprepared.  I felt like I learned nothing in the class, and he was pretty merciless when he came to telling us what we needed to know for the midterm.  In addition, he basically gave us his Spring 2002 midterm, when the class was 2 hours long, not 1:15 and we ran out of time when it came to the essay section.  He also repeatedly walked out during the midterm which was really unhelpful.  Maybe he was good a few years ago, but he clearly did not have the time & didn't make the effort for our class, and it really screwed over our section.

    I second the review directly previous; this class is absolutely unequivocally terrible. I've never written a CULPA review before now, but I feel it'd be irresponsible not to after having taken this class. F**KING AWFUL. God how I loathe it with the fire of ten hundred thousand suns. .no, it really is that bad. A black hole of pedagogical suck, Bower is unfocused, indifferent, and rude, and yes--his lame attempts at wit really really grate. I'm so glad to know someone else actually finds him unfunny. 'Depressing beast,' as another reviewer described him, is just about perfect. His lecturing 'style' is disorganized and unproductive; his free-associative lectures feel more like an excuse to avoid preparing something to deliver to the class than 'threads' as he so artfully calls them. Instead of teaching, he serves up either a totally redundant rehearsal of the readings which adds nothing new to your understanding of them (not that there's much to get to begin with) or rattles off a bunch of vaguely related material in a manner which makes it all seem somehow even more totally irrelevant, with some anecdotes and fucking terrible jokes tossed in for piquancy . . The course requirements are as muddled as his lectures. I was delighted to learn two weeks before the end of the semester that the 'Hudson River Report' due at the last class was to be 25 pages long. .which is just a little outrageous for an intro class like this one--and he's been pretty cagey, when it comes down to it, about what exactly is supposed to be included in it. And then of course, there are all the annoying little quizzes and weekly tests that you can't make up without a pink slip from your dean, and the labs--one of which involved walking down to a playground and listening to our lab instructor read us a CHILDREN'S BOOK about a lighthouse. Oh no, I'm not kidding. Yeah the labs are pointless too. .reconstructing vole skeletons is pretty cool though. .and to her credit Diane is a really great lab instructor who did her best to represent on the students' behalf and whatnot, but evidently in vain since Bower doesn't seem to care about or listen to anyone but his own well-distended ego. . .but yeah, this class, if you dare take it, will just confound you with its shittiness, so don't do it unless you have to (god forbid). Really, it boggles the mind. Total waste of time and money, and totally inexcusable, really, as an offering at any accredited institution--and Bower is definitely the weak link here. The material is interesting, sure, but he kills it dead. HATE.

What a class. A comprehensive overview of Japanese history, civilization and culture until the mid 1900s, the class was never short of fascinating, the readings always engaging, and the lectures incredible. Professor Pflugfelder's vast wealth of knowledge and particular interests -- specifically gendered spaces throughout the different periods of Japanese history -- were the core of a broader narrative that was at once easy and a pleasure to follow. This course was never just a requirement-filler, but I consider myself lucky to have had Plugfelder as the professor.

Prof. Gold has taught the summer version of James Joyce twice. I am not sure if he will teach it again, but I would hesitate to take this course. Prof. Gold's lectures were passable but not great until Ulysses, where he fell ridiculously behind schedule and often seemed unable to present coherent ideas, identifying small themes here and there. He barely covered chapter 6 in the second last class, but assigned our last paper on chapter 11 and our final on 12 in order to force us to get to the ending. How he could do that in good conscience continues to puzzle me to this day.
Joyce is difficult to read, even more so to teach, and syllabus was basically impossibly ambitious given the compressed summer schedule. But Prof. Gold made things worse by requiring a presentation from each student. While some of the presentations were good, none (mine included) were worth the precious class time. The research assignment--summary of an academic paper on Ulysses and two evaluations of it--was supposed to help our papers but was completely useless.
Prof. Gold appears somewhat abrasive, but is at base a nice guy who is always ready to help. He clearly loves Joyce and knows a lot about him, although his presentation was not always lucid. I do think his course could have been a good experience--and it was not terrible--if he did away with the frivolities and focused on delivering good lectures.

There is a lot of reading and some of it can be a little dry but Ms. Palmer trys to make it as interesting as she can.  This is really a pretty easy course at columbia.  Much of the class is summarizing the readings so if you do at least part of the reading for the class you should have something to contribute.  I would suggest this course for a major cultures class and anyone at all interested in Africa.  There is also a weekly visual hour where we watched movies or heard lectures.

Frankly, I don't understand the hype. Issues of political bias aside, Massad simply wasn't a very good professor. His lecturing was scattershot and rambling, especially compared to Janaki Bakhle, who taught the first half of the class. For example, our lecture about (ostentiably) Saudi Arabia was around 20 minutes of discussion as to whether or not the author of our assigned reading was an Orientalist (a term you'll grow thoroughly sick of during the course)  and a good 45 minutes of ranting about Israel. He was perfectly courteous to me when I approached him after class with some questions that could be interpreted as an attack, which I appreciate greatly. However, that can't make up for the unfocused, rambling lectures and the bizarre nature of the readings. Can you imagine a class on abortion where the only assigned reading was Planned Parenthood pamphlets? Well, Professor Massad's only assigned reading on Zionism/Israel was the classic anti-Zionist work ""Israel: A Colonial Settler State?"" by Maxime Rodinson. The class started with the birth of Islam as if all of the important events that took place in the MIddle East--the rise and fall of the Persian Empire, the birth of Judaism, the birth of Christianity--hell, the birth of civilisation! paled in significance before Islam.  All in all, Professor Massad seems to be the darling of the Middle Eastern professors around the country, but I simply don't understand. Maybe if I take some of his other courses I'll see what the big deal is, but this intro course, in my opinion, was merely a disorganized, wavering series of rambles from a mediocre academic.

Shany is without a doubt one of THE WORST teachers I have ever had. He must be on some sort of power trip, because he really enjoys hearing himself talk. He interrupts students all the time and wouldn't let us discuss what was interesting or confusing, only the material he thought was necessary. He's actually annoying more than anything and is quite possibly the most anal person I have ever met. Don't come late to class. Don't ever let your cell phone go off. NEVER bring food to class. Oh and make sure you sit in the group circle. Last but not least, if you're unfortunate enough to get stuck in his section, be sure to talk a lot. 
It doesn't matter what you say, honestly, because half the time people were either spewing verbal diarrhea and getting credit for it, or they were being interrupted in the middle of a sentence. I came out of Shany's section more confused and pissed than when I went in. I was planning on maybe majoring in Poli Sci, but after going through the torture of Shany's boring and immensely irritating section, I'm having second thoughts.

I completely agree with the review above. I went to a public high school in a not-so-great neighborhood and even there  never encountered such an instructor. Not only does she clearly have no idea what she's talking about (as several times the slides she posted were wrong and needed to be redone) but in my opinion she is irrational, and completely unwilling to compromise. Her exams are ridiculous as oftentimes the answer would contradict what the text said or her own notes. For example, she gave us an equation in class (not in the book) and tested us on it having forgotten to mention to the class that a proportion needs to be used in the equation. She often forgets THE MOST IMPORTANT part of an experiment or any given theory. Also, the last test was clearly not measure for time: the entire class ended up staying a half an hour later and her instructions were insanely unclear (she didn't even show up to class on the exam date). When I met with her she hurried me out after five minutes (after having me wait for ten) saying she needed to meet with another student. Going to class is an utter waste to time since her lectures and notes don't make any sene. Also, we wasted entire classes arguing with her about how she marked correct answers incorrect to no avail. She's awful. Avoid Ristau at all costs.

I highly recommend this class as long as your happiness isn't measured in A's.  Class discussion often borders on brilliant insanity, both because of its intelligent students and a deeply knowledgeable and passionate teacher.  He is also extremely friendly and approachable, and while he admits not to speak in ""English idiomatic language"" his Italian accent is far from unintelligible.  Judging from the L + R reviews, people hated him for his grading.  It is true, he's a ridiculously harsh and meticulous grader on his essays.  I wouldn't call him arbitrary, as you will receive both of your papers back fraught with comments.  Just be glad he doesn't use a red pen.

I consider Laveen Naidu one of the best teachers at Columbia.  He gave all of his students tough love, and paid attention to everyone's weaknesses and improvements.  Most importantly, he really understands how to convey the ideas that he wants dancers to understand.  This comes as a refreshing contrast with the many dance teachers who struggle with explaining how to do things that they never found difficult.  Prof. Naidu started at Columbia this fall, and he might not return.  If he doesn't, we will all miss him!

It will probably fill even more next semester as the department will offer no Ballet VI classes.  You need tremendous focus to take this class, or you need need to come with goals of giggling with good girlfriends and enjoying yourself.  Arrive early to claim a spot at the barre.

One word: frustration. If you can get survive Prof. Schmidt's unreliablility, sloppiness, and overall obliviousness, you can survive the class. While the readings are easy, Prof. Schmidt can't lead a discussion and relies on the class to research the background of the author in order to somehow stimulate discussion.

Everyone in my class agreed that Katja Vogt was an amazing professor.  The more that you put into her class, the more that you get out of it.  If you are a student only motivated by the fear of doing poorly, then she is not the teacher for you as she grades very easily and you should have no problem getting an A- if you do the reading.  Many students are receiving A's and none are getting below a B (even those that don't read).  The more that I got into the books, the better of a professor she seemed to be.  Her class is all about group discussions which she actively leads, but always chooses to defer to a student even mid sentence.  If a student nails a question, she gets very excited and never tells a student that he/she is wrong.  Sometimes she says, ""Well, I've never heard that before, but let's see what (place name here) thinks about it.""  It is an amazing class.  There can not be a better lit hum teacher.

Jeff is by far the best University Writing professor out there.  He is a really fun, funny, entertaining guy.  He recognizes that it is an aweful class and that teaching how to write is impossible, and then proceeds in making the course as painless as possible.  He does not follow the trend of grading really hard early on in the semester and then giving inflated grades later so he can pat himself on the back.  Instead, he is a fair grader throughout giving all A's and B's.  He changes the prompts to make them more interesting than any other teacher's, and he limits the amount of busy work.

Van Gorkom has the most difficult accent to comprehend.  However, on top of the fact that she comes from an isolated cave in the underwater world of the Netherlands, she likes to talk to one side of the classroom (I don't know which is better: having her to talk to you or not having to listen to her).  Van Gorkom is not helpful when it comes to understanding course material and expects her students to know all of the answers coming in.  If you don't know an answer, be afraid, because she will shut you down and think you're stupid.  Oh yeah, and this class should be 20 points because it feels like you're there for the entire day., so bring a bag lunch and a pillow.
The course sucks enough as it is and having Van Gorkom just adds to the suckiness.  The only good quality I can give Van Gorkom is that she does make herself very available to help her students on the problem sets, however, she grades them ridiculously hard.

I was a bit skeptical of the professor at first.  He uses an historical approach to economics, beginning with the conception of money and working forward.  By the midterm I had a feeling that we would never get past WWII.  I was wrong on this account; we covered material all the way up to modern day.  It was until late in the semester that I realized how effective a method he had for teaching a class.  I feel my ability to analyze current policy is strengthend by this historical approach.
As a professor, Skousen is a wonderful guy.  He is a free-market libertarian (probably the only one at Columbia), but he presents all sides of economic theory fairly.  And while its clear that he prefers the latter, he gives enough information in class for students to defend either economist.  Skousen has worked in the financial sector (and is still an investment advisor) so he earns more credibility because he draw from real-world experience.
The Aplia assignments are frustrating and a waste of time.  One was due each week, but some students finished them all in the first week.  True these people might be overachievers, but it shows that little of the information on the tests is learned from Aplia.  Simply put, if you already know something about Money and Banking, the Aplia is a breeze.  If you don't, it can be an irritant.

I cannot agree more with the previous reviewer. Professor Ristau is the single most worst teacher I have ever had in three and half years at this college. She is absolutely horrible. She cannot keep facts straight and will teach material incorrectly and then announce that if it appears on the test and you mix it up she will not take away points....well, that is just wrong in general because she should get the material right, but you will find out that that is a big fat lie. She will take points away from you and be very happy to do so. Her tests are incoherrent, make no sense and cannot even be understood by other Psych professors. She will take points away from students after marking their answers correct and then deciding it was not a right answer, gets annoyed at students for using their intellect and arguing with her that her answers are not right from tests. As I am sitting here, attempting to study for her final, I am realizing that she does not even know the material, but seems to lift it straight from the book, almost word for word, and obviously does not even possess the intellectual capacity to come up with her own examples. She treats her students like infants and has a tendency to make you feel like you are in seventh grade again. She discovered that students did not do the reading for the class right after an exam and then proceeded to test us in class and pick out individuals to see if they had done the reading. As a senior Psych major I was forced into taking this class this semester. If she ever teaches this class again, DO NOT take it! You should suffer through Balsalm rather than subject yourself to the insanity of this teacher.

Sigh, this class made me really sad.  I came into the class expecting a comprehensive overview of Japan over the past 100 years.  Instead I got images of umbrellas and a lot of sex.  Pflugfelder decided to show history through images. The problem with that is he never really tells us anything about history.  It's all well and good that the Japanese like to depict their political figures as catfish, but I definitely have no idea who those political figures are, what their importance is, or pretty much about anything relating to history.  The textbook is also extremely dry when it comes to political matters.  It seems like Pflugfelder had very little invested in this class and didn't even attend the last two weeks of lectures.  The only saving grace of this class was the TA, Federico, who was incredibly intelligent and, believe it or not, actually taught us some things about Japan -- in the Twentieth Century no less!

After reading the April 2003 review, I was terrified when I was switched into Adam Berlin's class from another section of S&S2.  Now that the semester is almost over, it has been my favorite class and he's the best instructor I've had at Columbia.  By contrast, the ONE full professor I've had at Columbia has been far less accessible, timewise and intellectually.  
It seems to me that the April 2003 reviewer wasn't familiar with the concept of a workshop, they aren't meant to give you exercises to get the juices flowing.  At this level, you're expected to do that yourself and come to class prepared.  A first draft needn't be perfect, but there's no hand-holding, either.  We worked hard, we  carefully read and critiqued one another's work and I think everyone got a lot out  of it.  Adam led the discussion in a way that was respectful and encouraged participation.  And it was fun!
Technically, he's conservative -- he cares about good, old-fashioned, character-
driven (e.g. characters the reader can care about, rather than crazy plot twists) prose with a beginning, middle and an end.  Compared to another class I had here, which was full of nonsensical, metafiction where I felt like I was underwater while reading, this is the real deal.
Although he's clearly a fiction guy, he was patient enough to read several extra poems and revisions, as well as give me extensive feedback on them.  He consistently went above and beyond the call of duty.  I was especially impressed that he wrote about 700 words of feedback for each assignment, and was available before and after class, as well as by email.  That's more than I can say for a lot of my Columbia instructors.  Bottom line:  Adam Berlin has made me a better writer.
They really should hire him full time or at least for a fiction workshop, which he'd obviously excel in.  I can't recommend Adam Berlin's class highly enough.

I decided to take this class with Stuart because he had received only glowing reviews on Culpa and I was excited to have what I believed to be an enthusiastic and informative teacher. One semester later, I have not only learned very little about music but I feel like a part of my enthusiasm for music in general has died. In class Stuart is very friendly and chatty, and thus ends up wasting upwards of 10 minutes before each class talking about how much we have to do; needless to say, we ended up not covering a good portion of the syllabus. Those topics that we did cover tended to be muddled by A) mindless philosophical conversation tangentially related to music by students uniformed in the details of both philosophy and music and B) a discouraging disclaimer at the beginning of most units on why Stuart didn't like the period. This total absence of class structure and efficiency was worsened by the lack of consistency between Stuart's teaching style and grading style. On a number of occasions, Stuart came to class unwilling to teach and content to instead chat about a topic of our choice, but papers and exams were graded rather harshly.

Gaja was an absolutely amazing professor. I came to the class after many frustrated attempts to pass the language requirement - I'd been to the French department, Spanish department, Italian... etc., and all had failed me. So it was a great relief to discover this course which lets you satisfy the requirment in one semester. It was so easy!!! For a start, no conjugation tables because all persons conjugate the same way in Esperanto. And there's only one type of verb (-i), instead of -er, -re, -ar, -ir, blah blah blah of other languages. And easy vocab as well! By the end of the semester I was basically fluent, even having done hardly any of the work outside class. Oh, and Prof Gaja is the best. We even had an Esperanto Symposium at the end of the semester. Definitely take Complete Esperanto if he's teaching or even if its available with someone else.

Worst class ever. I went in thinking that this was going to be an interesting class about how pollution affects the economy and what I got was Intermediate Micro 2. The class does deal with environmental policy but the mathematical aspect of it. The only good thing is that you don't need a biology background to understand the class.

Joel is foreign like other math professors.  However, his writing on the board is mostly clear and note taking is not a problem usually.

Professor Garafola embodies the saying ""Train hard, fight easy."" Although she is one of the toughest professors I have ever had, her standards go beyond what is expected of students in many graduate level history programs. If you get it right with her, you know your stuff. From writing style, to typos in footnotes and bibiographies, to quering sources and not relying on printed facts as accurate, garafola pushes students to think with accuracy. Although her standards are rigorous, Garafola also appreciates a creative and innovative approach to the work. She is not asking students to spit back the opinions she put forth in the classroom. Garafola really knows her stuff, and demands the highest standards in her class. Once it is done, the class is really worth the work!

In the beginning I was kind of scared, because I'd heard from a few people that she was as good as it gets.  I could only think that if this is as good as it is, what did that say about the rest of the department?  It turns out I was just being judgmental and dumb.  I was convinced she wouldn't be teaching much because on the very first day she ran around the class mumbling in Japanese to herself.  
Okamoto-sensei is very nice, adorable, and really a good teacher.  The review given to her from Jap III is right on and also true in level 1.  Sometimes she says words or phrases we just don't know, but she pauses and explains herself when she sees the blank looks around the class.  Her interactive activities are often bizarre and involve us making small talk with partners in the class without much plan, but whether or not it's overly original and fun, I've learned in this class.

If you think she's scatterbrained you're just not keeping up. The woman takes this lack-directional course and sets clear focus throughout the semester. If you think her digressions into Iran are spurradic and disorienting, it's because you don't quite get the leaps she's making in her head. It took me a while to get it, but when I finally did I realized what she was giving us was the tools to take these texts appart and analyze them in a way which I've never been able to before.

Andrea is a great professor in the sense that he doesn't try to force-feed his own opinions on the students.  Instead, he tries to get students to bring their own ideas into the discussion.  After all, you can sit in a class and get information all day long, but how often are students encouraged to develope their own ideas in order to share them with other students.  The point of the academia is not to just learn the facts behind what these thinkers were saying, but to challenge the ideas and take things from them in order to create your own ideas.  Andrea understands, and helps to foster these ideas in a receptive environment. Who cares if the class is easy, if you are concerned with getting challenged in CC, then you are obviously disillisioned as to the nature of the class itself.   If you want a CC section that is purely didactic in nature, then look elsewhere.  If, however, you want to have a forum to developement your own ideas, this is the section for you.

Be warned that although this class sounds easy (for ""non-scientists"") it isn't. The actual subject is easy but the way it is sometimes presented or tested is very confusing.
The most difficult thing I struggled with was the wording of the questions on mini-exams and homework. They are  very ambiguous and unclear.
However, she is a very nice person and will answer all your questions. She answers emails quickly and takes participation into account. 
Overall, I don't think I would recommend this class though. If you like biology, take a reall class and if you just want to get  easy credits for the science requirements, this is not the way to go.
The class is somewhat philosophical. Discussing evolution and questions relating to it was interesting.

Spivak team-taught this course with Hamid Dabashi. It's the required course for grad students who wish to join the Center for Comparative Lit. & Society (CCLS), and do comp. lit. Though perhaps Spivak prefers teaching undergrads, I simply CANNOT express WHAT A TOTAL NIGHTMARE AND UTTER DISASTER this course was. WORSE than useless, because if I hadn't taken it I wouldn't have been treaten badly, screamed at, insulted, given NO syllabus and had my final grade LOST for nearly a semester even though I submitted multiple copies of the final paper punctually! (I had to beg CCLS to finally issue my grade and had the distinct feeling that no one had actually read my final paper in the end). Spivak behaved like a prima donna throughout when she wasn't actively arguing with poor Dabashi. 
The syllabus was never typed up and passed out... it lacked any kind of coherent structure and I never did understand why they'd chosen the items they did...and the logistical arrangements (once we were assigned a video--they refused to tell us the title in advance, then put it on reserve the evening before our 9:00 AM seminar of approx. 30 people, so basically no one could watch it, then Spivak yelled at us that we were ""self-infantilizing"" and useless) were delegated to Spivak's undoubtedly overworked secretary (Spivak apparently doesn't answer her own email). All this AFTER each of us practically had to go through a Broadway show audition to prove that we were worthy to be in the class. We also were placed in a classroom in east campus, which was locked and the keys weren't given to the instructors. Since they showed up late quite often (once Spivak didn't even show up and at that point Dabashi was refusing to teach simultaneously with her, so they alternated) we had to wait in a courtyard outside in the cold. Surely they could've planned that better?  I could go on, but I'll just relate one more anecdote: Spivak mis-heard (literally!! she must be getting deaf) a student's question, assumed he'd insulted people from the Third World, then yelled at him for a good 10 minutes. Dead silence, then he pipes up and explains that she had misunderstood. She didn't apologize, but said that she was done for the day and left. That was within the first 10 minutes of our once-per-week, 1.5 hour seminar. So since she hadn't told us our homework and there was no syllabus, we all just left too. Quality education!!!

Under NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you take a class with Steinkoler.  She may know about Freud and psychoanalysis, but does not care much for English literature itself, which this class should be about. She mixed up characters, read off disorganized scribbled notes, and totally ignored a comment if it conflicted with her ideas. An extremely hilarious moment in class was when she gave us an overview of Greek history; what she did was print off a timeline from the Internet and picked up important events and nervously read them to us--One good thing about this woman is that she knows A LOT about NYC; she'll give you tons of info on lectures that you can attend for extra credit (of course, on psychoanalysis but these for the most part are really good), museums, operas, and even tango classes.  Her grading isn't that bad; a bit strict on the first draft and she only has minimal office hours which she skips when she's ""tired"", but not that different from other First Year English profs.

I came to Barnard never dreaming of majoring in bio, however taking class with Hertz changed my mind. Though this class is hard, its never because of his lack of organization, it simply covers a ton of material (understanding the immune system thoroughly in one lecture is IMPOSSIBLE).  Be SURE to do the readings AND go to the lecture; you'll find questions on the exam which are uber-specific, that if you've laxed on either the readings or the lectures for more than a week, you're screwed. His lecture skills aren't exactly great, but about average, though he does manage to pack a ton of information into a 50 minute lecture; taking notes with a laptop is highly recommended, as is sitting in the front of the class. Be sure to be on time, as you can only pick up the lecture outlines before 9, and yes, class begins at 9 sharp. He'll give you the outlines after class if you were late, but having the outline during the lecture is nearly crucial. 
If you're not a biology major but needs to fulfill a lab requirement, I'd highly recommend taking this class. You could of course take the 1000 level class, but if you're looking for a challenge, definitely take it, the lab section ( a different course) isn't that hard either.

Overall, nice guy, a little on the quirky side. He has a really strange sense of humor and has a tendency to talk at the ground or into the sky. Each class had a general topic (eg. ""Today we'll talk about Wagner"") but tended to go off on all sorts of tangents. Big on the history, thought, and culture surrounding music. Also big on German words for musical things. Tries to teach music in an un-music way, but it doesn't actually work out because he tends to use music jargon and to really understand what he's saying you have to have some music theory background. He's a composer, so expect a skew in the syllabus towards 20th century music. Reading from the book is not necessary although helpful, class notes are what he tests you on.

Where to begin? If you can avoid taking a class with this professor, at all costs, please do so. Personally, I learned absolutely nothing from this teacher because of his disorganization, digression, and tendencies to show off all of his knowledge (such as his abilities to ""speak"" Latin, Italian, and French).  I had to teach myself everything for the final (which counts for 40% of your grade).  We had no grades throughout the course, and so it was impossible to judge how I was doing.  I dreaded attending each and every class- they were boring (I looked at the clock every 5 minutes, praying it would end soon) and I came out only confused.

Derrick is a cool guy. He likes it when people speak out and share their opinions, and participation counts for a substantial portion of the grade. He will point out logical inconsistencies or biases in your argument, but is welcoming and respectiful of many differring points of view. He once got upset with our class, accusing us of attempting to figure out his viewpoints in our papers, and then writing them to cater to this impression because he wants students to really write what they think, and he won't mark you down if he disagrees with you. I found his grading fair, but others in the class found it hard. I suppose he is tougher than most, but if you put effort into your papers, you'll do well. He likes narrowed down, focused papers with some depth of analysis in them. (If you address the prompt from a slightly odd but interesting angle is perfectly ok)  He does a lot of close reading in class, which I found very effective. For instance, it's a smart tactic because it acknowledges that a lot of people either don't do the reading, or get behind on it (though the class will be so much more valuable personally if you do -- the lit hum readings are really really great) and then can still participate because they've just read the passage the class is discussing.

In my opinion, Garrett is the best that you can get for this core class. He is very intelligent, and knowledgeble about so many different areas and subjects that at times it can be a little intimidating! Yet, at the same time, our class was never boring, the discussions were always animated and interesting, and he has a great sense of humor. He also spends as much time reading and commenting on your essay as you spend writing them, and I feel that he is a very fair grader. He gives very helpful comments, is also available to meet with, and really helps you improve your writing. I think that pretty much my whole class respected him and enjoyed our discussions. My only complaint was that we fell a little behind in terms of when our papers were assigned and due, but this was partially because our class got so involved in discussions that we spent a little too much time on the articles in the begining of the class than we should have. Another good thing: unlike most UW teachers, 'peer review' for our class was completely anonymous, so that your paper was not torn apart in class, which I really appreciated. 
Workload:
Yes, you have to work hard for this class, but it is completely worth it. However, if you are just looking for a class that will be an easy A, BS-ing class, this is not the class for you. In the begining, one to two short papers and reading a week, later in the semester three big papers, a group project, and a retrospective paper. I can't stress this enough though: if you have the chance to take Garrett's class, take it!!!

This class was certainly...interesting (for lack of a better word). Segal is quite pompous and arrogant. He tells awful, often offensive jokes every class and thinks he is very important especially since his last book was published (and yes, we all had to buy it). His most popular joke topics are Jews/Judaism (he's a Reform rabbi who basically rejected the pulpit and has made it clear he's much happier now that he's not observant), women (how can a Barnard professor make such mean Barnard jokes?), and the government (total Bush hater). His lectures were occassionally interesting. The only reason to show up to class is that it makes writing the three 4-5 page papers of the course easier since he goes over each topic. Segal also is a big fan of technology but really doesn't know how to use it. He wastes so much time trying to manipulate the projector and DVD player. He is also often late to class since he's a Jersey commuter. As long as you semi-answer the question asked for the paper topic, you'll get an A. Such easy grading it's ridiculous. This class is also a total jock class...I had practically the entire football and wrestling team in my class. It fufills a Barnard requirement and is an incredibly easy A.

Professor Cohen is fabulous! He has a great sense of humor and really apprciates hard work. Cohen gets so excited about music theory during our lectures. It's so great to see someone so passionate about the class. One-on-one he's a little intimidating. Cohen reiterates counterpoint and voice leading rules so often that they are practically drilled into your head. Since he does this so much, Cohen also expects his students not to make those same mistakes over and over and sometimes gets frustrated when they do. He's very friendly and availble for help outside of class. Syllabus is a little vague and I'm not quite sure how grades will work out since only 3 homeworks actually had grades. Overall, I really loved Professor Cohen's class and highly recommend it to others. He's a great guy!

Pollack takes some getting used to, but he's a thorough and thoughtful instructor. Expect to do poorly on the first exam: since there's no feedback (no homework assignments), it's very hard to discern what you're supposed to retain from the lecture and readings.  Nonetheless, if you attend the lectures/recitation and do all the reading, you will learn a tremendous amount in this class.

First off, Prof. Jaanus is simply an extremely nice person.  The class in general tended to drag when we looked at theory (all Lacan) and the theory-based readings were terrible.  When discussion focused on a literary text, however, the class was almost enjoyable (for a thursday 6-8pm class, thats a feat).  The course load was extremely light (can easily get away with reading practically nothing), just some response papers at the beginning of the semester and then the thesis  on topic of your choosing (20-25 pages) at the end.

On the first day of class, Prof. Friedman will likely scare away all students who are intimidated by the prospect of critically analyzing the foremost political theorists of our time.  But for those who can put up with the pretentious Harvard-knows-what's-best aspect of the class and who don't mind spending an hour and 15 minutes twice a week (plus as many hours as it takes to read, which is really up to the student, the more time you spend, the more you read, the time spent, the more you'll probably get out of discussions) thinking critically in the abstract, take this class, because Prof. Friedman is incredible, given the fact that he has the ability to make a class on ""liberalism, communitarianism, and the good"" into a discussion.  This is due mostly to the fact that he is a fabulous listener.   He has a remarkable ability to understand what his students are saying when they struggle to articulate, and he uses it to clarify what student was trying to say to the class and to the student.  He asks open-ended questions to get students to think out loud.  The only problem with this method is that sometimes his questions are a little too pointed, and it seems there is something very specific that he wants to hear.  My advice if you're taking this class, don't be too teleological.  There is no ultimate meaning that the whole class is leading up to (although Friedman will make it seem like there is).  The details and all the tangents are often the most stimulating parts, so enjoy them.

   He has a heavy french accent but he is generous man with massive curves. I almost never went to classes because there were people from my floor who went for me and I basically got their notes. For midterms and final, he gives extremely helpful midterm and final training problems. (a few of them are always on the acutal exam too!). Take this class if you are not going to class, but you can learn out of books. Just take a brief note and write down formulas to study for exams and you will easily get above 85.

A really fantastic and amazing teacher. With such a drab and potentially loathsome curriculum, Heather transformed our classroom into a place of creative and fascinating learning. Even though she is well-read, articulate and lightyears beyond the first years she teaches, Heather never once exuded an air of pretentiousness or condescension. Instead, she is extremely accommodating and easy to be around. She's not a teacher who makes up for the lack of years between her and her students by putting up a front. 
Class is based around discussion of materials, with gentle direction from Heather, and you find yourself surprised at the end of the hour and a half how much material has been covered in such a digestable and easy fashion. 
University Writing took the spot as my earliest class at Columbia this semester, but Heather really worked hard to make sure the material stayed both inviting and invigorating to keep us awake. As a result, our class had a stellar attendance rate, with only a few students missing class throughout the term due to illness, etc. 
Her teaching style distinguishes itself on stressing the craft of writing as well as the argument behind it. Writing an essay for her consisted of caring both about the claim you're making and the way it's presented, something that had not been one of my priorities going in but certaintly showed its worth at the end of the term. She stresses the importance of the discursive community, making you aware that your goal is to be fully cognizant of the audience and how they would feel about your writing.
Heather made herself accessible outside of the classroom more so than the rest of my teachers, sending out mass emails frequently and encouraging us to call her cell if problems came up while we were writing essays or reading material for class. Office hours ended up being a great discussion time relating the reading material to the discursive community or a chance for Heather to recommed further reading. 
Columbia should consider itself lucky to have a fabulous teacher who is not sucked down by the quagmire that could be University Writing. Heather instead takes complete control of the class and reading. By doing so, she creates a class that will change the way you think and approach your academic life.
Workload:

Richard Billows, like every one else has been saying, does tend to keep you 10 and sometimes 15 minutes after class in lecture/  The lectures were however really intriguinf and he is quite vibrant and colorful in lecutring, meaning it would be hard to fall asleep.  I heard he is an easy grader and he probably is, I did very well on the midterm, but it is annoying to memorize and study for the million IDs.  If you want an interesting course with a pretty lenient professor, take this one. 
One thing I found annoying were the recitations. I am not sure whether they were mandatory or not, but I found them quite useless. We did not go over anything relevant to the exams and my TA, Stephen, mumbled all during rec so everyone ends up falling asleep.

Although there are mixed reviews of this guy, I personally liked him. I went to every lecture because he made them so interesting with great demonstrations and interesting facts. He is very interesting to talk to and almost always available. Don't expect him to hold your hand and walk you through how to do problems in the lectures, he teaches beyond the text book, which is why you're at Columbia, so grow up and don't whin if you have to read the book and figure some stuff out on your own, besides, there is always recitation and office hours to help you.
