The biggest mistake I made my freshman year was lookup Mark Lilla's (then with a golden nugget) reviews and choose his class. Mark Lilla asks his students to write CULPA reviews which makes it much more likely that students who are partial to him write him good reviews.
Grades  : Mark Lilla is not the kind of teacher you want if you want good grades. Very biased, judges on style (subjective) rather than on content. He is also very partial to specific people, as one might observe during class.
Content : Mark Lilla is very opinionated. He will only teach what he think is right, and he will only focus on the part of the text that he is interested in. Any questions leading to some other topic, regardless of how important it may be, will be dismissed.
Workload: Mark Lilla's ridiculously enormous sense of self importance about himself and his class makes him assign a massive amount of work that he expects to be done with top priority.
Given that, there are some students who do well in that class and those students are very specific to Mark Lilla's taste, and there is not really much of a correlation between whether they are good writers or not. Mark Lilla is very paternally condescending and demeaning, which does make some students worship him, but overall makes his class unpleasant.

Prof Miller is absolutely amazing and I would (and do!) recommend both her and this class to everyone who asks. She is an utter delight, extremely approachable, and possibly the nicest and most well-meaning professor I've encountered in my time here. The texts she chooses are gripping and insightful to the period and its various movements, and she is always sure to sprinkle in historically relevant details that pertain to the works we read. She is (obviously) intelligent, witty, and passionate.
The class I was in was in the morning and so often her questions were met with silence, which was disappointing, but that's the fault of the class, not the professor. Miller somehow managed to make a subject I'd always been interested in even better, more approachable, more manageable, etc. Although the class was very heavy in reading (it's an English course, so that should be expected), it never seemed insurmountable because of the quality of the works she'd selected; frankly put, it never really seemed a chore to do the readings for this class, and for that I am thankful.
Workload:
Very reading heavy but it was interesting and engaging; 5 pg paper on ""theories & poetic praxis"" of Harlem Renaissance modernism, report on a historic site in Harlem, 5-7 pg paper on subject of student's choice, final exam

Karen is a wonderful teacher. She is tough and won't put up with any bullshit but she will help you improve your french like no other. She encourages you to speak, won't give you straight answers but rather, explain things to you in French or aid you in understanding it on your own. Her critique of speaking and homework is constructive and never hurtful and she is a great, funny woman. 
If you do the homework and you are willing to learn you will go far in her class with a good grade
Workload:
Few quizzes, homework 2x a week (workbook activities or handout sheets), midterm and final exam

I do not know why there are not many reviews on Karen already. TAKE HER. Any class you can take with her-- I GUARANTEE that you will learn so much French. Her accent is extremely clear, the assignments are manageable, and even the literature she selects (for more advance French) is incredibly interesting.
Aside from that, she cares. She really wants you to learn, and again, I guarantee you will. 
Workload:
Very very manageable, about 3 compositions, sometimes a few readings. It all depends on the level of French, but she is very straightforward and understanding.

This is the first lab I have ever taken and while she does talk us through the majority of the steps, talks for way too long and gives us so many contradicting suggestions that nothing she says ever makes sense. She seems very willing to help with any questions you may have via e-mail and will even review your lab report drafts prior to the due date with very helpful criticism but seems to enjoy taking points off of you. She constantly contradicts herself and makes lab more challenging than it already is. 
Willing to help yet makes things unnecessarily more difficult. 
I absolutely hated this lab and the experiments were also very dry and uninteresting. If you can avoid this lab, do so.

I am currently in his introduction to economic principles course, the midterm is coming up next week. 
Very easily the WORST teacher I have ever had. It is painful to pay attention in class, he explains concepts in roundabout, borderline incorrect ways and, at times, I am unsure of whether or not he understands basic economic principles himself. He often switches around the supply and demand curves. He uses power points very superficially, in a very unhelpful way. I was planning on being an econ major, but Professor Bossie have have convinced me otherwise. The homework is always waayyy too hard for what has been taught in class. You can do it by searching concepts online. 

Workload:
Homework every 2 weeks, 30% of grade
30% midterm
40% final

Get in someone else's class if you can. She assigns so much homework online and in the grammar book. Also, in the grammar book, you can't just bring your book to class and let her check it- you have to write it in your book, scan it, then upload it to Courseworks by midnight. It's such a hassle, and she gets easily annoyed if something goes wrong in uploading it. She doesn't care if you can open your grammar book and show her you did it. Like the last reviewer said, she laughs all time and no one knows why. That was cool with me in the beginning, but I started to notice that sometimes she would be laughing at the way some people spoke Spanish. If they used the wrong words or said it really slowly or something, she would giggle at them. Lastly, I noticed that a lot of people in my class had no idea what was going on most of the time because of the way she taught. The most common example of this in her class was she would speak super fast and then stare at us. We would stare back.Finally we would figure out that she had just told us to do some activity, but literally no one understood her well enough to know what to do initially. She isn't the best professor, honestly. Find another one.
Workload:
A lot of work in the grammar book (usually took me about 3 hours, including scanning and uploading), Myspanishlab work due every week, two tests, oral exam, compositions, video project.

Professor Pagano is one of the best teachers I've ever had. I had a tough start adjusting to my first year and he was completely understanding, showing nothing but concern. He really cares about his students and the subject he teaches, and is completely friendly and open to further conversations about anything, class related or not. I like that during class discussions, unlike a lot of teachers here who just ask the students pretentious questions and expect them to competitively continue on, he interjects with really brilliant thoughts and interesting questions. He also doesn't force his opinion on you. He's just a really great teacher and person in general. Great start to my year and my day.

For Enchanted Imagination there can be a lot of reading at times, but most of it is fun to read anyway. You also have to write freewrites for every reading assignment about a page and a half long. They can be a pain if you're rushing but they always guarantee you have something to talk about the next day.
