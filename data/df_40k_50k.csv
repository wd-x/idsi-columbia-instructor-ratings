I'm echoing everything that the previous reviewer said.  The only reason I ended up sticking with the class was because I needed to take a political science colloquium and I wasn't able to switch out. NEVER NEVER NEVER take anything with this professor.  He's totally incompetent, unprofessional and his grading really is all over the place.  The syllabus is terrible - The readings are insanely long (to the point where nobody ever finishes them) and the discussions are even worse.  Also my worst experience at Columbia.  I felt like my insane tuition money was a complete waste that semester.  It's an unengaging, frustrating class in which you will inevitably be stressed about grading (because he's so vague and all over the place) and won't learn anything other than Columbia is a self-interested institution that doesn't care about students and that there is only luck to thank when you find a good professor.  See! Cynicism.  Avoid this class.

Wow. I don't know if Chem Lab changed radically over the past year or so, but I definitely didn't take the same class as those who gave it raving reviews, claiming they learned so much. I spoke to a lot of the people in my lab last semester as well and they agreed -- there was little to nothing redeeming about this course. It's designed so you feel like you're constantly thrown into its vicious, tedious cycle week after week and makes the semester drag on and on. Even as somebody who received an A in the class (it's not hard to), it felt like a COMPLETE waste of time doing so.
So. The vicious cycle: 
1) Go to lab lecture, which is basically just Sarah talking about stuff you've probably learned or will learn in General Chemistry. Be forced to ""work with the people around you"" in an attempt to make it engaging (it's not). Take a 15 minute quiz that, half the time will have a 70% average. Watch points get deducted over the most anal errors, thus making you feel like you're absolutely awful at chemistry (you're not that bad, stay strong, friend). 
2) They take attendance at the end, so guess what? You're not getting out of lecture. 
3) Go to lab. 3-4 hours of pain, depending on if Hansen wants to tack on EXTRA labs/lab stuff to make her class seem more legitimate and less like a high school chemistry lab. The room has poor air circulation, but somehow it's always a bit nippy, and the TAs are half snarky, half nice. Once you finish (YAYYYYY!) you get out of Havemeyer, your spirits raised... until you realize you have to do it again... but only after... 
4) Completing pre-lab (the most USELESS assignment ever, designed to force you to thoroughly read and copy down all the lab instructions... that have been altered by Hansen... and compare that to what's in the actual manual and write them all down). 
5) Completing report sheets, that you will inevitably lose points on somewhere. 
6) Dry lab! Because your time in the lab wasn't enough to convince you guys this class is taken [way too] seriously. 
7) Writing assignments. (...really?) 
8) Repeat for the next few months. 
I'd like to point out, all the work would be 100% fine in my books if it felt like it was reinforcing something, or clarifying my understanding of chemistry. But nope! It just felt like my time was getting sucked away from other classes and into this. I don't know what Hansen thinks, but this class is NOT her students' only class (nor, based on the conversations I've had with many, remotely close to their favorite). 
Prepare to have a sense of ""Ughhh, not again..."" overwhelm you each week.

I don't agree with the negativity from the last post. I was in the very same class and contributed to discussion with regularity. Though the conversation was occasionally run by one side of the classroom, Yvonne's effect on class discussion was  effective. She frequently tried to rearrange the class dynamic through fun group exercises that did create an atmosphere conducive to learning. Moreover, she always looked to advance class discussion beyond the surface of the text. Usually, the class just didn't want to go there. Yvonne looked to inspire those that wanted to learn and was less concerned with those that would just Sparknote the books and show up to class because they had to, which in my mind separates the bulls from the steers. Yvonne was a boss. If you want a good LitHum professor who rewards you for critical thinking and actually reading the text, give her a shot.

It's impossible for Hansen to  possibly be any more in love with (as mentioned in another r view) her ""creation!"" She acts like it's everybody's only class, assigning ungodly amounts of work (useless, busy work) and expecting victims to treat chem lab like a part time job. You get out of lab just to be thrown into more lab work.

This class is and probably will remain a huge dissapointment. My recommendation which seems to be pretty popular is simply do not take this class. This was the first big lecture class I took where the professor held discussion section during class time. Which makes me wonder how she feels about collecting a paycheck when she barely shows up. I guess it's an added bonus of having tenure. By just reading her book and her wiki page you will know more about global cities then sitting through one of her long and disjointed lectures. 
Basically her teaching style is unorganized and lazy. Even with it being an easy A class, I don't think it's worth the time or money. Interesting topic but poor poor delivery!

The class moves pretty slowly for a 4000 level CS class and covers the qualitative components of Computer Science (planning, group dynamics, etc). Don't let the name fool you, there is nothing ""advanced"" about this course. It is interesting that we get to work on a project of our choosing over the course of the semester, but the amount of documentation we have to provide beforehand is a little infuriating. You end up spending 3x more time writing out requirements, risk, etc than writing code. 
You will probably have to take this class because it is required for Software Systems, and let me say that this is not a ""bad"" class. You still learn concepts like design patterns, but ultimately you will learn MUCH more if you take a class like Operating Systems or Computer Networks.

She is young and very friendly. Because of the fun atmosphere of this class I look forward to it, even though the content can be confusing at times. Maria does a good job of making the lessons relatively clear and straight-forward, yet is not very good at keeping the class on track. There are a few distractions and off-topic discussions each class, but they usually pertain to greek culture or stem from that at least.
She could definitely do a better job at explaining some grammar. If you are 100% new to modern greek grammar I would recommend looking up an online guide or using youtube videos to help you understand because it can be easy to get lost.

NICOLE GERVASIO IS A GODDESS. I AM UPSET THAT SHE DOES NOT ALREADY HAVE A GOLD NUGGET. HELLO? IT'S BEEN LIKE 2 YEARS.
Taking UW with Nicole is what inspired me to be an English major. She is so approachable and dedicated to making her students better writers. She is available as a resource at every step of the way, from random ideas and breakdowns to a full-fledged ~progression~. 
She is also just in general a really chill person and I've kept in touch with her since leaving that class! If you have taken the intro to the English major, ENGL 3001, you know it is pretty much the 7th circle of hell if you don't have a good seminar leader. I'm taking it this semester and I am genuinely sad that I can't take it again next semester (Spring 2015) and have Nicole as a seminar leader!!

This class was truly disappointing. It's such an interesting topic, but the syllabus is just one boring, unreadable, pointless book after another. 2/3 of the course is dedicated to medieval/ancient texts that sort of relate to disability, but not enough to make us have to endure reading them. Seriously, it goes beyond boring mainstays like Beowulf and Canterbury Tales (although you read those too) - the syllabus approaches a whole next level of boring. You spend an entire class discussing ""History and Topography of Ireland,"" which is pretty much the ancient Irish equivalent of a mystical TripAdvisor entry. I still have no idea how it could possibly be even remotely relevant. Then there's the class about ""The Life of St. Osith,"" which may have been even more dreadful than the Ireland book! Pope, Montaigne and Locke each get their own classes too, and while they are all certainly very important to the study of western literature, they really don't have much to say about disability. You'd be better off taking a class just on 17th century lit. Professor Baswell is a nice guy, and he knows his stuff, but the class itself is miserable.

Overall, I recommend not taking this course.
The ideas behind this course are simple: think in terms of the customer and plan your project accordingly. Unfortunately, a lot of the documentation we do is not really meaningful, and the pace of the class could be faster. We spend several weeks on design patterns, and another several weeks on ""bug testing"", which is stuff you pretty much already know. 
If you want to challenge yourself on your road to becoming a fully-fledged Computer Scientist, don't take this class. If you are looking for an easy course to take on the side, while knocking out your tech electives, you might consider ASE. This class is not really ""Advanced Software Engineering"", it should be called ""Software Project Planning for Enterprise"". 
The midterm reflected the course. It was pretty easy, with just definitions and written explanations of concepts. But at the end of the day, how much did you learn compared to a class like OS or Algorithms?

DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!  Let me save you a load of trouble now.  I know what you're probably thinking (because it's what I thought when I signed up for this class).  Feminist media theory?  Sounds like you talk about women in film and television and journalism and just have a blast!  False.  Absolutely false.  For the first 3 weeks, we did discuss these topics, but after those 3 weeks, Beller completely abandoned the ""feminist"" aspect of the course and just went back to teaching what he teaches in the fall, Media Theory.  Not once did Beller explain what his definition of ""Media Theory"" was, which left me feeling totally lost whenever I tried to discuss it in class or write a paper about it.  After the first 3 weeks of class we started doing readings on posthumanism and cybernetics.  What are those, you may be asking?  I haven't the slightest idea.  Beller assigned us readings on these topics in which the authors assumed you already knew what they were, then in class, Beller would discuss them as though we were masters on the subject, and never once attempted to define them for us.  He is also terrible about scheduling.  He ended his class late every single week, he forgot to grade my midterm, and then handed my midterm back to me the week before the final was due.  I feel that I should also mention that there was one week in which he encouraged a discussion that got a few students seriously fighting (not debating, fighting) to the point where one of them started to cry, and he did nothing to stop it.  It was completely unprofessional of him and I felt uncomfortable for the entirety of that 2 hour class.

I have never regretted taking a class more in my life. If I could go back in time and change one thing in my life... I'm almost positive that this is what I would change. Besides the fact that Remez is incapable of teaching, the tests are impossible. The only thing that might save you is the curve and your ability to guess on tests. This class makes me disappointed that any part of our tuition may go towards paying this man. He clearly takes advantage of the fact that he's the head of the department and enjoys the power. 
The classes are dry and perhaps the most boring class you could ever take. The reading is also arguably a collection of the most tedious and boring paragraphs ever. To top it all off, the tests do not represent the amount of effort you put in or the knowledge you have on Perception. The tests are just a representation of how well you guessed for the most part. He curves the class a great amount but it is still not worth the torture. 
The lab is also THE WORST LAB I have ever taken. If Alison Baren is still signed up to teach it, please be mindful of the fact that she is most incompetent teacher at this school. She doesn't understand the material that well and will blame you for not understanding. She seems to take her own personal frustration on her students which also makes it very difficult to learn.

Even if you aren't remotely interested in history, even if you hold the misguided idea that medieval history has nothing to do with your life, you should take this class. 
Professor Kaye is one of the best teachers I have ever had. He genuinely loves instructing students. I highly recommend going to his office hours. Your ideas will be more valued in this class than in a normal intro survey. Professor Kaye's passion for the study of history is inspiring. He makes medieval history relevant and engaging by constructing a narrative that favors thematic trends rather than a ""fact"" -based history you might get in an AP high school class. The best parts of Intro to the Later Middle Ages are Professor Kaye's lectures, but the readings are also interesting and applicable to the class as a whole.

This was absolutely the best course I have ever taken, and Professor Gondek was the best professor I have ever had. I recommend this class to anyone—not even just sustainable development students (though to be honest, I feel that this class should be mandatory in the sustainable development program).
In Ethics of Sustainable Development, you will learn about the ethical fallacies of unsustainable development and their causes, as well as the idea that to be sustainable, development must be ethical. The ethical fallacies include human hegemony, consumerist modernity and utilitarian technocracy. These terms are technical but they encompass concepts that define our lives. You will learn a framework that you can use to judge ""why"" certain decisions and assumptions in human civilization are ethically problematic, beyond just the gut feeling you get that something is wrong when you hear about a firm displacing villagers from their land or a scientist saying that technology can solve any problem. Everyone would benefit from this course—science, economics, political science, and engineering majors.
Unfortunately this is the only way I can describe this class, as the bulk of the experience you get is from Professor Gondek's unbelievable ability to break down complex issues in a comprehensible and interesting manner; no one ever skipped class, and conversations outside of class always pertained to just how amazing Professor Gondek is. I dare you to go to her office hours just to ask her a simple question; I promise you that you will end up staying with her for hours talking to her about life (such has been the case with everyone who has ever had her as a professor). I even heard a rumor that she is the only Columbia Professor to consistently get 100% ratings every semester on university-wide class evaluations. Take this class!

Roughly 100 pages of reading a week, all on interesting topics pertaining to various disciplines; everyone did the readings because they were that interesting, though you really only have to skim them.

You have to do 8 discussion posts for the whole semester, and there are two papers and a final presentation.

Not a great professor, but she might get better as this was her first time teaching. At first she seemed incredibly cheerful and bubbly and I was excited to be taking Animal Behavior with her, but there are two main issues that quickly became apparent during this course.
Firstly, her email policy is a bit unreasonable considering how hectic Columbia/Barnard student schedules are. Although she repeatedly prides herself on being accessible, I found her policies strange and her behavior overall inaccessible. She would only look at emails made to set up meeting requests, and ignore any other questions, comments or concerns sent via email. This alone is not the worst policy, but I found that when I tried to talk to her after class she would often just tell me to set up a meeting with her, and when I tried to set up a meeting with her via email she would refuse to schedule a meeting between us since I am at work during her normal office hours. In a particular email in which I was trying to find a time to meet with her to review an exam after she had denied an initial meeting, she got a bit combative with me, which I found unprofessional. Other students may not have had such experiences, but as a particularly busy student I did.
Secondly, her exam grading policies were absurd. On the first exam she would give us a short (maybe 3 inch?) line on which to write 2-3 sentence responses, and then clarified halfway through the test that any parts of answers not directly on the tiny lines would not be graded at all. The second test was better after complaints from students, and hopefully she will not do this in the future. 
The material is the only saving grace of the course. Calisi does know her stuff and the lectures are generally enjoyable and interesting. The material itself isn't too challenging especially after taking intro level bio, and I liked the research-driven focus of the textbook and of the lectures. Calisi's passion for animal behavior is certainly commendable, but the strictures and rules Calisi has set up for her class are not. Although I was disappointed in her this semester, I think in the future she may be a better professor.

I audited four Calc I classes this semester - all with different professors, and Prof. Gorskiy's was by far the most organized and focused lecture that I attended.  He is efficient and doesn't waste lecture time on superfluous topics beyond the ken of Calculus nor digress far from the lesson. At the same time, he is relaxed, approachable, and the work load is more than reasonable. Plus he offers many opportunities for extra credit in both homework and exams. The course requires a WebAssign account, as do many of Columbia's math courses, but the site has many helpful tutorials and includes online access to the book. I believe that the same book is used up through Calc III, so it is a good investment. I highly recommend his class and hope that he teaches Calc II.

Okay, so the year is not even half way through so this might be an early remark to make but I'm pretty positive that my opinion won't change about Professor Kumar, and if it does I promise I will make another comment in the end of the year for those who just HAVE to know what their teacher will be like.
First of all, for those looking to change their lit hum professors for this spring, GET IN THIS COURSE ASAP. 
So many of my peers have been complaining about weekly quizzes and essays they have to type and all the workload of LitHum, the only thing Prof Kumar wants is a simple annotation from a website for some of the works, not even all! The annotations are about five sentences, honestly, you don't even have to read the whole paragraph to comment on a few words. 
I personally find Professor Kumar to be extremely funny and ironic. He will accept any comment (almost) and even if he doesn't agree with you he will never call you out on a comment or judge you. He is super accepting and super super nice. I went to his office hours a couple of times, i must admit he isn't the most straightforward teacher I have had. So if you're looking for a teacher who will very directly frame each and every thing you need to do, don't take his course but then again, framing is not the point of LitHum, commenting and suggesting is and that is exactly what Prof Kumar is trying to accomplish. Also, participation is about 20% of your grade but to be honest i don't think he would ever be too harsh on that. He also never calls people out to answer a question. He said that he is a ""too lenient"" grader so, I don't think anything more should be said.. But I will say, since Prof Kumar is by far my best teacher this semester.
He pays a lot of attention to students, personally getting to know them. By the end of the second month, the class already has many inside jokes going on. I don't think I've ever left a class bored to death even when I didn't read the works before, so no pressure on reading works on time but do know that whereas many teachers read the works in a couple of weeks, prof Kumar goes by the syllabus so you will probably have to read around 500 pages each week. (Like the odyssey in one week basically)
He is also very modest, I've never seen him compliment himself when he obviously is an expert on these works, quoting directly with page numbers almost in each class (impressive?!) 
For those who don't want to read all the boring sentences above, I'll quickly summarize:
TAKE. AKASH'S. COURSE.
TAKE. AKASH'S. COURSE.
TAKE. AKASH'S. COURSE.
TAKE. AKASH'S. COURSE.
On a side note, for those interested in fashion, he dresses pretty interestingly, I'd say. Interesting as in I'll let you decide if that's good or bad.. 
by the way, to the comment below: I personally paid attention to the way his name was said after reading the comment and it is not ""I don't have any uh..cash"", it is actually ""a-KASH"". as in a british person saying ""Car"" with a ""sh"" instead of ""r"".

I really like Webster: he's a great lecturer and person overall. He's very clear and extremely open to questions. My only real complaint is the textbook. 
He makes you buy these pdf textbooks that he has made himself. They're awful. The outline often don't match lectures (as I realized only after the first midterm...), so you should go to lecture to find out what they SHOULD say. The material itself is really easy, so I thought I didn't have to go to class. Wrong. 
Webster is a better lecturer than he is a writer. Go to class. He clearly outlines what he thinks you should know (which excludes a surprising portion of his own textbook sometimes) and explains it better than he does in the textbook. He will actually discount his own textbook and say ""this is the easier way to think about it."" Webster is the best resource in this class. So just show up to 8:40 lecture. It's worth it.

I, like you, read Rieder's reviews before deciding to take Culture in America in fall 2014. I, like you, was pleased! He sounded funny, smart, and engaging, plus when I got the syllabus for the class the readings looked interesting and relevant and original. I was excited!
I was wrong. Rieder is a TERRIBLE lecturer who can turn even the most interesting/relevant/original of reading into an impenetrable mess of esoteric buzzwords. In case you don't believe me, I've included an actual i-shit-you-not direct quote from my lecture notes that should give you a fair idea of what the average Rieder lecture is like: ""the protracted oedipal inversion of taste membership is profoundly evident as a methodological concern in [X reading name]."" 
Do you know what that means? It means this guy is full of shit. Do yourself a favor and don't take this class unless you like treating sociology like you're learning a new goddamn language.

As the other reviewer said: EVS 101 with Bower is a decent way to fufil the lab requirement if you're not a strong science person. Overall, I have enjoyed having class with him, although his tests are relatively difficult(though not impossible). I would say the test(there are three equally weighted tests) average is about 75-85%. There are no curvebals on the tests, and he will not put anything on the tests that he hasn't actually gone over in class. Answers emails very quickly, although is very difficult to get a hold of after class and doesn't really have office hours. 
Also, Professor Terryanne Maenza Gmelch was my lab instructor, and she is lovely and very helpful.

Took him for FYE Legacy of the Mediterranean. Reasonable expectations and is relatively understanding. He's extremely smart, kind of intimidating,and slightly sardonic, but he's a pleasure to have class with. Though, he's not pompous, and he didn't make a point to pontificate about abstract concepts that come up in the reading(unlike some of our more educated class members) 
Not exactly good with getting papers back on time, and could be better about replying to emails faster though. Because he wasn't good about getting our work back to us, a lot of us had a lot of existential dread over our grades.  
I would recommend him overall.

Professor for Italian 1001, decent professor overall. She's relatively kind and understanding. Energetic in class. She's also relatively relate-able, and isn't intimidating at all. 
It would be nice if she actually had some type of formalized office hours. 
She prepared us well for the exams that the department made, although it definitely requires a lot of studying outside of class(I would say that it's at least 5 hours of studying, at most maybe about 10 or 15 per week). If you've already taken some Italian in high school, or know a couple other romance languages, this class will be easier for you.

Let me just start by saying that Professor Messick is obviously incredibly intelligent and knows a lot about Arabia. BUT....and this is a BIG but....He is incredibly pompous and unapproachable. When I did approach him for office hours, he was completely uninterested and unwilling to give any sort of guidance. He is a terribly boring lecturer and no one really pays much attention in this class, and he doesn't really care. There are people who do work out of textbooks on their desks during class right in front of him (we don't even have anything that resembles a textbook for this class) and he either doesn't notice or doesn't care enough to say anything. All he talks about is himself and his experiences in rural Arabia (which can be interesting, but not when its for two hours every single class and has nothing to do with the actual material of the course). This guy is clearly not very into teaching, since he's invested in neither his students nor the course. As previous commenters have mentioned, he doesn't read his students work and gives extremely limited and nonconstructive feedback. His grading scales are also extremely strange; he grades out of 5 for weekly papers, but when asked if that then translates into the numerical grade (i.e. 4/5 means 80, which is a B-) he said no, and that he didn't exactly know how he'd scale it in terms of our letter grade, just that a 5/5 is ""very good"" and a 2/5 is ""not so good."" Also graded our midterm out of 10 (which is worth 30% of the grade) but didn't say what that would translate into either...so it's hard to know where you stand in the class. 
Overall, not difficult to get an okay grade (whatever that means?) but its extremely frustrating when a professor only gives nebulous answers to things and can't (or won't) even define his own grading scale. It's also frustrating not knowing where you stand in the class if you aren't on either extreme side of the grading scale. 
The readings aren't too long or too difficult, they're fine. Overall the class is just fine. You learn more from the readings than from his two hour lectures. 
This is the first class I've taken with him, but you don't even have to go to class to do perfectly fine in the class. Your grade is based on weekly reading response papers (due in class on the readings for that day), a midterm proposal for the final paper, and the final paper that can be on any topic you want. He doesn't take attendance and there's no class participation grade.
Take this class if you don't want to have to do any of the readings (besides what's required to write the 2 page response papers), don't need to go to class, and don't care about having a good professor. 
The TA was awesome though, totally approachable, nice, and knowledgable.

Dr. Heller is a wonderful lab instructor and i disagree with all the negative reviews previously written. I look forward to bio lab every week because she is so kind and caring. She has a genuine love for biology which is evident in the way she looks out for all of her students to ensure we understand the experiments. She creates a very relaxed and chilled out environment in the lab which allows for casual conversation as well as stimulating discussions. Personally i have major problems with computers and statistical analysis but without hesitation she is willing to help. She doesn't expect your experiments to be flawless and understands if you mess up a bit. All around great experience and i'd recommend taking her section.

I highly recommend taking this course- whether you are majoring/concentrating in Psych or not. The material is applicable to everyday life, with especially significant implications for business, law, and policy. 
Professor Purdie-Vaughans is a fantastic lecturer who is both extremely organized as well as engaging. She assigns only necessary reading and makes a point to keep it minimal and the work level entirely doable. She also makes it very clear that her goal is just to help students learn, not to trip them up or create an impossible course. She actually means this. Often, she would consult the class on assignments, exam dates, etc. Whatever she said would be on the exam was on it- and nothing more. Extremely considerate and fair.
The TAs were all also very helpful, approachable, unpretentious, intelligent, and well-prepared when it came to answering questions and running review sessions. 
There is a required group project for the course. Since I hate group projects, this made me question whether I wanted to take the course. But the project can actually be a great learning experience and an opportunity to do actual research and visit a site related to a particular interest you select. Putting up with the typically frustrating group project aspects are, in my opinion, worth it for this.

The material for any poll sci intro course is bound to be somewhat dull, but do yourself a favor and don't make it worse by taking the class with Professor Blanchard if you can avoid it. 
His lectures are mostly him rambling and attempting to make jokes related to International Politics. The slides are eventually posted (with a bunch left out on purpose) near midterm/final time. He also insisted on passing around an attendance sheet before lecture though I'm not sure whether it mattered much or was ever really looked at. 
He assigns way more readings than necessary and buying the books is pretty much a waste of money. (You will need them for the essays though, so just check them out at the library). 
The whole course is pretty disorganized, and I finished it feeling like I learned absolutely nothing. 
The TAs were much better at explaining stuff than he was, so section was actually somewhat useful. 
Professor Blanchard is also super super vague about essays- how he wants them written, what exactly the question/topic even is, and this applies to essay questions on the midterm and final as well.

If you have to take this course, it's fine to take it with Professor Rakitin. It will not be a fascinating course that makes you want to learn more psych, but it also won't be the bane of your existence. 
He basically reads off slides that follow the book (with some slight modifications) and that are posted online beforehand. He can sometimes make funny comments that keep you awake but mostly goes through the material. The bright side is that the course is very organized with clear expectations. Since the slides are posted in full, there is not much of a need to always attend lecture either.

TAKE THIS CLASS WITH KATE. Especially the second semester.
She is the ideal Lit Hum professor- both extremely knowledgeable and accessible as well as great at generating class discussion. She always has excellent points to bring up about each text, including potential criticisms of it and implications for modern life. In fact, she makes a point of trying to connect the texts back to our own lives which I found refreshing since it can feel pretty pointless to go through the whole Lit Hum syllabus if it isn't being made relevant in some way. 
She makes sure everyone gets a chance to contribute during class discussions and raise their own points, never shutting down anyone's argument but also not letting people make sweeping generalizations or statements without supporting them. 
SERIOUSLY, by the end of the year she actually made me think a lot about my own life and the world I live in through the way she taught and had us engage in the texts which is beyond valuable. She also revised the syllabus so that we got to read some more modern and diverse writers. 
In terms of assignments, she is a fair grader (though not an easy one) and makes her expectations very clear. She provides tons of useful feedback and genuinely just wants to help you become a better writer, reader, student, etc. There are 3 essays, progressively longer and with more room for interpretation and creativity as each semester progresses. 
Kate is a fantastic professor who will teach you a lot, make you question many things, and create a sense of community in your class. She is friendly, intelligent, understanding, and generally amazing. So count your blessings if you are in her section and transfer into it if you can.

If possible, try to avoid taking this UWriting section. The course is already a waste of time, as it actually just makes writing way more complicated than it is by creating a whole UWriting dictionary of vague terms and ideas. 
While the readings that were assigned by Tana were interesting, she was not very good at generating discussion about them nor was she very good at clearly explaining all those vague UWriting terms. 
She was a harsh grader, something my entire class basically agreed on and was also vague about what she was looking for. Even though she would give us feedback on drafts, it would often not include the criticism that we would get on our final papers. What I mean is that she could criticize one thing in a draft, which you fix, but then in your final she mentions some other huge problem that she failed to note was a problem in her prior feedback. Meaning you can't really end up with the outcome you would hope for on any of the papers. 
Honestly, by the end of the semester I felt like my writing had gotten worse and like I had lost literally all interest in writing on even interesting research topics.
Since you have to deal with the waste of time that is UWriting, try to find a different section.

I'm glad I took this class, even just to realize I am not as interested in Philosophy and Gender Studies. Class was huge, over 100 ppl, and there was no space for any kind of discussion, unfortunately. So, basically, you get talk at for 3 month, any questions you have you can discuss with TA during their OH (once a week). Even though TA I had was wonderful and very helpful, the communication circuit constructed in this class was weird to me. Professor Mercer makes it a point to be a tough grader, so only small portion of the class will get As, and if you are just starting out you'll be set for a failure because you have to compete with kids who are finishing their undergrad in Philosophy and taking this as an elective. You have to be really good writer to get an A, reading all assignments and just doing your work is not enough, you have to be mezmorizing:) I know girls who barely skimmed though readings but got an A because they were better writers. I'm P/F this class because I had a lot of P/Fs left to use and didn't want a B. Readings are very interesting, well-selected, you should make sure you read them to get anything out of the class, because lectures are not always well structured, Mercer gets sidetracked a lot. I guess it would be fine, but then again she demands perfect structure in essays. If I were to do it again, I would just audit the class, I got more out of readings than lectures themselves.

Terryanne is simply lovely and this class was baller.  Who knew there were so many cool birds in New York City?  You'll take birdwatching trips during class and weekends and get some very digestible, usable information about urban ecology.  During other times you may be watching videos, listening to short bursts of lecture, listening to presentations by your peers, and doing lab activities like looking at different pine needles under microscopes.  I was impressed by how well the class integrated the study of birds, plants, and land use, with a strong focus on each but not at all disjointed.  There is more of a bird emphasis but the relation to plants and land use was very strong.
Workload:
Fairly light, but not a blow off because attendance is important and you can't save your efforts for a couple major assignments.  There are lots of small assignments like field journals, bird song id quizzes, and a group presentation about a peer-reviewed paper.  No one assignment worth more than 15%, many 1-3% assignments.  You have to submit summaries of the readings every week which is pretty annoying, but you could probably summarize them without doing them.

I should probably preface this by saying that this class was not on my list of preferred courses, so I already had some bias going in, but Professor Singh's class was a very frustrating experience. In the beginning of class we would waste so much time looking up somewhat-but-not-really relevant things online, allowing very little room to discuss the readings. I don't feel like I learned much from this class and I can't say that I enjoyed it. There wasn't much of a facilitated discussion, and I didn't feel like Professor Singh provided the necessary groundwork or questions to get discussions going. Yes, I'm walking out of this class with the ability to now say that I've read many famous Greek and Roman works, but not much else.

I took microeconomics with Ortoleva second semester last year, and overall it was an enjoyable experience. It was his first semester teaching, but he was a good lecturer and fairly engaging. His jokes were corny, but a nice touch to lecture. Most of his material is based off powerpoints, which he goes over in class. These powerpoints are all posted onto courseworks, which makes studying for the class very straightforward.
I found the class to be straightforward, as you knew exactly what was expected out of you. The first midterm was hard, but it was probably because he was new to teaching. The second midterm and final were straightforward and easy.

Yohann is the smallest most adorable French professor you will ever meet. He made class more interesting that it should have been, given the texts, and always brought about interesting points and sections to reread and analyze. His type of personality is one I wish to see more often in professors here on campus. He was very approachable and willing to compromise if something was not working out.
Some of the down sides: We moved extremely fast with the texts, often two or three book ahead of other classes. (one weekend, we had to read a book in its entirety). Also, if you don't like in-class debates where you go against another group of four while the rest of class stares at your waiting to rip you apart with questions you don't have the answer to, this section might not be for you.

Okay, bad joke out of the way, let me count the ways I loved this class. It was a thoughtful, and intellectually exciting examination of a genre of movie that everyone loves but maybe not enough people pay serious attention to.  I'll admit that when I registered, a part of me was like, okay, hey, why not, fun film class, we'll watch cool movies about gangsters; it was that, but it was also SO much more.
First, I didn't have much of a background in film beforehand, and none at all in the history of the mafia/organized crime, but Professor Pedatella found a way to discuss the movies/books that was in depth and fascinating, but also okay for someone like me who had no real background in the subject. Whether it was the history of the Mafia in America and Italy (which he seemed to know literally everything about), or gangster movies from the silent film era, or fiction/journalism about the mob, Pedatella had control over what we discussed but also left ample room for discussion.  Also, I was really amazed by the range of references he would bring to bare--I remember a pretty constant stream of references to Homer, Virgil, Aristotle, Nietzsche and also a lot of others that I'm forgetting now.  Sitting in class for three hours at a time would be really hard and boring in most classes; here, I was amazed by how fast the time always went by.
I'd recommend this class to anyone who's interested in film, organized crime, or even just the history of New York (a lot of the syllabus is set here).
