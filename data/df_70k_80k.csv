Alma Mora is the WORST professor I have had at Columbia thus far. Not only can she not speak English, she assigns absurd amounts of work. For example, a 28 minute video about art AND we weren't allowed to read from a script. None of the other Elementary Spanish II classes had to do this video. Her grading is crazy: I do not know one person in my class that ever got an A on any test or paper. STAY AWAY FROM HER. If you actually want to learn Spanish, Alma Mora is not the Professor for you. She can't relay information about tenses in a clear way, which is obviously unhelpful, and refuses to work with students (especially GS) who have jobs outside of school/ the class room. She claims that nothing is her fault, and thus blames her department for her miscommunication with her students or the intense work load she assigns us. If she actually wanted to help/teach her students, she would make an effort to meet with them and find the way that helps them learn best. She also is horrible at responding to emails, and on many occasions, I emailed her a few days in advance of a test or of a due date for a paper, and she never got back to me. In my personal opinion, a Professor should be sitting at the edge of their seat waiting for a student to ask for help. Alma Mora did not teach me an ounce of Spanish this whole semester, and instead, I turned to the internet to teach me because it was more reliable and responsive than her. Essentially, I am completely and utterly disappointed with the education I’ve received by Professor Mora, and the fact that the Spanish department has kept her as a Professor for so long.

She also assigns you exercises as everyone is leaving class and doesn't add it to the syllabus, so no one knows what she is saying and doesn't do what she asks. Then she takes points off everyone's participation because of her lack of initiative to put assignments on courseworks. Even if I did want to do the exercises and emailed her asking them, I would never know what they are because she never checks/responds to emails

Prof. Collins did a flipped classroom format this semester, and I learned more in this class than I've ever learned in any other upper level CS class. I enjoyed the class and I'd recommend it. I also wish that every CS professor would switch to flipped classroom.
Every week, he assigned about an hour and a half of video lectures from Coursera. These lectures are incredibly clear and the great thing about them being online is that you can watch them 80 times over until you understand the material. I usually space out during CS lectures, so this was invaluable for me. Then you attend a weekly (~10 people) discussion session where you do problems taken from previous exams. This was more like him handing out the questions, everyone staring blankly at them for a few minutes, and him explaining the answers. Repeat for an hour. These discussions were led by him and the TAs, and they usually felt awkward, but they were useful. They were supposed to be mandatory but he stopped taking UNIs after a few weeks, and I don't think they really ended up being mandatory. Toward the end of the semester, a lot of people stopped going. He posted textbook style notes about the lectures as well as classroom questions and solutions online after each week.
As someone whose programming skills were rusty and mediocre at best, I found the homework to be challenging but not at all impossible. I recommend using Python, and if you don't know it, it will be easy to learn. For the programming, you're literally just implementing the algorithms that you learned in class, so it's not so much thinking about how to solve the problems as it is deciding what data structures to use and being careful with your code. They were sometimes unusually time consuming though.
The TAs were usually pretty helping during office hours, and not as helpful on Piazza. Prof Collins did not hold office hours, and he explained that the flipped classroom would be the time for office hour questions.
Definitely come in with solid knowledge of probability. You'll need a little bit of calc and linear algebra toward the end. Which really means if (1) you can take a derivative, and (2) you know what a vector is and how to take a dot product, you'll be fine.

I found this course to be a major disappointment. While Gundogdu seems to be a very nice person, she is not the greatest professor. She assigned a seemingly random selection of works that gave an incomplete picture of basic political theory. The final third of the course hardly even covered political theory, but was instead focused primarily on feminist sociology. Additionally, Gundogdu's lectures were essentially summaries of the readings, making one or the other a completely unnecessary exercise. The only saving grace of this course was the T.A. who led the recitation. It wasn't even worth the easy A.

Prof Connor's class was very enjoyable. The field of Translation Studies is very new but he still manages to raise interesting issues throughout the semester. That being said I felt the class was kind of wishy-washy. I enjoyed it and thought it was a great class, and I don't regret taking it, but that being said, if you're looking for more practical, hands-on application, you might be a bit disappointed with this course. There is only one required translation assignment, though it is an option for the final. Given that it's a large lecture (100+ students) with only four TAs, it makes sense that there aren't many assignments. 
The lectures are often just Professor Connor discussing what he thought was important, and him trying (and sometimes failing) to solicit class participation. Sometimes certain readings were never discussed at all, though it is usually helpful to read them. Usually every week we'll have three or four readings (no more than 20 pages, usually they're very short) and Professor Connor will pick one or two and extensively discuss them. You may nor may not appreciate this approach. 
Even though Professor Connor runs a great class about an interesting topic, I felt his lecture style is pretty standard for a college course. His lectures aren't fabulously engaging though they are very informative. He tries his best to engage with students but he is very much the stereotypical ""ivory tower"" academic, and it comes across in his class. Most of what we do is dedicated to theory though I suppose his spring seminar on translation would be more dedicated to practice. I haven't taken it though, so I can't comment. 
All that being said he genuinely cares about us and he wants to see us do well. He calls us all aspiring translators (which I guess we are) and always has nice things to say about us, just for taking the class. He wants us to learn, and he seems to enjoy teaching, which is more than you can say for other professors at Barnard or Columbia. So all that said, if you have fulfilled the language requirement, you should definitely take this class. It is a very fun class in a subject that everyone is interested about since it really is everywhere nowadays. 
My TA was Valeria Luiselli. I am very glad to have been able to get her comments on my work. She was very approachable by email and after class, and very knowledgeable about the course material. She would also participate in the lecture with relevant information. All you could want from a TA. The other TAs were equally helpful, from what I could tell. 

Workload:
Participation and pop quizzes (15%) -- the easiest things ever. I felt the quizzes were more to ensure attendance than to ensure comprehension. We also had to post questions for guest speakers, which factored into the grade. There is an attendance policy (max two unexcused absences) though it is hardly ever taken. 
Language memoir (20%) -- very simple story about your bilingualism and how it developed. It's a very creative assignment, around 4 pages. 
Translation (20%) and Peer-Critique (10%) -- also simple. You pick a source text, which is about a page, and you translate it. You then send it to your partner and they critique it, and you critique theirs. You can pretty much pick any prose from the 20th century. 
Final Project (35%) -- 7-10 pages. You get to select from five prompts, and one of them is a translation project (which I did). You translate four pages of source material, and you can pick almost anything, even a poem. You then translate it and write prefatory notes. Altogether it came out to about nine pages. Other topics included: 1) discussion of community interpreting or subtitling/dubbing; 2) translation critique; 3) essay about a play (Brian Friel's Translations); or 4) an interview with a translator.

Sahar is FANTASTIC. She consistently explores each and every dimension of the text while covering the important bases. She never controlled the discussion completely, making sure the class organically came to its conclusions, but made sure those conclusions were important. Every class essentially started with some kernal, a quote, an adjective, some detail that would blow up into a larger theme that seamlessly connected to another. And Sahar would always be sure to organize information, list important themes and characters, and would encourage us to actually visualize the text. Some instructors focus on one theme (e.g. feminism) and spend a lot of time trying to uncover something unexpected, and some just focus on the usual, important topics. Sahar does both. But possibly the best part about her was that she was kickass person. She would always crack jokes and generally had a very kind presence in the classroom. Super approachable, super friendly, and super super office hours.
Workload-wise, she was wise with workload. The papers were manageable and she graded them a little harshly, but for the most part she was fair grader. And she is more than willing to discuss how to do better, although some people found that no matter what, they always received the same grade. But what did suck was that she occasionally gave out pop-quizzes which were the worst even though they're supposed to be icky (but if you do the reading then it's manageable). The midterm was tough, but fair as well. All-in-all challenging, but definitely not impossible.

Emily knows her stuff through and through, and lets it be known. This can be good (she can answer pretty much any question you throw at her) or bad (this seemed like a pretty demanding class). I had a pretty solid group, so the discussions were usually pretty interesting, but I wasn't too big of a fan of the small groups she's really fond of. The prompts she gives for essays are interesting, though the essays themselves are pretty tough, as are the grades. All in all, a solid class. Emily's a good professor, but certainly not what you're looking for if you want a straightforward CC class.

The class sounds interesting, and it says it will discuss contemporary issues in the American economy, like healthcare, housing, and all that. And it really does do that, but, as a 2000 level econ elective, it's kind of a surface-level treatment and I felt like I was a bit overprepared for the class because I read the NYT every day. It was pretty straightforward though, and not particularly hard. Professor Davidson is a decent lecturer, but the material wasn't too challenging so I felt myself zoning out a lot.

Little bit worried going into this class. I'm not a very big art person, and a first-year (I think?) teacher made me kinda nervous. That said, it was completely unwarranted. Joseph (Professor Ackley? I never really cleared up what his title was) was a killer teacher. He made art seem really engaging and understandable, and gave really interesting prompts that made you think about the material. The discussion was great in the class, and you could tell that he really had a passion 1) about art and 2) about helping us learn it. He was really great, a sweet, funny instructor who knows his stuff inside and out.

With all the negative reviews I think I'll come out and say that I *appreciate* Professor Wang. I don't *like* him - I don't think anybody likes him, and to be honest he doesn't give a shit about students either. He cracked exactly one joke during the semester, completely deadpan. 
Honestly I would not trust Vallancourt to teach this class. Professor Wang presents the material in a clear, systematic manner, and test problems are basically the same as homeworks with the numbers changed. Some of the material is difficult but gives you a solid background for future signal processing courses. I especially appreciated that proved all the theorems he presented. But be careful, it's not for nothing - the exams have proofs and you will probably be asked to prove Parseval's theorem at some point.
If you ever have a chance, look up the research he does too - he's an IEEE Fellow and gets millions of dollars of NSF funding.

Professor Morton is a great professor. Like others have said, his tests come entirely from lecture and he has made an app that is basically his lecture written down in an organized fashion. The class is definitely challenging - especially the second half where you memorize some 100 proteins. But you should 100% go to every lecture, because sometimes things written in his app are not covered in lecture, and therefore not necessary to learn. But again, reading the app is super helpful if you miss some things he says in lecture. 
All-in-all Morton is a really sweet person and will help you as much as you need. He will gladly make time for you outside of office hours if you need the extra help. He learns everyone's names immediately which I thought was insanely nice. I would recommend taking this class with him!

Everyone takes this class because its required, therefore Urban Studies Majors obviously HAVE to take it. I can honestly say I got very little or not nothing out of it. An insane amount of reading gets assigned weekly and as the weeks go on it becomes more and more obvious that NO ONE is doing the reading. Class assignments have basically nothing to do with the reading, which doesn't really make sense. Each week a ""new"" historical urban issue is studied, but they all seem to basically be a review of concepts of many of the Urban Studies ""A"" requirements. Prof. Linn might be better suited to teach high school because the way she structures the class has ZERO intellectual ""discovery"". She focuses on simply ""recalling"" the main points from the readings....asking what they said about x,y,z, which usually creates dead silence in the classsroom. She is also very opinionated and kinda rejects any challenges to her ideas. Oftentimes, a super politically charged statement slips from her mouth that doesn't really seem all that appropriate. Good-luck disagreeing with her, she will politely dismiss you and hold it against you. She does provide a lot of feedback on assignments, especially the final paper. But, I would suggest staying ""in the middle of the road"" on assignments. Don't try to be critical or challenge anything ever, because it seems like she just wants people to simply read the material and recite it back, just like a 9th grade Social Studies class. Her grading is very subjective and seems to have a wide range, favoring people that simply ""recite"" back on their assignments. She values ""looking at where research came, primary or secondary sources, etc and not any intellectual application of research. I'd probably suggest taking the class with a different professor if you're looking to get something out of the class. However, Prof.Linn's class is good if you want to stay in the ""middle of the road"" and never do the readings. 
Workload:
an ""academic"" book-review... reminds me of elementary school. Her favorites were people that talked about how great their books were and reported back the main arguments. A ""empirical data interpretation"" assignment... she gives you historical public crude death rates for various cities and asks you to create graphs and theorize the differences between cities... she asks you to do no research at all and use class assignments and readings to guide your theories, but people that were graded well CLEARLY did research.... people were upset because she was very critical of some people's ideas, suggesting their dates were off or ideas weren't historically correct, but they did exactly what she instructed us to do... and a final paper (15 to 20 pages). The final paper was the biggest assignment and you could pick your own topic in consultation with her. Again, I'd recommend doing something very ""middle of the road"" for the best grade.... just read a few books and report back exactly what you read lol

At first, I was pretty scared of Dr. McGuire. She comes off as intimidating. But once you get to know her and you settle in class more, you see how lovely she really is. She is super understanding if you need help on something or need an extension. She loves teaching and you can tell from her passion about the material. Her lectures are extremely well-organized and well planned to the dot (we never left late). However, she goes pretty fast! I would recommend taking notes on a computer in order to keep up. Her tests were long, but they were not actually that hard, even though it may seem like they will be - most of what was covered on the tests was explained word-by-word in lecture, which is why I recommend taking notes very quickly or recording the lecture to go back and fill in the gaps in your notes. Of course, that takes a great deal of memorization but I would say that's easier than a lot of other classes. 
I would recommend this class, because it's great to learn about the tropics - they have such a huge impact on us. And because McGuire is a great person. 
Workload:
Moderately heavy. There was an assignment due before every class, which was only 5 questions every time, but they were based on primary literature in the tropical ecology field, and these took a lot of time to read and understand. There is an 8 page essay/associated presentation on any conservation issue in the tropics - she grades that pretty easily though if you just follow instructions and don't look like a fool in your presentation lol. And lastly, 2 midterms and a final - all of which were cumulative (which came as a surprise a few days before the second midterm, because the midterms were claimed to be non-cumulative in the syllabus - so just ask her on the first day about it.)

Jon Snow is the nicest guy! He is so passionate about everything he teaches (obviously the most about bees since that is what he does research on). This class was very light compared to other labs at Barnard (see workload below). There were weekly proposals, but they were not graded difficulty - basically he just wants you to ask good questions at the end of proposals. The labs themselves almost never took the full 5 hours - we were usually out of there by 4pm. A lot of times Prof Snow would finish the last part of the labs for us (i.e. he wouldn't make us sit for 3 hours for the PCR to finish, he would take the samples out himself) which we all greatly appreciated. Sometimes he can be a little disorganized but if you have a question he is 100% available all the time over email, phone call, and office hours. He will answer everything and anything regarding lecture and assignments. Make sure you get a good lab partner because you're stuck with that person for the entire semester probably, and for the independent projects.

Calisi is a new professor, so she is kind of unorganized, even with her own TA to help her grade everything. She is nice, and her energy will lure you into the class as she is super bubbly and funny especially on the first day. Her midterms were not hard, but she gave multiple choice that had multiple answers, which always suck. Also, there is no curve, but usually the average is a B- to a B. The first test, we were allowed to get our grades changed in-person but she stopped doing that, saying it was too hard on her. That was fine, because we were allowed to hand-in written arguments if we wanted our grades changed. But she sent the class an email after reading the arguments saying if we studied more as much as the time put into written arguments we would've done just as well as the other animal behavior experts who got 100s. I thought remarks like that were silly and rude and over time they made me dislike her more and more - especially when most people at this school work their butts off. Anyways maybe she is just not for me but I know she annoyed a lot of people. I just don't think she knows how to write a test and her lectures come STRAIGHT from the textbook, which makes me wonder, why even have a professor? The one class that was not from the textbook was her own research, which she refused to upload her powerpoint for, saying she wanted it to be a research lecture like real scientists... Whatever...
On the bright side, things I appreciated from this class
1. she sent a survey out to get our thoughts on the class mid-semester and changed some things on her test, such as making us write only on 2 lines per question.
2. she gave us 5points automatically on the final exam because she was going to be gone.
3. she makes herself really available to talk to you if you need help
4. she tried to make lecture dynamic with videos

Some thoughts about this course, in no particular order:
1. Rocco is a stellar professor, well deserving of the gold nugget. He is excellent at distilling complicated subject matter in an intuitive manner. He cares about his students. If you ask a question during class, Rocco will make sure you understand it 100% before moving on. He never treats any question like a stupid question, and  completely lacks the condescending demeanor of so many profs. Amazingly, Rocco would personally answer many of my questions to the course email account, often within minutes. I'm actually amazed how much of a shit he gives about every single person in the class, given that almost none of us will continue in his field.
2. The course requires a lot of time. Every homework has 5 difficult proof based questions. You need to think things through very deeply. I was close to the top of the class and still spent around 20 hours for each homework. Some individual problems took me 5-10 hours of deliberate thought to break through on. This can be frustrating, but the reward when you finish is worth it. If you don't have much aptitude for theoretical CS, this class will punish you. 
3. Clement Cannone is a fantastic TA. 
4. As other reviewers have mentioned, this class will give you virtually no practical skills to apply in machine learning. That being said, it CLT is a beautiful field that will make you better understand some of the fundamental issues in ML. If you're the type of person who stays up at night wondering how things REALLY WORK, this is the course for you.
5. The final was very reasonable. If you payed attention in class and understand the concepts at a high level, you'll do well. It doesn't require anywhere near the intellectual sophistication of the homeworks, which is a good thing.
6. The project feels like annoying busy work, and is probably the only thing I'd criticize about the class structure. Reading a research paper is fun and all, but writing 10 pages at the end of the term with all the other finals going on seems like fluff. I think a 2-3 page summary would be better (perhaps for a smaller portion of the grade).
7. Out of the 3 profs who teach the core ML courses (Rocco, Jebara, Hsu), Rocco is BY FAR the best instructor. No contest.

This class is so much fun! Yes, that's right! Fun in a Math class!
And professor Woodbury just makes it even better.
It works like that: There is almost no lecture. Each class the students volunteer to solve the homework problems on the board. It doesn't matter if they have or not a perfect solution (in fact it's better when they don't). Then the class would comment the solution, discuss it and get to a better one together. Professor Woodbury would guide this discussion with questions and comments. Then, every week there would be a group homework where each student should do 2 of the problems that were presented that week (or small variations of them). These weekly homework had a more rigorous grading and needed to be typed in LaTeX. 
Sometimes, when we reached a part of the book with some very complicated concept or homework problems that were too hard, professor Woodbury would give us small lectures about that subject. His explanations were always very clear. Mike is a great professor, very approachable, not only during office hours but also by email and in the Coursework's discussion board. 
This model of class worked very well for me. However, it is time expendable, since there is homework due every single class (although the problem sets were not long, something around 5 problems per class). All in all, this is a class I really recommend, especially with this professor. :)

Easily the worst professor I've had at Columbia. She is an incredibly poor teacher who does not know how to convey information well. She writes terms on the board without explaining them and expects students to get something out of watching an opera for half of a class. The only reason I know anything (and it's not that much )about music from this class is because of the textbook, which she often contradicts. Also, in terms of finals and midterms, her fixation of definitions is insane. It's not only that she wants students to know over one hundred definitions but also she expects students to explain a simple concept in paragraph form. Finally, her thinking that students learn anything from a course blog is absurd. People just post whatever they want to do the required 10 blog posts. In sum, DO NOT take her as a professor.

However, prof Emir is nice person and easy grader. I think he just do not really care or does not know how to teach. I have learned nothing from the class. If you want to learn something, I recommend you to study by yourself or take other class.

A good, light, enjoyable introduction to the American Revolution. 
Prof. Haselby is nice, approachable and knowledgable. The class isn't tightly organized, but that's mostly intentional- Prof. Haselby always tried to keep students involved in discussions about the Revolution and its impact today. This often means 30 minute long Q&A sessions, so this isn't a class bursting at the seams with information, but that's just as well. 
The title is a bit misleading- the class spends a lot of time on the pre-colonial and early colonial period and ends with the Constitution ratification of 1787-1788. I also wouldn't be surprised if Prof. Haselby meant to cover more than he did. The history is well taught, with a lot of quotes and anecdotes sprinkled in. The strongest point of the class is a kind of ""myth busting""- Prof. Haselby loves to deconstruct some common misconceptions of the Revolution and to talk about its contemporary perception as a mythological event. This may be a little hard to follow for anyone who doesn't really know American political discourse, e.g. how the Founding Fathers are perceived and how the Constitution is treated. 
I should note that this class talks mostly about the ""bottom-up"" part of the Revolution, so this is not a great class to learn about the great figures of the period, with the possible exception of Washington and some Jefferson (through anecdotes and Jefferson's book). 
This is one of the lightest history courses I've taken, which for different people could be good or bad, but you should know that going in. Readings are light, there's no discussion section, the only paper is short and the two exams are straightforward. So this is not a class you want to take as a challenge or as some kind of total immersion experience. If you're a history major who likes to come out with a very deep knowledge of the material and to read a lot and write a lot, or if you already have a very good grasp of the history, this class might not be for you. But it is rather fun no matter how you slice it. 
Workload:
Reading: No more than ~70 pages a week and often substantially less. Nearly all secondary sources, with the two primary exceptions of Thomas Paine's ""Common Sense"" and Jefferson's ""Notes on the State of Virginia"". Pretty interesting material overall. 
No discussion section. 
Grading:
20% Reading quizzes- I can't imagine this actually counts for 20%, because we only did around 3 quizzes. But they were a good way of incentivizing reading when they did take place, and not difficult if you did the readings, which were short.
30% Midterm- standard to easy. Most of the IDs given in advance, essay question, both with choice, fairly graded.
30% Final- Actually more like a second midterm- it was 75 minutes long, same structure as the midterm, not cumulative, not difficult. 
20% Essay- The only writing in the course is a 5-7 paper. Yup. Critical reading of one of three books we read in class based on other readings and lectures, no outside research necessary.

Possibly the lightest, most relaxed class I've ever taken in the history department, and this was a seminar. 
Prof. Ridenti, visiting from Brazil, is incredibly nice, approachable and often comical. His English is just broken enough to be endearing, but it never really interferes with the class. When I emailed him with a paper topic, he replied with a list of possible sources, just like that. He also appears to be a generous grader, though I only have my own experience to go by. 
The seminar was essentially a small-group slide-based lecture with a good atmosphere. Prof. Ridenti claimed he wanted something like one hour of lecture and the rest for discussion, but it ended up being closer to ~90-100 minutes of lecture and 10-20 minutes for questions, which were mostly questions to the professor rather than inter-student discussion. The material was taught in an interesting and occasionally thought-provoking way, and Prof. Ridenti is excellent at presenting a balanced view and discussing multiple aspects of a fascinating period. He also inserts interesting historiographical comments sometimes. It would have been beneficial to know Portuguese and contemporary Brazilian society, but not at all necessary.  
The main thing to emphasize here is just how absurdly light this class is. Assignments involve one paper, as noted below, and even that is pretty limited. Readings are drawn from just a few sources, which are good for a broad grasp of the history but don't allow for much in-depth look at specific topics in the period. The readings are also entirely optional, given the lack of postings, discussion or any way of ensuring students actually read the texts. 
So if you want to learn about a fascinating period with a delightful and flexible professor and a ridiculously light workload, this is the class for you. If you relish the rigor and intensity of a typical book-a-week, intellectually challenging history seminar, you may be somewhat disappointed.

Prof. Hallak is great. Funny, with a slight Argentinian accent and a friendly demeanor, he liked to know everyone's name and involve the students in the class. Models were generally well-taught and Prof. Hallak was very approachable. 
The course is very model-heavy: the first half dealt with the Ricardian and Heckscher-Ohlin models, which served as a reference point for all later lectures, and the rest involved the specific factors model, tariffs (similar to what you do in Principles but a bit more rigorous), monopolistic competition and the feared Melitz model (brrr). The nice thing is that Prof. Hallak also likes to involve some more ""empirical"" learning, which mostly involves reading and discussing papers. This is a nice idea and made for some very good lecture moments, but it stalled sometimes unfortunately, and feels like something of a missed opportunity. 
The class is relatively light for the economics department- roughly semiweekly problem sets (6 in total, graded on check-check plus-check minus basis), which are pretty standard fare, plus a midterm and final, both of which were very reasonable and even on the easy side. 
I am a little ambivalent about what you can expect to take away from this class. The models are taught well, but they're models, so they don't add all that much to your understanding of the world. And while the empirical aspect of the course was a welcome departure from that trend, it didn't consist of much more than just going through articles. So the idea is good, but in the end the material to me seems rather forgettable, though it was largely an enjoyable experience. 
The TA, Goran, was excellent. Sometimes he tried to hard to demonstrate mathematically rigorous proofs and theorems, but he was very approachable, was great at explaining concepts and clearly cared a lot about his students. 
Workload:
25% midterm - very reasonable, a quantitative question with lots of hints and some multiple-choice questions (these were problematic because you could lose 9 points on a single question, but largely fair). 
40% final - similar to the midterm. Appeared almost deceptively easy (grades not in yet). Included an essay question. 
25% Problem Sets - reasonable, often easy aside from a couple sticky issues. Graded on a check/check plus/check minus basis, which was very surprising.

Professor Steichen is great! This was his first semester teaching Music Hum (and first semester teaching at Columbia), but he did an awesome job teaching it and is a really fair grader. His background (I believe a PhD in Musicology) in academia definitely showed in how much he is interested and cares about this subject (which I think can be difficult in a class full of non-music majors. He really catered to the fact that a lot of us in the class had little or no background in studying/analyzing music, in that he was flexible about paper and discussion topics and was totally okay with us incorporating perspectives from other disciplines in our analyses of music. He also gave us some super interesting readings that took psychoanalytic, disability studies, and feminist perspectives on the music we were discussing. This made the music material a lot more accessible to those of us with little background in the subject area. His past teaching experience (which I think was at Princeton) really showed -- he is always well-prepared for class and great at responding to emails. His class was an overall very valuable experience. Definitely take Music Hum with him if you can!!

None are better than Professor Adams who is a spectacular lecturer, very generous with his time, and a fair grader. Seriously, his lectures are not to be missed. The depth and breadth of his knowledge of the Victorian Era, one of the most fascinating in world history, are fathomless. I had him for two courses, History of the English Novel and Victorian Literature, and along with a wide array of literature including Dickens, Geo Eliot, Austen, Bronte, Hardy, Tennyson, Browning, we also covered social theory from Mill, Carlyle, Newman, and more.
Professor Adams is an Oxford Rhodes scholar who completed his undergrad at MIT, an absolutely brilliant man, whose generosity and sense of humor make him the best professor I've had at Columbia. He never once missed a class, and I've had several celebrated professors at CU who have missed plenty of classes. Professor Adams is a world-class scholar and anyone fortunate enough to take a class with him finishes the course having gained a new perspective on not only the Victorian Era, but all ages of history, including our own.

Professor Doubleday is a decent lecturer and makes himself readily available to his students.  He strikes me as having genuine passion for the material and wanting his students to do well.  He holds 3 review sessions during exam weeks in addition to office hours and private appointments.  He seems friendly and approachable in lecture, however, I found him to be surprisingly abrupt during office hours. 
His exams are straightforward for the most part.  He provides the previous 5 years of exams and borrows heavily from these (although I hear he may draw less from old exam questions going forward).  The final exam was more difficult than anticipated and the medians reflected this.  Generally you'll find one or two unexpected question types.   My approach was to master the practice exams and do the chapter problems twice.  
Medians on the midterm exams were ~90,~70,~70.  Medians on the final (which itself constitutes 3 midterms) were lower.  The class median this semester including all drops and adjustments was a 77, which curved to a B.  Above an 88 (and possibly a little less than an 88) should've gotten you an A.

Bottom line up front: This is an excellent class/professor combination. Highly recommended. 
The class pertains to chemical, biological, and physical oceanography. Basically, you're learning the ""whole ocean"" concept, which will change the way you think about the planet and her oceans. If you're looking for a class about dolphins and whales, this is not it, although those lifeforms are covered briefly during the biology portion. Prepare for some light chemistry (no assumed knowledge) and geology. The highlight of the class, if you take it during fall semester, is the open house at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. 
Professor Hoenisch is a world-renowned chemical oceanographer, but she's keen to the fact most students aren't 1) good at, or 2) interested in, highly complex chemistry problems, and also recognizes that those problems can be quite intimidating. She makes each lecture fun (buy a clicker) and interesting, and is always available for office hours and help with topics. TAs are geniuses in their respective studies, but the field is so large that they might (depending on who you get) have some difficulty explaining other sub-fields (e.g. if your TA is a paleo-oceanography specialist, they might not readily have all the answers for a meteorology problem). In any case, the Professor is available as much as any of the TAs, so it's not an issue. 
The class is highly challenging, enlightening, and fun, but you'll need to actually study and attend lectures.

Very challenging, thought-provoking, fun class. Should be called ""Intro to Philosophy of Science.""
Professor Albert is a world-renowned physicist, who basically sauntered into a philosophy department at some point and has no reservations about slipping into quantum and statistical mechanics at a brisk pace, nearly every class. That said, the guy is incredibly smart and funny, approachable, and seems to genuinely care about ""doing philosophy,"" rather than simply memorizing thinkers and their own ideas. So you can expect each class to be introduced to a very complex philosophic problem, then get pointed toward readings in order to supplement and expand the discussion. So, if you miss a lecture, you better go to office hours, or have a good friend in the class to bring you up to speed. The Professor has office hours regularly, and is very good about breaking problems down and re-explaining material. As well, he'll give you more sources to scour, or topic ideas for assignments. And if you're bored, you can check him out on YouTube, or in the New York Times. Word of caution: if you think you're well-versed in philosophy and are looking for an easy A, this is NOT the class. Professor Albert has no reservations about the Socratic method, and you will leave each class stunned by the material. Topics covered include Causal Closure Physicalism, Aesthetics, Time Travel (awesome), Probability, Laws of Nature, Philosophy of Mind, Ontology, Poetry, Ethics, and Physics.

I'd heard a lot of negative opinions about University Writing, but since everyone must take it, whattayagonnado?
This class will improve your writing exponentially. The syllabus is straightforward - read some literary articles, write some journals about them, come up with your own idea to enter the conversation, and write, write, write. That's going to be everyone's experience, regardless of the instructor. 
On to Harald Sundt: Wonderful human being. Hal showed a genuine interest in each class discussion. He was very gracious working with the ""class mind,"" and had a keen ability to ensure clarity on participative input before moving on. Having spoken with many students in other UniW classes, I can say that Hal is a gem. Understandably, the UniW instructors are grad students, each working on their respective studies, so they have to balance their instructor time with their own study, and I could see if you ended up with a selfish instructor, you'd be screwed. This is not Hal Sundt. 
Of course, the instructor should have frequent office hours, but Hal went above and beyond to ensure that each student was offered a personal coaching/editing session in addition to regular office hours, that coincided with each draft stage. By the time final drafts were due, each student should have been extraordinarily confident they had received enough guidance from the instructor to land a decent grade. 
Last thing: I had a fairly extensive background in writing prior to this course, but not this ""literary"" kind of writing. More so, I believe the course taught me more about reading, and how to disseminate and digest complex pieces, then develop my own opinion.

This is the worst professor I have ever had at Columbia. If you don't want to read the rest of this review just take away one thing: DO NOT ANY CLASS WITH MARIUSZ KOZAK.
Kozak does not teach. He makes the class read the textbook and we come to class and he says ""any questions? no? lets do some exercises."" He forces us to work in groups when its absolutely meaningless to, because you have to do a lot of figuring out yourself. You will learn NOTHING in this class because he's not doing this class to help you learn; he literally just wants you to work hard.
I approached him once asking why he took points off my assignment/tests and his response was literally... ""I... I can't give you an answer."" Seriously? You tell me my answer is wrong and you can't justify why your answer is right??
This class was a horror to take and every lesson was ridiculous and frustrating. Every class we would walk away feeling confused. Take my advice and NEVER take a class with this joke of a professor. You would have learnt more if you just read the textbook (it's not like we did anything more than that in his class, except he would confuse us more).

I found this class to be very interesting.  It took me a while to adjust to the lecture as Prof. Pemberton has somewhat of a softer voice and I found myself straining to hear him, even in the front row, at times.  His voice also tends to trail off at the end of sentences.  By the second half of the semester I was use to this and no longer found it as difficult to follow.  I was a bit disenchanted at the beginning because I found it difficult to follow exactly what the broader connection was, between the various readings, until the second half of the class.  Once everything began to blur together and the broader concepts emerged, I was completely in love with the lectures and readings. 
 The lectures are somewhat repetitive but in a good way as he does a great job of really cementing in the key points and themes.  The reading was altogether challenging. The first half, although less in volume, seemed to me to be a bit more heady and complex and somewhat more technical in ways with excerpts from Saussure's writings on linguistics, Marx's Commodity, Freud's Uncanny,  Mauss' The Gift, and readings from Durkheim and Boas.  I had a hard time connecting these readings at first and this made it somewhat tedious to get through them at times.  The second half we read one book per week.  Freud's Interpretation of Dreams, Claude Lévi-Strauss' Tristise Tropiques, Weber's The Protestant Ethic and Spirit of Capitalism, Foucault's Madness and Civilization and Stewart's Space on the Side of the Road.  These readings hooked me and brought everything else together.  However, it's a lot of reading.  
I was a bit disappointed that we did not do many class discussions, at least not during the first half, and we did no graded writing assignments, only two very short, ungraded assignments.  I would have enjoyed engaging with the material more via discussions or writing assignments. However, he goes over the key points plenty during lecture for anyone who pays attention and takes notes to be able to do well on the midterm.  The final was a take home, three essay question,10 page minimum,  which we had a little over a week to complete.  It was unlike any I've ever had, it was fun but daunting.  He basically asked that the student become one or more of the authors (3 essay questions) and engage with other authors about various concepts that we had discussed- part fiction, part ethnographic, I suppose.  
Overall I loved this class despite a rocky start and found Professor Pemberton to be a fair grader, a brilliantly profound academic and lecturer and, although he is clearly a busy man, I had no problem catching up with him for office hours.  We also had three TA's all were very nice and a pleasure.  They conducted two group sessions with refreshments, for the class to come together and ask questions and discuss the material.  By the end of this class I began to consider majoring in Anthropology and I was actually a bit sad that the class was ending.  
I'd recommend this class for students who are interested in Anthropology and/or enjoys reading the works of the great founders of social science / deep thinking, but not to someone who is just trying to find a filler class.

The few reviews provided below are a bit outdated so I will update with my experience of taking Prof. Wang for the first semester of Chinese (course for non-native speakers). Prof. Wang is incredibly nice, she is always in a good mood. That being said, it seems this statement is true of just about all of the Chinese professors at Columbia. Since I don't want to only repeat the praise of other reviewers, I will offer some negatives from my experience. 
She doesn't have regularly scheduled office hours. Her system is basically to post on courseworks (usually the night before) when she will be in her office for students to drop by with questions for her. There will be three slots of 15 minutes each, usually on two different days during the week, so about 6 sessions are available per week between her two Chinese classes. Once though she went two solid weeks without posting office hours so I e-mailed her directly asking if I could meet her with some questions. She never responded to my e-mail but about an hour later she made office hours available for a couple of hours straight on Friday of that week and then went another week or so without holding office hours.
Also, there were a number of times during the semester when you could tell she did not understand what the student was asking due to her lack of total fluency in English and a couple of times straight up said that she couldn't understand what the student meant by the question. Let me be clear, this is not a big enough issue to in any way significantly interfere with the learning experience overall, but it did happen. Also, she would often come in either right on time or just past the start time for the course and THEN start to write things on the board. At a place like Columbia, as expensive as it is, I feel like the least a language instructor can do is start teaching at the appointed time. Every minute is crucial in a class that meets 4 times a week and at the end of the semester even one minute off of learning per class will add up to the equivalent of missing an entire class. 
Why am I listing these complaints about a teacher who is overall very good and someone I would not discourage anyone from taking a class with? Because I want to impress on anyone reading this that at Columbia ALL of the teachers are excellent and will help you learn Chinese. The best thing you can do is enroll in the Chinese course with the fewest number of students that also fits your schedule, and preferably a teacher with regular office hours. Some teachers have office hours every day for an hour and there was one Chinese class this semester that had just 3 students in it. The more individual attention you can get from the instructor and the more you are forced to speak, the more you will improve. Best of luck!!

Oh man! Do not take!! The entirety of this semester included enough material for about three lectures. The reading list is huge, uneven, and hardly ever referenced in class. You don't need to go to class much or do the reading, except for her textbook, since the two examinations ask you to regurgitate her ideas precisely. It would be hard to dig further into the questions since they take the form of completely unexplained  prompts, ie ""Write an essay/analysis on inequality using the Cities book"" (real question from the final). The expectations are unclear, the TAs unenthusiastic, the curriculum lacking in any structure. Which is all a pity, because Sassen is clearly brilliant and the course material extremely interesting. You will be f*ing angry when you leave every lecture feeling like you were posed a really interesting question, and given no tools to answer it except for another summary of Sassen's thesis from the textbook and whatever was in today's Huffington Post. If you really care, buy her textbook and spend two hours skimming it. Then go take any other urban studies course.

I've been fortunate enough to have a series of great professors in the Chemistry Department. I'm happy to say I can add Professor Berne to this list. I thought by the end of it that I had a solid introduction to the discipline that is Physical Chemistry.
Pre-requisites: General Chemistry (of course). Although the course requires Physics I and II as pre-reqs, I don't feel as though we went beyond using F=ma. Calculus I,II,III are needed. There aren't many difficult integrations (except in Stat Mech) in the course however you should feel comfortable with partial derivatives as they are used frequently throughout the course. 
Course: Physical Chemistry I covers Thermodynamics, Kinetics, and some statistical mechanics. It begins by exploring whether or not a reaction will occur spontaneously and then moves into how fast a reaction will occur. Some of this is very reminiscent of general chemistry, only taken a step further and thus more in depth. The class concludes with statistical mechanics (partition functions, the canonical ensemble, etc.) and used to derive the equations used throughout the course. Overall, it was an enjoyable subject mater. I found myself saying ""this is cool"" and ""I love pchem"" throughout this course. 
Class (Professor Berne): Class was very useful to attend. Professor Berne was always enthusiastic about the material he was teaching and as a result I never really lost interest in the subject matter (he throws in humor periodically which i genuinely found funny). He is very clear with his notes on the board and goes at a reasonable pace. Furthermore, he would always make sure to answer any questions before moving on to the following topic. The only time I was at a complete loss was around Statistical Mechanics. It's more of a fault of the subject matter itself than Professor Berne as you really need to work out the math and derivations on your own to really understand it. This is when attending class is indispensable as I found that the lecture did a better job than the textbook when handling the subject. In regard to the reviews below, professor Berne only used power point maybe once in our class (understandably as the diagrams used would be heard to re-create by hand). He makes them available on coursework as a supplement rather than a required reading. Overall, Professor Berne is funny, concise, and excellent lecturer. 
Recitation (TA Matt Mayers): Best TA at Columbia, but I'll be brief. Matt took the time to type out ALL of the class notes and made them available to the students. His recitations were helpful in clearing up any confusion and as a result were worth attending. Definitely made PCHEM less painful than it probably should have been.
Midterm: Actually a Mid-Term. It covers all of thermodynamics (minus electrochem). The questions were related to assigned HW problems and topics covered in depth in lecture. Overall they were reasonable albeit a bit lengthy. 
No formula sheet. Probably one of the few things I disliked only because effort was put into memorizing them rather than being able to apply them. 
Final Exam: The final exam was split into two tests. Test 1 spanned the whole course. Test 2 covered material after the midterm only. Pretty long so you may want to focus on one test first rather than jumping from one to the other. See Workload for more info.
Workload:
HW: Professor Berne told us to take our book to lunch with us...he meant it. The assigned readings supplemented the material covered in lecture. If you read the chapters as he assigned them, you will get more out of the lecture. The assigned HW problems were useful and a great indicator of what was expected of you on exams.

I don't have much to add to what previous reviewers have said, but I'm posting this mostly to say, yes, Rocco Servedio is still (Fall 2014) just as great as he's apparently always been. He's the first professor I've had who is an articulate, charismatic lecturer AND teaches a genuinely interesting, deep and challenging course AND is passionate about his subject. I've had two out of three before (e.g. Jae Lee, charismatic and passionate, or Yannakakis, challenging and passionate) but Professor Servedio is in a class of his own.
My only complaint is that this is the only class he teaches. I'd take anything taught by him.

Professor Kim does a really good job with this class. If you have a decent CS background it shouldn't be too challenging -- you don't even have to go to class if you read the textbook, because she follows it very closely -- but it's pretty neat finding out what happens below the level of the level of C code. Professor Kim is a good lecturer and really good at explaining tricky concepts to the greener students.
If the class hadn't been at 10 AM (waaaay too early for this senior) I would've gone more often and likely gotten a lot out of it. When I did go, Professor Kim would mention neat factoids not covered on exams but still good to know, like (my favorite): Intel kept adding more stages to its pipeline in the '90s so it could ramp up its clock speed, and had to change its advertising strategy to deemphasize clock speed when it turned out fewer stages was optimal and clock speeds decelerated as a result.

Dr Carr is great! You can tell she genuinely enjoys teaching, cares about her students, and wants them to do well. Her seminar slides are so much clearer than the lecture slides, and it helps that they're organized according to key questions. She uploads them punctually every week, and I suggest looking over them just to see if you missed anything, and especially when you're making your cheat sheet. I also suggest going to office hours, even if you don't have any questions about the course material itself. I only started going towards the end of the semester, and wish I'd done it earlier. You can always talk to her about her research (some computational chemistry thing, which is actually pretty damn cool).
Seminar itself wasn't super exciting, although I think that's less her fault than the fact that most of the activities we had to do because whoever came up with the syllabus decided we had to were kind of meh in the first place. On the bright side, Dr Carr is nice and funny and interesting, which makes boring activities more bearable. You also get the impression that she really knows her shit. If neither of those appeals to you, seminar often ends (up to half an hour) early.
We had a quiz for each unit, which I found annoying at first, but it turned out that they weren't hard, and Dr Carr is very generous with partial credit. I skimmed the notes briefly just before every quiz and did fine. The quizzes do count in a tiny portion of your grade, but if you mess up on one she lets you earn extra credit to make it up. On hindsight, it was kind of nice to have a checkpoint for the unit, mainly because I am super lazy when it comes to consolidating my work, or maybe just for FroSci in general. She also holds a review session before each exam, but if you can't make it she puts the slides, practice questions and a study guide on Courseworks. All in all, I felt she really prepared us well for the exams.
There's also a term paper, but nothing to worry too much about. She's a pretty easy grader. Also, she gave us deadlines for the first draft and peer review, so you definitely won't be cranking it out from scratch the day of final submission - which will be around the annoying time at the end of the semester when everything is due. Trust me, you will be very grateful.
Workload:
Standard FroSci workload: weekly homework (which is actually graded, but as long as you don't completely bs it it should be fine); quiz for each unit; small assignments to prepare for seminar from time to time; term paper. Midterm and final, both of which you get to bring in a cheat sheet.

Traub founded the CS department at Columbia and has contributed quite a bit to the field of numerical algorithms. However, he's a bit senile these days.
This course was pretty light for a 4000 level CS class. We literally did nothing the first third of the semester. Traub just rambled on about super computers and Moore's Law for 2 weeks. The rest of the semester was ok, covering complexity theory for numerical algorithms, multi-dimensional integration, solving PDEs and solving arbitrary systems of non-linear equations. I learned a bit, but could definitely have learned way more if Traub made the class harder.
He assigns 12 HWs - each is either one programming assignment (definitely under 200 lines in any language) or a single problem/proof. He often makes multiple HWs due at the same time which is annoying. Most of the assignments were towards the end of the semester. Some of the Extra Credits involved reading papers and articles and writing short essays on Discrete Fourier Transform or Moore's Law which is really stupid for a CS class.
The midterm and final were pretty easy. If you pay attention in class and read your notes, it shouldn't be too hard to get close to a 100. Traub doesn't use a text book or post notes online, so make sure you take diligent notes - it's the only thing you can study from for the tests! Pay close attention to pros/cons of algorithms and definitions. He likes asking at least one or two of those on the exams.
He gives out an A+ to anyone who gets over 100% out of 106% in the class overall. The 6% is from the Extra credit assignments that everyone does just like normal HW.
Also, a shout out to our awesome TA, Polina. She brought an actual broad sword to class. It was pretty cool.
If you're in the Foundations track, you have to take this class. It's a stark departure from other killer classes in the track like ML, Algorithms and Complexity. However, if you're looking for a light CS class and want to learn how to discretize math problems and easily solve what math majors spend entire semesters on, this is the class for you.

Paul Blaer is an excellent professor. His lectures are generally very clear and straightforward. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you don't understand something, since he is very good at answering questions both in-class and through emails. Occasionally he'll tell a few stories about his research. Overall, a cool and funny guy who definitely deserves the nugget.
The learning curve might be a bit steep in the beginning (it wasn't too bad for me, but some of my peers thought it was), but once you can get over that initial hump everything works itself out. Just be sure to start early on the programming assignments or you will have a terrible time (no joke). In contrast to the 1004 TAs, it seemed that the 3134 TAs were more lenient on the style of the code - if the code works, you get a 100% regardless of how ugly your code looks.
TL;DR Excellent class. If you put in the work and pay attention in class, you will do well.

Sussan is a capable teacher. She runs this class like a standard lecture with PowerPoint slides. She is helpful and responds to emails generally quickly. The course material is not difficult, and the slides are posted on CourseWorks.
Towards the end of the semester, she has students sign up for discussions in which students form groups to discuss a certain topic. The group leader is in charge of leading the discussion and providing articles related to the topic for the group members to discuss. The group leader has to write a 5-6 page paper discussing the articles and the results of the discussion. Everyone else has to write a paragraph summarizing and analyzing the discussion of the day. All in all, everyone has to be a group leader at some point and everyone has to be part of a discussion quite a few times.
My only complaint is that sometimes, the wording of the exams are not very clear. Frequently, there will be repeated questions or jumbled answer choices or ambiguous wording. Sussan will clarify these ambiguities, though.
Overall, this was a very interesting class led by a competent teacher. Also not time-consuming at all. 
Workload:
Discussion Paper
Everyone has to participate in discussion groups for the last part of the semester. The paper consists of about five paragraphs, each one summarizing a discussion for a total of five discussions.

Shaw-Hwa Lo is not a very good professor. 
Pros:
- There is supposedly a large curve. The average grades on the midterms (69 and 62, respectively) are to be curved to a B/B+, apparently. 
- He posts lecture notes on CourseWorks
Cons:
- His English is not the greatest, so it's hard to understand him sometimes. He can be hard of hearing too.
- When he writes on the blackboard, the writing is nearly illegible and extremely tiny.
- He breezed through the last few chapters in the last week, which was bad because they are the most challenging ones. 
- He is not that great at explaining concepts. Sometimes he'll delve into theory and proofs even though there won't be any on the exams. That will take up time that could've been spent on working through additional problems.
Make sure you do your homework (try to do them without resorting to answer keys unless you've done your best already). The exams are very problem-oriented, so drill and kill on homework problems and examples, not on the theory. 
Also, the prerequisite for this course is ""Elementary Calculus,"" but be absolutely sure you know how to do double integrals (not covered in Calculus III) and find the determinant (basic matrices, Linear Algebra). They play a key role in the final chapters of the course.

The greatest thing about Patterson is that he is super enthusiastic about astronomy. You can tell he loves the subject, just from the fact that writes and performs songs about astronomy in class, or from his useful and entertaining lecture notes. 
The only problem with this course is that it isn't structured too well. Patterson will claim to send out problems sets today which won't be available until a week later. Sometimes, his lectures can be confusing as he jumps from one concept to another. The class did seem quite disorganized as a whole. It would probably help to read a little ahead so you can understand what he says in lecture.
Thankfully, though, he sends out lecture notes (although they are not exhaustive - you still have to go to class!) and shares cool news and events in astronomy. Once, he had a miniature party/get-together at his house, which was nice. 
As for mathematical background, you really only need to know Algebra. Be comfortable working with units and manipulating formulae (not too difficult).

What an amazing class. I will admit that Professor Mercer's can be a bit scattered and seemingly unorganized at times, but I came to realize while studying for the final how well everything fit together, and the reason her Power Points overlapped were to emphasize how everything we were learning was intertwined. I left the final exam feeling inspired, and actually enjoyed taking the test, which is not an easy thing for a professor to make happen. Professor Mercer is brilliant and bold, and has such an inspiring presence. This was my first semester at college, and it was such an amazing way to start it. I highly recommend this class!

   This class was interesting and very lenient in terms of homework. Unfortunately, and I am not exaggerating, you will have to teach yourself the material by reading the book and working on the homework assignments (which are not collected). Going to lecture is optional, for the most part. Professor Friesner provides an overview of each chapter and drops hints about what will or will not be tested.
   Lectures are, in a way, an overview of what you should have taught yourself. You cannot expect to learn the material at the lecture or even in recitation. Many of the formulas are long and involve 4-5 steps to complete, with missing variables at any step. Just because the Professor and TA's only briefly mention a topic/formula does not mean that it will not be a major part of the next exam/quiz.
   The quizzes and tests are usually an even mix of highly conceptual problems and involved computational problems. Some of the formulas that I was tested on were literally only mentioned once in lecture and recitation. The best way to succeed is to learn what kinds of computational problems you'll be tested on (usually assigned in the homework) and drill them in all their permutations. After you get good at them, the computational problems will be money in the bank for exams. For the conceptual parts, read the chapter early and let the concepts roll around in your head as you do the homework. Don't be afraid to use YouTube and Khan for some additional help.
   Recitation was the worst part of my week. Right off the bat, you have a 15 minute quiz, most of which are super stressful. The remaining 45 mins were simply not enough for the TA to review all of the lecture material. The Quizzes can be soul crushing, even if you studied hard. My class average, across all of them, was somewhere around a 65. Even though I knew there would be a curve, I definitely had a few long walks home after getting wrecked on a quiz. Expect it, it will happen to you.
   I would only recommend taking Gen Chem with Prof Friesner if you're a certified self starter. You'll have to teach yourself the course, flat out. I never went to office hours or attended a study group and got an A-. Just be aware that the material is highly conceptual and you'll have to know the formulas and concepts like the back of your hand.

Professor New's Class was extremely fair and predictable. I thought the questions were sometimes phrased a bit confusing but if there was a majority problem with particular questions, he would look into it and sometimes just get rid of it. He was really nice and he knows his material really well. If you go to class and study the book, it shouldn't be difficult to keep up.

I imagine this class would be very difficult to succeed in with no programming background.  I took AP Computer Science in high school, so I expected Cannon's class to be cake.  However, it still did require a good deal of effort and I felt appropriately challenged throughout the semester.  As past reviewers have mentioned, the learning curve is pretty steep, with problem set 1, and programming projects 2-4 being among the most stressful.  Cannon is not kidding when he says that the programming projects will require 10+ hours of work -- they really do!  Your best bet would be to start early on the projects and attend TA office hours whenever you hit a major rut.  
Lectures are helpful, but only as a brief summary of what you need to know.  To rely on lectures alone would leave you poorly prepared for the assignments in this class, but I think that for any technical class this goes without saying.  The two recommended textbooks are both very good resources and will be relied on heavily throughout the course.  I found that the lectures and problem sets were representative of exam content.  The programming projects, however, were not.  
The class is well organized, with a very clear outline of covered topics and assigned grading groups to expedite grading.  There is an entire army of TAs who rotate on a schedule to grade your problem sets/programming projects and who send you detailed grade reports VIA lionmail (more on the TAs later...).
Overall, I think the course does a good job at its ambitious task of introducing students to the fundamentals of computer science and programming in Java.  In addition, you will also be introduced to software like: Pico, CUnix, CyberDuck, Eclipse, Vagrant VirtualBox (maybe), and Gimp.  Professor Cannon has a good sense of humor and tries to make even the duller aspects of computer science interesting.  If you commit yourself to doing all the work, the takeaway is enormous.  My only major complaint:
THE TAs (well, some of them):
The TAs are a mixed lot.  Some are truly wonderful and are willing to help you with all your NullPointerExceptions, while others seem plain butthurt about losing points for inane reasons back when they were COMS W1004 students.  Between the 6 problem sets and 5 programming projects, you'll come into contact with at least 11 of the TAs.  
As I mentioned earlier, your grade reports are sent to your lionmail by your TA of the week.  Frequently, students will respond to the grade report emails to ask for suggestions or for a more detailed explanation of how to improve code.  As I have heard from other students, and as I have experienced myself, this sometimes results in the TAs correcting your grade to a lower score.  What I mean is this: when the TA sees your grade report again in your reply email, they might see that they made a mistake in grading you and then will lower your score by the appropriate amount.  
Until the TAs start grading things without error, or until some sort of ""grade-is-set-after-sending-to-student"" policy is put into place, you should not ask the TA who graded you for pointers.  I repeat DO NOT ASK THE TA WHO GRADED YOUR ASSIGNMENT ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENT--THEY MIGHT SPOT SOMETHING THEY DIDN'T TAKE OFF POINTS FOR AND THEN PROCEED TO TAKE OFF POINTS FOR IT.
To me this seems rather messed up.  Isn't the best person to learn from the professional who was paid to read through every line of your code?  As things currently are, it is impractical to talk to this person because they could easily spot a mistake in their grading and then make a last-minute change on CourseWorks.  In no other class I've ever taken in my academic career have assignment grades been so impermanent.  I overheard other students in the help room speak of ""avoiding"" the TA that graded their most recent assignment in fear that they could have points deducted.  I hate to think I could have done better in this class by NOT asking the person who graded my assignment for help...

I came in thinking this class might get a little dry at points, but it was actually pretty interesting the whole way through. Kosto did a great job of interspersing fun anecdotes and mini-activities (like simulating a medieval “ordeal” to determine whether or not someone was a witch in class) to illustrate the topics he was talking about, and his genuine passion for the subject he teaches was infectious and made me smile every time I came to class.
Kosto is the nicest guy and was helpful in office hours whenever I went. He was always open to questions during lecture, and made the class very non-intimidating for people who didn’t know much about the early Middle Ages.
The readings for the class were mercifully short, super useful, and (for the most part) pretty interesting. Kosto and our TA, Ethan, also did a great job of guiding us through the entire process of writing our term paper, implemented preliminary proposal deadlines and making themselves available to help with brainstorming topics and ideas in office hours.

Tina is an amazing professor. I was not looking forward to art hum that much, and certainly not any more excited about it after hearing other students' experiences with it. But, the way Tina taught the class made my experience fun and conducive to willful learning. She cared more about teaching her students how to understand and interpret the material than about meaningless regurgitation of dates and associations. I took so much more from her class than I expected to and I am truly grateful for that. Her tours of the Met and the MoMA were fantastic. Also, meeting her in office hours was a huge help to my understanding of the material and how to interpret it in my assignments.

Carol Rovane’s section was almost interminable and I always found myself looking at the clock to see how much longer I had to sit in class. Although I read every book for the class and took copious notes while reading, when I got to class, I would without fail be lost in her lecture by 10 minutes in.
Rovane’s idea of “discussion” meant literally zero discussion among us at all. Basically, the class structure was this: Rovane gave a long lecture on the topics discussed in the book at hand, then she (kind of) opened the floor for questions from us. What frustrated me the most is that every time someone asked a question or explained some reasoning they had about a subject, she would proceed to shoot it down and trump it with her own apparently higher reasoning abilities. There was really no interaction or passing of ideas between students at all.
Rovane is a very kind lady, but she was not all that helpful when I went to her for help. She also took an unbelievably long time to return our papers to us (I think her record was 6 weeks), which tended to be a problem when we wanted to gauge how we were doing in the class before, say, the midterm or the final.
The only great thing about Rovane’s section is that she cut down the readings A LOT, which helped us both to focus in on the important topics and to maintain our sanity in the class.

This was a great class. The texts, though extremely challenging and usually pretty long, were fascinating and gave me a new appreciation for both medieval and modern poetry. I usually came into each class having read the text assigned but having been completely lost while reading it, understanding nothing. But when Professor Johnson started lecturing, my mind was blown without fail. She pulled the coolest things out of every text that I hadn’t understood before that made me want to go home and reread all of them just so I could get more out of them.
Eleanor Johnson is by far the best professor I’ve ever had at Columbia. I went to her for help during office hours a few times and she was incredibly nice and helpful, working through ideas for papers and looking at pieces of drafts for me. She is really there to teach and make sure that you learn. After our first papers were not up to her standards (and her standards are very high), she spent half of a lecture teaching us about good writing skills (which was SO helpful), and then she let us turn in a revision of that paper if we got a B+ or lower on it. Her review session for the final walked us through exactly what we needed to know to ID all of the books, talk about their main themes, and compare/contrast them.
As a non-English major taking this class for fun, it was definitely a harder class than I anticipated, but it was still extremely rewarding.

This was a good class to take for my science requirement. Having already taken Science of Psych, I felt prepared enough to understand the general premise of most of what Dean was talking about. He tended to go really fast through material, but he was generally clear in his presentation of it. Some of the lectures were a little dry, but Dean always made an effort to include humorous slides and jokes in his presentations to make it a little more fun for us. His English accent also made everything infinitely better.
I didn’t do any of the readings from the textbook and didn’t find them necessary to do well in the class. Everyone was always surprised by how well they did on the midterms—on one of them, the average was 93%. So on the whole, not that much work at all in this class; just keeping up with the lectures and memorizing the material before the exams sufficed to get you a good grade.

Let's be honest, the Math department at Columbia is not that good. But, I can't say anything bad about Professor Gorskiy. His assignments were a bit of a pain, but I managed them thanks to the help room and Khan Academy. He was also helpful and straightforward with any questions in class and office hours. Most importantly, his mid terms and final had no surprises in them. He gave good review problems beforehand and examples in class. He also curves fairly and gave test results back very quickly (first midterm was back within 24 hours!). He reviews any homework problem you had questions on in class after the assignment was turned in, which I personally liked a lot. The book is truly terrible, so consulting him about the material is a huge help. Also, another thing I really appreciated in the class was his approach to trig; he goes over it a fair amount and does not test it very difficulty or expect you to know any beforehand. So, if trig is not your thing, don't worry too much here. He has a bit of an accent, but it wasn't to the point where I had trouble understanding anything he said. All in all, you really can't go wrong with this guy for a fair Calc I class. It's not a breeze, but it's far from impossible.

Music Hum with Ashley Nail was a dream. Ashley is an AMAZING teacher, and probably one of the best instructors I have ever had at Columbia, even being a grad student. She consistently made the class fun, both for people with extensive music experience and for people with none.
She really knows how to explain things in a way that make sense and in a way that you will remember and be able to talk about for years to come. She made sure all of us could make small contributions to the class discussions, and she introduced us to all sorts of cool music that was off the syllabus, as well, which was really neat. Her offbeat humor and cat lady jokes made waking up for 8:40 class totally worth it.
She did her lectures so well and also prepared us so explicitly for all of the assessments that if you kept up with the readings enough you could get great grades on all of the quizzes and papers. She also had all of the readings photocopied and put on Courseworks, so we didn’t even have to buy the textbook, which was great.
I’m so glad I got put in Ashley’s section. It was the greatest Music Hum experience I think I could have hoped for, and I would consider anyone who gets into it really lucky.

Professor Chiong is really great. The class I took started at 7:10 at night and I was afraid after having been in class all day that I would totally zone out during this one but professor Chiong made sure that didn't happen! She does an excellent job balancing lecture and discussion and always includes some interesting facts about the artist or piece. She really fosters a passion for art and has inspired me to visit more art museums! Definitely recommend taking this course with her.

This class was honestly a bit of a disappointment. I took it mostly for the chance to learn from de Bary (a world renowned expert on East Asian texts), but it turns out that de Bary himself doesn't do much teaching. There were two professors and a TA, each of whom were extremely knowledgable in their own ways, and yet students by and large ran the discussions. (I mean, it is a seminar, so student participation is to be expected and encouraged, but I would have liked to hear more from the experts in the room and less from kids who think that just because they took Lit Hum they're now qualified to compare everything to the Iliad.) So while there's certainly a lot to be said for the intangible intellectual value of sitting in a classroom with someone like de Bary, this class would have been more worthwhile if he had involved himself in discussions instead of just giving a brief intro spiel before each new text and then letting us take over.
The method of evaluation is also confusing and entirely non-transparent. All three instructors read and give comments on your papers (which is great) but they don't give you an actual mark, so you have no idea how you stand until you receive your final grade after the end of the semester. Apparently after your oral exam the three of them get together and come to a consensus on what you get. 
I liked Cavallo a lot—she was more approachable than de Bary and took charge more during the second half of the semester as we moved toward more Western texts. But on the whole she was also pretty hands-off during class.
All in all, this is a pretty good Globa Core option if you have a lot of time for reading and care about the texts. Having two professors and a TA present at all times is also pretty cool. But, if you actually want to learn new material, maybe take a lecture class instead.
Workload:
There's a ton of reading, sometimes two or more full texts per week. But it's okay if you can't get through it all, because you're never directly tested on any of it. 
Aside from the participation component, there are two 10–12-page papers and an oral exam with all three instructors at the end. The exam sounds scary but it's not really that bad, since you can steer the discussion toward the things you know best.

If you're reading this, you're probably already convinced of taking whatever Prof. Adams is offering because she offers really good courses and hey, it's an English class. You're probably just double-checking CULPA to make sure it won't be a total disaster. Read further; it will be. I'm speaking on Food Writing, but I think my warning will be universal. 
Don't let the optimism of the class' fun name tempt you-- this is far from the socioeconomically sensitive, culturally inclusive, tasteful course you might imagine Food Writing to be. The fact that it fulfills the 'American' requirement on the English major list indeed means it shuts out everything about food experience except those of white, rich suburban ladies who like to whisper disdainfully about the Food Network. It's what your cynic friends will think it is when you tell them what you're taking: McDonalds-shaming, fermented food-frotting elitism. The review from 2012 is still completely relevant. She gets her hands on classes that sound and have the potential to be great, and you'll be drawn into taking them. The syllabus and the readings might even sound good. It's friendly for bloggers, only held once a week, and great if you want to do a lot of writing and get a lot of feedback. But get ready for the most toxic seminar environment you can encounter at Columbia. 
Let me start with an example of how she's responded to students:
Student during writing workshop on another student's piece: ""You talked a lot about your family connections in the food industry in this piece, and I have to admit I felt a bit alienated by all the brands."" (not verbatim, basically what was said; I was only half-listening as it was the end of class and I was left exhausted as usual)
Professor (verbatim): ""Well, it sounds like you're jealous.""
No moderation whatsoever. No organization, no smiles, no rules. She sets up a Hunger Games competition among the students. You're free to make whatever kinda bullshit comment you want with little intervention; be as offensive as you please, and your fellow classmates will probably not have the chance to call you out. What fun! In the rare cases whereas the professor does interrupt, it's a put-down or quick switch of the subject (extremely unhealthy facilitation skills here). You've got pre-meds, English majors, Sociology majors, GS, BC, CC, your friend across the hall, whatever, a slew of perfectly nice students outside of FW suddenly forced to turn into monsterously bitchy, expert food and art connoisseurs who talk over one another to dominate space, time and available professor feedback. The environment and professor are horrible, so vulnerable attitudes among your classmates will become horrible too. Certainly the students who took Food Writing couldn't have been all bad, but the professor's condescension and bicker-mongering made for mean-spirited competitiveness to come out over every contentious topic. There is especially no use for this jousting when we're all writing a bunch of papers, not competing for preset test grades. How does one seriously argue about Food Writing topics, you ask? Well, this class was basically women in bad moods arguing whose experience was most relevant. Though you knew everyone was good at heart, there were a couple of severe problem people in the class who consistently made uncalled-for, aggressive comments and tangents. Nothing was done except for a few uncomfortable looks exchanged.
On top of the many papers and the blog that everyone crap-posts to (maybe a fourth of the class took it seriously and actually involved the readings in their responses) every week, as mentioned, you are required to throw a piece of your writing to the wolves at some point. There is fear like any other class that has workshops, but this time it's different. The activity is generally constructive in nature, but again, no moderation on the discussion. Feels like everyone is on the American Idol chopping block rather than a fun, relaxed celebration of one another's diversities and skills. People are basically encouraged to go Simon Cowell on your shit but will be 200% obvious that they have never read it to begin with. The ""real writers""/go-getters who actually do read the pieces tend to get even more brutal; it's hard to blame this on the professor but she certainly could have been preventative. 
Then you got the field trips. I really enjoyed these, but they took the life out of me for the first half of the semester--sincerely get a calendar and make sure you can get all the volunteering/trip dates in on the original occasion, otherwise your experience will be hell. Finding make-up opportunities sucked. Also, some of them you will have to pay for (for no good reason, you don't receive anything and still have to pay for your own transportation). 
I'm sure she's a good and fine person, just a bit inaccessible both as a teacher and a supporter. And it makes the class bad, so bad. Adams seems busy or something, always. This is a class that apparently nobody (including her) has enough time for. 
Take this (or any of her courses) if you got thick skin, can ignore 70% of your classmates (or drag a friend with you), can write, can stick up for yourself, and literally have no other options to fill your sched. Worth it for the easy scheduling but the courseload doesn't match.

Anton Zeitlin is a very nice professor. Although his Russian accent is quite heavy, it won't be too hard to understand him after 1 lecture or 2. He is always willing to explain the questions the students have. As for grading, he is very efficient so the grades will usually be online several hours after the test. He genuinely wants all his students to get good grades from the class so he said that if you did better on the final than on the midterms and the homework sets, he would use the final grade as your course grade. 
His tests are not hard: no killer questions or trick questions, everything on the test is covered in lecture and homework.

Professor Rojas is, hands down, the best teacher I have ever had in my life.  I had him for both orgo 1 and orgo 2, and I feel so blessed to have had him for a whole year.  First things first, he knew every single person’s name in a class of around 120 by studying the pictures on the courseworks roster.  He also holds office hours every single day, where you just go through homework questions and he teaches you helpful tips for solving the problems and for studying, so I would DEFINITELY recommend going at least once a week, more around exam times.  There is no textbook for this class, because Rojas writes all of his own problem sets and tests.  The way he writes the test is that if you go through all the notes from lecture and all the assignments, you don’t need to study anything additional, which proved to be true!  Before tests I just made review sheets for each reaction and redid all the assignments and I was fine! I got an A in orgo 1 and haven’t gotten my grade yet for orgo 2 but I did well on the tests and I feel good about the final.  
Plus, he is SO funny and tells lots of jokes, and also reads poetry and sings on a fairly regular basis, (he wore a turkey-hat on the class before thanksgiving).  
He started this video of the week thing during orgo 2, and he basically had videos made of him doing practice problems with the reactions we had just learned.  These were VERY helpful because sometimes when you go over so many reactions in lecture, it can be hard to understand how to do the problems.  
Overall this class is AMAZING!!!
Workload:
He posts assignments every night that are anywhere from 2-8 problems, but they aren't graded or collected, so you can do them at your own pace.  He also posts the solutions the next night, so it isnt a big deal if you can't figure out how to do the problems.  Other than that just going over notes and assignments is what you do to study for the test.  Plus the videos.
Don't be fooled, this class is very challenging and you will work incredibly hard, but Rojas manages to make it SO SO manageable and wants everyone to succeed.

This course was definitely one of the easiest I've taken. There's no textbook, only drafts from a book Prof. O'Flaherty is writing himself, which is written in simple, easy to read prose. 
I was disappointed because I felt that I didn't learn anything ""concrete"" from this course. Any facts we learned were either just results from empirical studies or seemed to be speculation. Also any math was basic arithmetic that we could have intuited without having to take the course, no new techniques. A basic understanding of game theory is helpful for some of the problem sets.
Prof. O'Flaherty at times says some questionable things about race in class and in his textbook, I have to say I wasn't entirely comfortable about the ways he put some things throughout the course.

I don't know if this course is better taught (if you can even say something like that) with professor Ibrahim Odeh or other instructor, but if you are planning on adding this class and Mr. Hart is the instructor, be advised that the money you are paying for Columbia is not going to be well spent. You won't learn anything new from this class, and even worse, you won't even have a CLASS.
Basically this course invites a different speaker every week to speak about a specific topic related to his or her field like foundations, leases, general contractors, tunnels or even about works from a company like Skanska. These speakers most of the time will take your precious time with boring things that you may learn directly from the book (and you will have to do so because of HW). I don't know how is with other professors, but I suppose it is all the same.
What is even worse is the way the midterm and the Final are conducted. Basically, both tests are 100 multiple choice tests where around 40 to 50 tests are EXACTLY THE SAME as the ones you will have already done for homework (as explained in workload) and sometimes he changes just one word or change the choices order.
The other 40 to 50 questions will be STUPID questions related to SPECIFIC NON USEFUL information that the speaker SAID during his presentation. For an example: ""How did Mr. XXX call the divers who worked with him in the project YYY?"" A) Plumbers B) Artists C) Clowns D) Carpenters E) None of the above

Fortunately I had 3 written HW and 4 Multiple choice HW. It can change depending on the semester or the instructor.

Echoing the review below, Ron's course is a breeze. He's sincerely dedicated to his powerpoints and providing as much information (from history to present day) on the pharma industry and its relationship with the FDA. Everything is quite accessible albeit tedious and repetitive. But he does that for a reason, catering to everyone from masters students, pre-professionals who've interned in biotech/pharma, and pre-med undergrads taking the class for shits and gigs.  
If you speak to him, you'll quickly realize he's a sweet and seasoned man. Ron's been in the industry for years, working for the likes of Pfizer and other pharma companies. I imagine he would write a stellar recommendation for those who put in some time getting to know him. 
On the downside, Ron could put everyone and anyone to sleep. Unless you pay attention to paying attention, you're at risk of falling asleep or browsing the internet far into its nether regions. A number of students didn't come to class until the final class/final assessment. They probably didn't get anything out of the class but still did well.

DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LEARN LINEAR ALGEBRA
(You can acquire the best reverse engineering skill though. Take this if this is what you want to learn)
All the comments below are true. You learn nothing from this class.
I am a junior and this was the worst class I've ever taken so far in Columbia. And trust me, I am a Stat-Math major and I've taken many other bad professors but he is the worst. Well true, Bayer does speak English very fluently and he is passionate, kind, etc etc. He is even genius in his research area. He's just not a good lecturer. As all the other reviewers mentioned, he doesn't teach any fundamentals of Linear Algebra. He only teaches methods to solve several questions in Linear Algebra. And what makes him worse than other math/stat professor is that he doesn't follow the textbook. You can't learn by yourself. You just pierce through the practice homework problems that Bayer uploads on the website and strive hard to figure out how to solve those question.
This course is an easy A, but you really learn NOTHING about linear algebra. So if you need to use linear algebra in upper courses, seriously don't take this course. As other review below mentioned, even if you get A from this course, you will fail in any other linear algebra courses. This explains everything.

Stochastic models is probably one of the most interesting topics you could learn but Ward manages to be such an incompetent teacher that this is essentially a self-study course. The class covers, Discrete and Continuous Time Markov Chains, Poisson and Exponential processes (not distributions - there's a big difference) in detail, Renewal Theory and Brownian motion. All very interesting topics that can be used to model a variety of scenarios and in general improve your understanding of probability.
The problem is not the material, but Ward. He doesn't follow a well-defined thought process, jumping around between topics, hastily scribbling something on the board and erasing it before we can comprehend what he's trying to do. Attending lecture was a total waste of time. He often admitted that he knew that we had no idea was going on but we should all read the notes posted online (beware - the notes for Renewal theory stink so learn it some other way).
The TAs go over HW solutions in recitation before they are due. They're a bit harder than what you see in the exam most of the time.
First midterm was ridiculously easy with a 91 median. Second midterm was ridiculously hard with a 56 median. Final was on the harder side since there's so much to study, but the median was in the high 70s I believe. I feel like his exams have gotten harder over time given previous years tests. He has a weird grading scheme detailed in other posts that you can find on his website.
All your learning is from the notes posted online, the textbook, the HWs and past sample exams. The material can be quite difficult sometimes, especially during the middle of the semester when you do CTMCs and renewal theory. 
Often, the TAs couldn't answer all our questions too, though I must admit that Mauro tried his best and spent a lot of time attempting to figure out stuff with students.
Overall, I'm glad I learned this stuff, but regret taking the class with Ward. He claims to be a generous grader, but he's really not.

Paul is a great guy whose enthusiasm both for teaching and the material is very obvious.  He moves through lecture at a pretty reasonable pace and often asks the class questions about what they think the next step in a proof might be, etc.  He is always well-prepared and very organized -- over the course of the semester he typed up 50 pages of notes (updated at least weekly) that detailed nearly everything done in class (complete with proofs, examples, and exercises) and these were enormously helpful.  That said, we covered a lot of material (I believe approximately Chapters 1-5, 8) in Munkres and I found the homework to be quite challenging, especially some of the Algebraic Topology at the end.  Overall, though this class was probably harder and more work than I'd expected after hearing people who'd taken it previously with other professors, it was very well done and Siegel is very helpful and responsive both via email and in office hours (where he will often go through the idea of the proofs of hw problems).

Course content is interesting but the knowledge and intrigue of the material is completely detracted and butchered by Professor Metcalfe's careless instruction and presentation efforts, not to mention her complete lack of course structure and organization. Her lecture slides have no rhyme or rhythm and each slide uses varying font type and size. There may be a sentence here and then two paragraphs there. In short, there is no continuity to her slides whatsoever. To make matters worse, her PowerPoint background is sometimes in black and font in white which makes viewing/discerning the print outs extremely difficult. Her methods are primitive and serve more as a learning hindrance than anything else. It is somewhat ironic that her course is names as such. 
However, if you are a dedicated and patient student, it is possible to excel in her course, but with extraneous effort.

Michael is a really good teacher, and made a great effort to engage us in conversation, both in large and smaller groups. He asked us at the start of the semester which topics we'd like to talk about, then followed through and came up with interesting activites for us for each one. I was impressed by how clearly he explained new concepts, and how enjoyable the class was (even when energy was low and no one really wanted to speak German).
I took this in conjunction with Intermediate German I, and speaking German in some context every day really improved my skills over the course of the semester. Grammar is not the focus of this class, and if you want every German sentence you create to have the correct word order, this won't help you.

I took this class on the strength of Professor Blackmar's CULPA reviews. I don't really agree with the raves about her lecturing...she talks in a kind of monotone with her eyes half closed. It's clear that she is extremely intelligent and knowledgeable about everything she talked about, but often it was very hard to pay attention in lecture. I will say that she's very invested in the course. She was open to questions and invited all students to talk to her personally about the course and assignments. She wrote up very detailed outlines of each lecture which were helpful in studying for the exams. She also read all of our research papers and gave a lot of comments, even though our TA's were the ones grading.
On the plus side, the readings for this course were really relevant and interesting. Weekly discussion posts really forced me to at least skim them every week, and I was glad I did. Our TA AJ was also excellent, and dicussion section shed light on most of the things I glazed over during class.

Professor Wennerlind is a fairly engaging lecturer. I was able to focus in his class pretty well and he obviously knows and communicates a lot about the topics we cover (especially the early history stuff). He also has a lot of cool/bloody/interesting anecdotes about specific economic developments.
However, I had a really hard time getting through the readings -- some were informative and enjoyable, but most were extremely heavy and long. Doing the readings is really not enforced during the semester, but you need to know a lot of details for the exams, so I (and a lot of the other students, I think) ended up reading everything in the span of the 3 days before the exam. Not the most effective way of learning. I'd recommend trying to do more readings during the semester, you'd probably get more out of the course in general.

I would agree with a lot of the reviews below - Khalidi is a good lecturer, and I feel that my knowledge of the Middle East is much expanded, though I admittedly was woefully uninformed before. 
The readings are valuable and interesting, but they are very broad and we practically never touch a primary source. The readings for the 20th century were quite unchronological, which got pretty confusing at times. Itwas kind of hard to work things through in discussion section because there was so much information in the readings for a single week (and my TA wasn't great at encouraging participation). I recognize that these are structural issues of a course spanning so many centuries though. 
Khalidi says at the beginning of the course that he's really not interested in grades/testing, and that's true. However, I think the TA's are unnecessarily harsh with grading on the extremely broad essay questions that constitute the midterm and final.

I didn't go to his office hours much, but he was really helpful going over exams. If you don't know why you lost points for something he will definitely help you out. I got allot more out of the lectures when I actually did the reading. Towards the end, I just didn't have the time (taking bio also) and spend much of the last few lectures writing things that made no sense to me, as I stared off into space and daydreamed. I don't think people in the pre-med program understand what ""No Curve"" means because everyone told me there is no curve but our class was curved. I think what they meant is that he doesn't normalize each exam score. You take 3 midterms and a final that is just 3 midterms (1 New/2 review of recent material) combined into one large exam. one of those 6 scores is dropped and you get a cumulative average of the other 5. Quizes are factored in if they help and we had good ta/bad ta quiz grading. (one was easier than the other) There was a very dramatic controversy in our class over an exam question, but Professor Doubleday's exam were very straightforward .  I highly recommend using organic chem as a second language, the Klein TEXTBOOK!!! and almost every exam question was similar to one of the McMurray HW Question. I found McMurray to be incomprehensible if I didn't read the Klein Chapter first.  Do lots of problems, if you want to prepare for this class before, get Weeks' pushing electrons and do it a few weeks before class starts. Overall it's fair, Doubleday will help you out, and I actually liked it much better than Gen Chem.
Workload:
It's allot of time: McMurray Problems, and reading. (I found the reading to be very hard in McMurray and wasted allot of time re-reading paragraphs that didn't seem like english to me-i started reading the paralell chapter in Klein first witchdefinitely lifted the fog for me). Focus on Mcmurray Problems-how to solve, and ESPECIALLY the PREVIOUS YEAR EXAMS he generously gives out on courseworks. Do well on all of the exams, get as many points as possible because our final's were low so they didn't help the cumulative average for us at all.

Very underwhelming class. I chose to take CS Theory with Aho due to his fame...in hindsight, this was a bad decision for me. I'm sure there are other people who feel differently, but this was my experience:
Lectures- Aho seems to think that the material is a lot easier than it actually is, often failing to adequately explain simpler concepts in favor of complex proofs, etc. that never appeared on homeworks or exams. This is probably due to the fact that he pretty much invented a lot of it; however, for most of us, this was our first experience with theoretical computer science.
Aho also just plainly isn't an engaging lecturer. Listening to him lecture is a lot like listening to your great-uncle drone on about the Great Buckwheat Shortage of '68 (if your great-uncle is a great storyteller, then ignore this). Occasionally, Aho will talk about having dinner with Stephen Wolfram or working with Kernighan and Ritchie at Bell Labs, which is always cool but doesn't necessarily make the class worth taking.
Homeworks- hard, but doable. There were five problems per problem set. They were problems that you had to do out and solve, which turned out to be useless because:
Exams- both the midterm and final were 10 true/false questions (with brief explanation). I just don't understand how ten true/false questions can adequately assess your knowledge of CS Theory. For the midterm, I studied all the algorithms and the workings of automata, but I did poorly on the exam (far below average). Many of the T/F questions were tricky (average was a 45, std. dev. of 22).
For the final, I didn't bother to learn how to solve any problems or do any proofs, because I knew they weren't going to be on the exam. Didn't really know much about Turing Machines. Bad mindset, I know, but I just studied the general concepts and did much better than the class average (which was a 75).
In conclusion- my recommendation? Take this class with someone else. I was not impressed...I'm not trying to be disrespectful towards Aho, but he is a professor that should be known for his accomplishments, not his teaching ability. Apparently he got a Great Teacher Award from Columbia at some point, but I feel like that has a lot to do with his legacy. I dunno, someone might come along and say something different, but I found the class dull and uninspirational.

Great teacher, probably my favorite this semester. He's a good guy and cares a lot about the material. Class was pretty engaging, and he knew a lot of interesting tidbits about the works of art. If you get him, don't switch out!

Before taking this class I read all of the reviews on Professor Fleischer, and a lot of it is true. However, a lot of people are overly harsh due to the fact that Fleischer is a tough grader. Yes, a lot of people get a B or lower on their first essay, but it is very easy to do better. Like a lot of english teachers, she has her own opinions and grades accordingly. I am not condoning this but, since it is apparent in her class, there is no reason to try and go against her comments on your paper. 
Also, one of the most helpful thing is GO TO HER OFFICE HOURS. Many people do not take advantage of this and, as a result, don't do as well as they might hope. If you're not willing to put in the time, then of course you won't see it in the results. Also, especially for her class, go to the writing center!! They can help with grammatical errors that Fleischer might not comment on in the first draft, as well as they can help redirect your essay if Fleischer basically tells you to rewrite it (Which will happen at least once). 
She also gives extra credit points for participation. As long as you read the given readings it is really not hard to talk once or twice during a class period and get points- considering each is lead by a student and questions are given to start conversation.
I also believe her essay system is great. You hand in your first draft to her and she hands it back with her thoughts on it. Then you rewrite it with an outline and have a peer review. *****If you do the peer review well she also gives you extra credit***** ( so do them well because they actually do boost your grade). She reads the outline AND AGAIN gives comments, which is very generous. Then you write it a third time and that is the one you hand in. She gives you a week between each draft- giving you many changes to go to her office hours, writing center, etc. Again, very generous.
Honestly, if you're willing to listen to her criticism and ideas on your essay, then you will do fine. I enjoyed her class because I thought that she had some great ideas, and if you're willing to overlook the fact that she may give you a bad grade, she may not be that terrible of an academic teacher. We go to an academically challenging school and she is an academically challenging teacher.

I fail to understand the negative reviews about Dr. Traub, although granted I'm reviewing a different class than the
others here. I suppose there must be a huge difference between them.
I found the lectures to be quite engaging. He makes a strong effort to get students to participate in the class and
goes of on interesting tangents. I was rarely bored in class. Many people found the class to be quite easy, but others 
found it to be difficult. I never saw it plotted, but I suspect there was a bimodal distribution on the exam curves. 
Unless you are comfortable with non-discrete mathematics, you are likely to struggle in this class. Despite my strong 
background, there were still a few rare lectures where I had to focus really hard to follow him. Even then, I don't think
I really understood the material until doing the homeworks or studying for the exams. My suggested prerequisites:
1. You need to have taken Calc I and at least remember how to differentiate and integrate.
2. Know about differential equations. If you haven't taken it before, read the first two chapters of some introductory
book, do a few problems, and that should be good enough.
3. You need some notion of set theory, functional analysis, or some high order math. No need to take those courses, 
but if you can vaguely follow the wikipedia pages, you are good to go.
4. You better have precalc down or you're going to have a bad time.
Discrete math, probability, and graph theory won't help you in this class.
Most of the homeworks are quite easy, and can be done in 3hrs or less even if you aren't paying attention. No proof
is more complicated than simple algebraic manipulation, and the programs you write are spelled out in the
handout (in pseudocode) and easy to reproduce in any reasonable language you chose. I was able to implement many of the
algorithms without understanding what I was doing at the time. Oh and don't even think about skipping lectures, much
less not paying attention without recording it or something. The homeworks are almost impossible to do without learning
from the lecture. But if you do, they turn out to be quite easy.
The exams basically test if you did the homework and paid attention in lecture. Some questions were easy enough to
insult your intelligence, and others were intentionally harder to prevent a large fraction of students from getting
100%.
It's probably the easiest CS class I have taken at Columbia. However, most of the material was quite
unfamiliar to me at first (seriously, who studies algorithms for differential equations?) but I felt like a grasped
most of it pretty well at the end. I wish the class had a bit more breadth in it, but I'm glad it wasn't like those
other CS classes that dump so much material on you that you have to pick and choose what you are going to learn and
cross your fingers that the other topics won't appear on the tests. I think Dr. Traub struck a perfect balance of theory
and application in the class. Overall, I recommend this class. 
Seriously, if you have enough self-discipline, learn regular algorithms (4231) on coursera and save your money. The content is
the same. Take this class instead because you probably won't get an opportunity to see this material elsewhere and this
class is less stressful (yes, I've taken both). 
Workload:
Pretty typical: 40% final, 30% midterm, 30% hw, 6% extra credit hw. All are easy if you understand the material. Time commitment is certainly below average, but never skip lecture.

I’m a senior majoring in biology, and never until now have I wanted to write a review of a professor.  Professor Carlebach’s class was by far the best I have ever taken at Columbia and it has made me regret, at multiple times, not majoring in history. She teaches the class with such passion, and lectures like she’s telling a fascinating story. Medieval Jewish studies is not just about the Jews; it’s about the different societies they live in and the people they interact with.  (It’s a history class, not a religion class, so you definitely don’t have to be Jewish to do well). Professor Carlebach keeps her lectures anything but boring by frequently incorporating art and other primary sources to help demonstrate the culture of the time periods. Similarly, many of the readings for homework are primary sources as well. Though one can get by only partially doing the readings, Professor Carlebach assigns a very manageable amount compared to other global cores, and I never missed the readings because they were that relevant and interesting. 
Professor Carlebach is such a sweet woman and she has no desire to make this class stressful. Her exams are very fair; they consist of about 8-10 broad questions (1 you can skip) that you provide about a page written response to. The final paper was really flexible; we were allowed to choose any primary source from the time periods we learned about and write about that subject matter in more detail. I had a lot of fun writing it because I could pick something that interested me.
Take this class! Not only is it a very low-stress global core, but having Professor Carlebach is a huge treat! 

Workload:
Very low stress compared to other global cores. Final paper 10-12 pages on a topic of your choice. 80-100 pages of very interesting reading per week. Weekly 50 min recitation to go over reading and course material. Fair midterm and final with broad short answer questions.

Radev's a jovial guy and a decent teacher. However, I didn't learn much in this class since Radev focused a lot on useless topics. We literally spent 60% of the class studying logic of some sort. I would rather have learned more about search algorithms and machine learning. Radev coached the International Linguistics Olympiad team so he's a big fan of linguistics and it shows in his teaching. He spent a lot of time talking about gramamars and outlining NLP at a highly impractical level which I really hated. I think you can learn more about AI by taking a MOOC online from Coursera or Udacity.
There are 4 programming projects which are all very time consuming. He gives you 2 weeks for each and they take at least 6-8 hrs. There's no upper limit since you can improve the assignments as much as you want in an effort to get the very generous extra credit (up to 20 points on a 100 point assignment that counts for 20% of your grade). Only 2 of the projects had anything to do with AI. The first one was to be coded in LISP which has the dumbest syntax ever - it's like a poor man's Haskell with a lot of parenthesis.
All in all, can't recommend taking this class since it doesn't really cover much. Radev's a nice guy and probably the best teacher for AI you're going to find but the class itself is pointless.
Tests are ok. If you read all the slides you should be fine. If you understand all the algorithms and definitions, you'll do great - there aren't any questions that require a lot of thinking and being clever. He just test how well you know the material. Be warned that some of the slides kind of stink in which case you might want to refer the textbook. Don't waste time reading the entire textbook like he asks you to - it's just a scape goat for him to ask you anything he wants and for you to not complain that it wasn't covered.
Grading was decently generous. He added points on the midterm and final since the average wasn't as high as he wanted.

Stay away from Edwards, go with Aho. Edwards recommends Aho himself. Also, Aho's famous because he's the A in AWK and wrote the Dragon book. The only thing you'll miss in Aho's class is Edwards' sense of humor.
Edwards is the snarkiest, most sarcastic, immature professor you will meet in the CS department. He tells some really great nerdy jokes and his Facebook wall is hilarious since he belittles all his students publicly on it, but I don't recommend taking his class. Don't ever email him with an excuse or stupid question since he will publicly shame you (name removed though) on Facebook.
I didn't learn much in the course. The material was pretty straight forward, nothing really complicated like you would see in more theoretical CS classes. You sort of get a high level understanding of how a compiler works and that's about it. If you did most of the work for your project, you will learn more mostly by reading on your own to save your project and not because you learned anything from this class. 
His exams are reasonably easy but the problem is everyone gets high scores. The median on the midterm was like a 94. If you screwed up even a little bit, you were done for. You don't have to know all the material in the slides - most of it is to build the compiler. He posts review slides the class before the exam. You just need to know the stuff on them. Check out the last semester slides on his website to peek ahead. Grading was harsh and he often cuts points for really dumb reasons. Make sure your HW is perfect if you want a good score.
The project is KILLER. In all likelihood, you will fail if you don't assemble the Avengers to be your team. Make sure you put together a strong team which has time to commit to this project. The project is structured such that one person (the most responsible or the least busy) always ends up doing over 50% of the work. We've looked at other groups and previous teams and this is the case through out. I think Edwards should take a look at this and somehow fix the project so that it's more fair.
Some tips: Start early!!! Get the scanner and parser out of the way quickly. You can copy most of them from last year's groups and just modify them to your liking. He doesn't really teach you enough to write the compiler till 3/4ths of the way into the semester but don't wait for that since you'll get screwed. Semantic checking and code generation take a ton of time to complete. Start early and be sure to pester the TAs for help. Also, half of you team will be slackers and you will lose all faith in humanity. You just have to deal with it.
He doesn't make expectations on the project clear at all, so I'm going to break it down for you here. You need to turn in your proposal 2-3 weeks into class. Get started with the scanner and parser ASAP. Then turn in your language reference manual which says what your language will look like. Then code up the rest of your compiler and put together some tests. Our group ended up writing 70% of our language during reading week and finishing the slides for our final presentation and the project report during finals week. Needless to say, my other exams got screwed in the process.

Let me preface this review by saying that I am a Biochemistry major and have not yet received my final grade for this 5 credit course so everything I'm saying is as unbiased as can be. 
While the course offered many opportunities to learn biochemistry lab techniques and truly discover the beauty of each technique and its usefulness, this course failed to truly allow students to grow as individual biochemists and progress forward through the semester. Why, you may ask? Because, Professor Sever though knowledgeable about the course material, was unbelievably unprofessional in her INABILITY to RETURN STUDENT LAB REPORTS ON TIME!!!!!!!!
I (along with everyone else) handed in our very first lab report on September 9th, 2014 and did not get the grade or comments on it back until December 9th, 2014!!!! That's 3 MONTHS later. Basically as the semester progressed, we were handing in lab reports one after the other with NO PRIOR FEEDBACK from past lab reports. 
NO FEEDBACK meant that it was impossible for students to improve, see growth or have a sound sense of where they were in the class. 
While most Barnard/Columbia professors generally seem to be unconcerned about grades, they need to realize that grades matter to students... especially when we are talking about a 5 credit class! 5 CREDITS! 
As I'm writing this, it is the morning of December 25th, and I've only received 3 lab reports out of 7 back!
This is preposterous! I am really disappointed with how this course was so poorly executed.
Kudos to the Lab Assistant/Instructor, Dr. Liu, though; she is phenomenal (I would have preferred if she taught the class).

Professor Rokkanen certainly has good intentions, but his section was not effective in conveying the material.
Granted, this was his first semester teaching W3412, and the course will probably change in the future if he happens to teach it again, so take my review with a grain of salt.
For clarity's sake, let me separate the professor from the course itself.
-----
As a lecturer, Rokkanen is enthusiastic but oftentimes unclear. He does occasionally joke about his spoken English, but this really isn't a problem. The problem comes when he's trying -- and believe me, he's trying very earnestly -- to explain the intuition behind the methods. I personally found his explanations unhelpful, as they didn't so much provide intuition as rephrase what was on the slide with less jargon (case in point: his lecture on IV estimation). What that means is you'll probably have to read the Stock-Watson textbook a good amount, or be prepared to google a lot, if you want to hone your intuition, which really is the whole point of introductory metrics.
His lecture slides are structured, organized, and overall decent, although I would recommend taking a look at Arkonac's slides, which tended to be less organized but provided more intuition. Remember: intuition is key and the ultimate goal of this course.
Onto the course itself, e.g. the homework, the exams, the pacing, etc.
It was odd -- and by odd I mean unfortunate -- that all of our problem sets and exams were borrowed from Arkonac's course. Practically speaking, I felt like we were less prepared in completing the problem sets than students from Arkonac's section. Each professor allocates their lecture time on different topics differently, and it was frustrating having to search for a derivation that was absent from his slides (incidentally, they were often included in Arkonac's). There are tons of reviews on Arkonac's problem sets, but let me add a few comments.
The homework is long and tedious. Watching anyone hunched over their computer, filling out those dreaded tables while simultaneously trying to use STATA is a sad sight to behold. For the average student, I'd estimate them to take roughly 4-8 hours to complete. It sucks, it really does. True/False can be tricky, and grading is not especially vicious, but it's easy to lose points if you answer a question incorrectly... well, no sh*t. My advice is plain and simple: suck it up. The exams test you on concepts similar to what was on the problem sets, and the hours of completing them will help internalize what you can probably expect to show up at least somewhere on the midterm/final. The feeling in your stomach (believe me, it's not a good feeling) when you're working on the exam is the same feeling you get when you're working on the problem set. Do the homework.
A few last remarks on the curriculum. For those of you with no background in linear regression, there's a ton of material that is covered in this course, and 100% of it is predicated on the mutual understanding between the department and yourself that you're up-to-speed on basic probability and statistics. Know what conditional probability is. Know what an estimator is, really. It's nothing too advanced, but coming in with poor preparation can cause you much more trouble along the way.
Would I recommend? I would recommend Rokkanen for introductory metrics if his problem sets and exams are, in the future, tailored to his own lectures and expectations. If not, choose Arkonac.
Workload:
More than I expected. Problem sets are painful and will eat up *at least* one full weekend night. Reading the textbook / other forms of building intuition may add another two hours.
Double that time for those who don't know how to calculate the expected value of a discrete random variable.

Fantastic professor who bothered to learn everybody's name, which is rare in a lecture setting. Lectures were well organised and informative. 
The first third of the class overlaps with History of Modern China I, but unlike the other class, there is greater focus on reading primary and secondary sources in translation. The required postings can be a bit of drag, but the readings are generally interesting. 
I felt I learnt a lot about Chinese history in this class, though it seems to cut off just as Deng Xiaoping takes power so there's not a lot on post-Cultural Revolution China.

Disclaimer: I did okay in the class so I have no reason to write a biased review.
Friesner is a pretty shitty lecturer. As a matter of fact he reads right off his slides which makes going to class kind of pointless. His exams tend to contain awkwardly worded questions which at times make you feel like you're being tested on comprehension rather than the material itself. Also, his TA this year loved making ridiculously tough quizzes. He was a really nice guy but I think he expected a little too much out of someone who was encountering the material for an intro level course. That being said, if you are a self studier and one of those people who can read the book and show up for exams, this class may not be as bad for you. The curve tends to be nicer since his exams averages are pretty low compared to other chem sections. Some of his exam questions are directly off the slides so definitely read the slides after reading the textbook. Overall, I would say take this class if you are a good independent studier and NOT if you learn the most from going to lecture.
Workload:
Depends on your study habits. I would just keep up with the chapter being taught in lecture. You have to anyway since there are weekly quizzes. Other than that, I would give myself full 2 days before an exam to go over problems and his practice exam.

So keep in mind that this is a Calc class so don't expect it to be inspiring in anyway. Like any other math class: dry, straightforward, hard, and time consuming if you are aiming for an A. Hom is very straightforward and basically copies down the book on the board while explaining the concepts. This is all I need from a professor so lectures were very helpful to me. The class is boring and you feel like %90 of material are useless, especially if you are an Econ major.
The HW is from the textbook, nothing crazy, and if you are stuck she will walk you through the problem in her office hours. There are usually 2-3 people in her office so you never have to wait that long for your turn which is rare in other classes. They are usually graded within a week. Make sure you do the problems yourself as they are crucial in getting a good grade 19.5/20
First midterm: It was nightmare. There is so much material within the first half of the class that unless you are a math genius it will be impossible to get an A on. Also the multiple choice questions are really tricky. I lost 8 points just on multiple choice. There is also one distance question that most people including me lost points on. I got a 39/60 while the average was a 38 I think.
Second Midterm: After freaking out about my first midterm I sat down from a week ahead and did every single HW and review problem for the sections that were on the exam. I ended up with 55/60 ( lost 4 points in multiple choice and 1 point due to not knowing how to add and subtract) The average was 49/60. Much easier than the first exam.
Final: So try to manage your time for the final. There is a tremendous amount of material that you need to know. If you know them the questions won't be that hard. You won't run out of time but you will most likely be stuck on one or two questions. I ended up with a 77/100. Have no idea what the average was.

My experience going into this course was that there was a lot of moaning and griping beforehand from friends who had already taken the course about how the lectures were really tricky to follow because of Prof. Heiklen's teaching style. I mention this because I feel like the course gets a lot of bad press on the word-of-mouth front but it's ultimately not that awful- in fact, it's probably well worth your taking if you plan on becoming a healthcare professional. Though it's probably not stuff that you will ever actively apply unless you become a researcher or an OBGYN, she keeps the course pretty relevant and lets you walk away with a good understanding of important scientific breakthroughs in what people commonly think of as ""stem cell research"" that will probably have significant therapeutic potential in next few decades.
Lectures consist of her explaining mostly unmarked slides: you should print them out beforehand to make notes on them: I realized after a couple of classes that you waste too much time trying to make diagrams in your notebook because the speed of her lecture is not slow enough for you to be wasting time redrawing slide images. As previous reviewers mentioned, Prof. Heicklen will also assume mastery of some basic bio stuff covered in the Mowsh lectures, so if you don't remember the premise of a lecture and you fail to ask her to do a quick review, the entire lecture will go over your head. This is mostly fine, because Prof. Heicklen generously makes recordings of all her lectures- they are very helpful for studying, and any questions that you still have after listening to her lectures can be clarified by her in office hours. She makes herself super available to students and is generally very friendly and enthusiastic about the subject, which is always great.
The exam questions are kind of hit and miss- the general consensus is that the substantive stuff she asks is not that hard: the difficult part is understanding what exactly she is asking in the first place, because she tends to phrase her questions in a way that won't make any sense unless you get used to her very specific lingo for describing dev bio concepts. You can have a very good understanding of the material, but still get a question wrong because you didn't understand the way she wants you to answer a question based on her phrasing. Luckily, she will also provide 4-5 years worth of previous exams, and those usually will help you better understand the types of concepts she's interested in testing, as well as how she phrases the questions. Also, she will hold review sessions herself before each exam. Go to these after you've studied. They will clarify A LOT of stuff for you.
Compared to other upper level bio courses at Columbia, the tricky part about studying for dev bio is not the difficulty or the amount of material. Those are both reasonable. The annoying part is going back to the lectures and trying to figure out what exactly she was trying to teach you. I say this without irony: there were a couple of lectures where the students left and half the class did not understand what was going on during lecture at all. Still, everyone seems to figure it out before the exams because between the recordings and the textbook and office hours, the resources are all there for you to get a good grasp of the material.
Part of your grade is based on one-page response questions based on recent papers, as well as in class clicker questions. The material on these papers will appear on exams. She helps you with those as well: 1 or 2 lectures before the actual article discussion days, she will give an introduction to the paper in class. During these introductions, she will usually talk about what she considers important (ie. testable) in the paper. Those explanations will usually explicitly answer 2 or 3 of the response questions, so it's important to pay attention when she's doing those intros.
Finally, the great thing about this class is that there is a ridiculous cushion for an A range grade. There was no curve for the A- cutoff: you only had to manage an 80% overall to get a guaranteed A-.
Overall, this class was not bad at all. Prof. Heicklen lectures fast and sometimes convolutedly, but she's a dedicated teacher and incredibly knowledgeable. If you just put in the work, you'll be fine.
Workload:
2 midterms (20% each)- if one grade is higher than the other, it will be weighted 30% and the lower grade will be weighted 10%. This is an amazing gift.
The Final is worth 40%
Paper response and clicker questions 20%
AND THE CRAZY 80% CUTOFF. The final median overall score of the class was just below the cutoff by maybe 3 points, so basically half the class got at least an A-. Ridiculous.
I performed mediocrely through the entire semester, and got an A. My final score was a little under 90%.
And yes. The egg is a wonderful bag of tricks. That is, as previous reviewers note, pretty much the one thing that everyone from this course will take away.

Worth noting before taking this course is that it is mainly taken by graduate students. This has pros and cons: the main pro is (perhaps) that there are a lot of students in the class who don't really seem to care. Sometimes this may be because some of their English isn't stellar; the main con, however, is that this might also be because they already know the material really well. 
No matter, though, because honestly this was one of the easier classes I have taken here at Columbia. The material totally has the potential to be really hard, but there is a solutions manual that you can Google for the homework, and the exams were the easiest exams I have taken since high school, no joke. They were almost offensively easy.
BIG BIG BIG word of advice: Sobel never says this in class, but he will ask A LOT of definitions on exams (literally 25% of the final was f***ing definitions). DEFINITELY know the axioms of probability, that was asked on both the midterm and the final.
Sobel himself is not the most personable man you will ever meet. He tended to be really snappy when people asked questions in class, unless of course you're an attractive female. Moreover, he is honestly an awful teacher. I learned approximately 0% of the material from actually attending class, and ended up teaching myself all of the material, which, I reiterate, was honestly not too bad. In class he tends to do a lot of proofs of theorems that we will never use. He does them in a really handwavey way - which might sound appealing to some, but he isn't GOOD at being handwavey, so it just ends up being confusing and annoying.
Please don't take my negative review to mean that you shouldn't take this class. This is honestly a great probability class to take if you want a pretty easy grade and are willing to spend some time near exams teaching yourself the material. I know for a fact it was much easier and less work-intensive than 3105 and the IEOR probability class (I have friends that took each of those at the same time I was taking this who confirmed this testimony).
Workload:
He gave us 3 homeworks, that each would have taken a pretty long time if I didn't have the solutions manual, but would have totally been doable. Anyway, THERE ARE ONLY 3 HOMEWORKS, maybe a couple more if he remembers to fit them in, so you have plenty of time to do them.
One midterm, one final, both very short, very easy. On both there will be a definitions section and a basic application of Bayes Theorem. In addition, the midterm will have some basic calculations with random variables, maybe a counting question, and a couple general distribution questions (find the constant c, are these independent, what is the marginal distribution, that kind of stuff). There also should be one slightly trickier problem where you just need to write things out and expand until it makes sense. The final, along with the questions previously mentioned, will have a couple binomial distribution questions, and some random calculations with expectations and variances and whatnot. Nothing too bad.

I'll get straight to the point: Pascale is without a doubt one of the best professors at Columbia. This woman is a godsend. Every single day she came in energetic and ready to teach, with the patience of a mother. I've been here for 2 years and this is the only Professor that I can honestly say wanted every one of her students to succeed. If you have the privilege to take one of her courses you'll understand what I mean. She's also one of the funniest professors I've had here, and her playful personality really made the class a joy to attend.

Emily is very smart and knows her stuff. She will work you very hard and can be very intimidating. I don't think she knows she's intimidating, but when she asks you a question, she expects an answer, and I always felt a little unsure of myself because it's impossible to know the material better than she does. Not everyone in the class felt intimidated, but I know it was a common theme. She's a hard grader (didn't get my final grade back yet, but reading almost all the material and putting in an honest effort, based off the feedback I've gotten so far, I expect to be borderline B+/A-).

Ursula is very sweet and nice. She's one of those teachers who sort of acts tough the first class to try to make sure her students take her seriously. But in reality, she's very understanding and accommodating. If she thinks the homework is too heavy, and the class can't cover all the material from the homework, she'll cut down and adjust accordingly. She is flexible and cares a lot about her students. She wants it to be as painless as possible. She even started bringing in treats every class to help us get through the 6:10-8 slump. Overall, quirky but a very good teacher.

Not bad. First half of first semester, we did prose -- Cicero In Catilinam I, which was a little much at first, but after shaking off the rust and getting used to Cicero's style, it wasn't bad. 2 sections per class. Second half we did Catullus (poetry). Weekly quizzes that were fairly easy to study for and straightforward. Midterm similar to quizzes but with historical questions she gave us in advance and an essay graded very fairly. Final same way and not cumulative. Lowest quiz dropped. One close reading assignment -- slightly research based but you have all semester to do it and it can be on anything, and you can submit drafts to her as often as you like -- ~5 pages. We were supposed to have a recitation assignment (recite some Latin poetry), but because we had a lot of subs, we didn't talk about meter enough and have pushed it off to next semester.

This class is taught by Larry Chasin for the first unit or so and Mowsh for the rest. The difference is incredible. I wish Mowsh taught the whole thing. Chasin uses powerpoints that are impossible to keep up with during lecture and drones on and on in monotone that's hard to understand. Mowsh uses chalk and models and handouts and speaks clearly. She covers all her bases and makes everything very clear. One thing I loved about this course was that all you really needed for it was a $26 workbook Mowsh wrote herself -- no required textbooks. If you pay attention in class and do the problems, you're golden. The book includes an answer key that explains the solutions very in depth. This was quite possibly my favorite class and nowhere near the stress and workload I had heard about, although I do know many people who would disagree. I think AP Bio prepared me well -- a lot of the material is review from that, just covered more quickly. Very little memorization, you just have to know the stuff inside and out for when she gives scenarios on exams that don't actually happen in real life, but can be solved if you understand the processes. The exams aren't exactly easy, but the curve is good. We haven't gotten our final grade back yet, but I expect an A.
Workload:
Recitations each week an hour and fifty minutes long, which are kind of annoying but chill. Quizzes, but the TAs typically make them easy because they don't really matter -- once you accumulate 60 points (points from each quiz just add together), you're done.

Sam teaches the unthemed section of UWriting, and I have nothing but positive things to say about his class. He is a PhD student and I'm not sure how long he's taught the class, but he does seem to have it down. As a disclaimer, I did well in the class (A+) and while I'm a science major I do enjoy writing, but it seems like many others did as well. UWriting is one of those classes that is hard to teach, because everyone from english majors to engineers need to take it but Sam tried to make sure that the readings for this section were recent, not unreasonably long, and interesting (for example there were two David Foster Wallace essays in the reading and some essays about New York). Most importantly, Sam is aware of the challenges of being a first year at Columbia, lightening work load around midterms, pushing back deadlines when we seemed overwhelmed, etc. His feedback on essays was always useful and helped to improve my writing, and the assignments gave us enough room to breathe and find what we were interested in within the text. Doing well in his class wasn't tremendously hard as long as you participate during class and take his feedback (important, you have the potential to raise your grade 1/3 of a letter if you're engaged, I calculated my grade without the participation bump and it should have been an A). Overall, sam is an engaging, understanding professor who knows UWriting may not be your favorite class but still grades very generously and makes it a pleasant experience. If you have the chance, stay in/switch in to this class!

Fairly usual for a UWriting section, four essays (like all sections are required to have), plus occasional paragraph-long ""talk about the reading"" type pieces for maybe half of classes that aren't graded but I do believe factor in to the participation grade.

This is a class for people who love chemistry and people who are chem majors. Not that anyone would take it on a whim. I worked harder than I have in my life for this class and did very well. Some concepts came naturally to me, but there are others I still don't understand. 
The first part of the class (up to the midterm) introduced point groups and covered main group chemistry: periodic trends, drawing lewis diagrams using natural resonance theory, and molecular orbital diagrams. The second half covered transition metal chemistry: more MO diagrams, electron counting, and some organometallic chemistry. Final was cumulative but focused more on the TM stuff. 
About Jon Owen: while he is a great teacher, he is not the best person to go to if you have specific questions. If you have a question about the grading or a nitpicky thing from the notes, fine. Asking him a conceptual question will lead to a 30 minute long answer that is very interesting and ultimately useless. Talk to the TA or other students instead. He's a great lecturer and the notes were usually pretty well organized (and he has great handwriting). The second half of the course was a bit rushed and much less focused. I'm pretty sure Prof. Owen didn't cover all the material he meant to. 
Pset questions are much harder than class examples, exam questions are somewhere in between. Sometimes molecules are taken from recently published literature. Find a study group or at least someone to talk through answers with. But do all the psets with intent! They are the only practice you will get for the exam!

While I personally did not appreciate the general concept of Frontiers of Science as a class, Eric made the discussion portion bearable and even interesting at times. Eric usually plans lessons that are directly related to the lecture material, and prepares PowerPoints to present the information. We often worked in small groups to complete small activities/worksheets related to the class material. I appreciated that Eric was clearly passionate about the course material, very approachable and available for office hours, and fairly flexible in terms of handing in late work (for the weekly homework assignments).

- weekly homework assignments: pretty easy, tediously long at times (especially if you don't enjoy Frontiers in Science in general) but certainly never too difficult conceptually to complete
- midterm and final exams: very manageable as long as you take some time to study - don't blow it off just because you are allowed cheat sheets on the exams! the exams don't really test your ability to memorize and regurgitate information so the cheat sheets won't actually help that much; the exams are meant to test the ""Scientific Habits of Mind,"" general tools that help you understand and interpret scientific information --> in other words, it's more about the scientific skills you gain than the content you learn
- term paper: the more effort you put into this, the higher your grade will be; it was nice that Eric gave us benchmarks (First Draft, Peer Review, Final Draft) so that we weren't scrambling at the end before finals to turn something in; in general, not a monumental effort

If your undergrad major is not finance or you don't have substantial prior work experience in finance or you have yet taken Intro to FE, I'd say avoid this class. You'll be a lot better off taking some introductory finance classes first and even then I'd choose this class at caution. I agree with the previous reviewer on almost all fronts, it's clear that the professor is not well organized, he tends to teach using his stories than following a rigorous and systematic approach. Don't get me wrong, I like a good story just as much as everyone else does, but for a class on pricing models, stories are not going to help you build a rigorous framework. 
Now the mini projects and exams. I enjoy the mini projects, they are hands-on, practical and requires you to think, which is a fantastic thing. But the professor does NOT give the answers to the projects (and exams) after we get the grades, his argument is that if we get the answers they'd start circulating and he won't be able to use them again later. I mean I see his point, but honestly what's the point of doing those questions and don't know how you get them wrong, isn't knowing what you did wrong a critical part of learning? As for the exams, they are not reflective of the course content and very much out of an engineering setting. In a word, I think the professor brings too much idiosyncrasy to this class.

Janet ROCKS! She was hands down one of my favorite professors during my first semester at Columbia, and the best English professor I've ever had. She's a fashionable, petite, cynically funny woman - you WILL fall in love with her within the first couple of weeks of class. She does a fantastic job of making sure that we analyze the themes of the texts that we read - this sounds like something all lithum teachers should obviously do, but many of my friends have complained that their teachers focus on less helpful things in terms of preparing for midterm/final exams (like learning a bunch of Greek word roots?!). In general, I feel like she really pushes us to strive for deep and complex analyses of the texts - she demands this on the analytical essays you will write and although it may be difficult to achieve her expected level of analysis, she forces and motivates you to improve your writing which is indeed the best thing a teacher can do. She always keeps class interesting and shows her interest in and passion for literature: she has no inhibitions about pointing out all the sexual jokes/references in Lysistrata; she acknowledges the driest/most cumbersome portions of the texts we read (the catalogue of ships in the Iliad, the choruses in the Greek plays, ALL of Herodotus and Thucydides) - but at the same time has the skill and will to show us the beauty and complexity even in these least palatable and seemingly useless passages; she makes a real effort (but doesn't take out unreasonably huge chunks of class time) to get to know her students personally and ask how we're doing in general, etc., and she studied at Columbia herself, so she understands all the toils (both related and non-related to LitHum) that we're going through.
She is not an ""easy"" teacher, she will want you to participate daily in class and contribute to discussions in some way (but she's even pretty reasonable about this - she explicitly states that she counts reading passages out loud as participation), and she will want to see you put in effort into writing your essays (GO TO OFFICE HOURS one week before every essay deadline), but if you want to learn a lot and truly enjoy LitHum in spite of the overwhelming workload, you must take Janet's class.
Workload:
- 3 papers --> I really appreciate that she made the first paper only 2-3 pages, and used this as a sort of testing of the waters for both her and us as students to be able to see what aspects of our analytical writing should be improved; when you go to her office hours you should come with a thesis/argument prepared, but even if you don't she will amazingly work with you to create one! basically, go to office hours for each paper no matter what!
- presentations: each student each semester must make a 15 minute presentation on one of the texts/sections of the texts, it's really convenient that she creates a schedule at the beginning of the semester and allows us to sign up for whatever text we want to present on; some lithum teachers make you prepare for a presentation for every single class and randomly picks a name out of a hat to determine the presenter of the day --> BLECH
- readings: I don't think any comment on the volume of readings is really necessary. If don't know the answer to this already, you might consider transferring to a different college.

I had this prof for her first time to teach a class ever, and this was a huge mistake. She's incredibly bad at time management, often only getting to the important content five minutes after lecture had already ended. She was available for extra help but after several prodding emails. She really does try, but she doesn't have the best English. It makes it difficult not only to understand her, but more importantly, for her to articulate complex ideas or answer questions. She is a tough grader, but if you go talk to her in person, she will sometimes give you a few points back (not many).

You will never get a more straight forward class in your physics education than this one. The first half of the class is very straight forward and mostly review from Physics III. The second half is a do-it-yourself kind of thing. If you want to make sense of the lectures you have to read the book ahead of time, and do practice problems. If you haven't realized yet, the more advanced that the physics courses get, the fewer number of problems they can reasonably ask you on a 75 minute exam. His exam questions come straight from the book, he is up-front about that from the first class. All homework problems are 2 and 3 star difficulty. So if you do every 0 and 1 star problems on your own (total of about 50 problems in Griffiths) chances are you have done all of the questions that will be on the exams. This is not a subject that can be explained through demonstrations or computer graphics, the best way to learn it is to read through the chapters, do all of the 0 and 1 star problems, then read the chapter again. The solutions manual is online (He also acknowledges this in the first class), and there is very little partial credit for homework problems. He doesn't throw any curveballs at you or try to trick you with any questions so take your time when doing homework and try to understand what is going on while using the solutions manual, do all of the above mentioned practice problems and you will learn a lot and do well in the class.  

   There is not much any professor could do to make the mathematics interesting or easier, his greatest gift to you is not giving you anything that is not fully answered in the text and solutions manual. Many other professors I have taken will throw in their own subjects without much explanation or a book to reference them which just confuse me and I end up not learning them at all.

Her lectures are outlined very well so that come midterms/finals study time you should have comprehensive and organized notes. Her exams are very fair so long as you do all of the practice problems she assigns as well as take the time to actually do the homework.

Ok but actually, Dr. Hughes is so awesome and incredible intelligent and so cute and every time I see her I just wanna hug her for being so amazing.  She's an amazing teacher and teaches so well and explains the lectures really well.  Also, NO QUIZZES! YA!!!! So while all your friends are freakin' about those 15 point frosci quizzes you can be chillen like ""yo, Dr. Hughes doesn't give quizzes and I'm prob learning more than you!"" She's insanely smart and can answer LITERALLY any question you have.  AND at the end of the term she invites her classes to her apartment for dessert and term paper discussions (ok seriously how cute is she?)

Casella clearly cares about the topic and does a decent job making you care about it as well, which is impressive given that this class seems to be given the shittiest room and the shittiest time slot (Mine was in 7th Floor of Hamilton at 8:40am). However, I have a huge problem with the way you are tested on the material. 
I guess to describe it, we are rushing to cover the material in class, during which we explore the issues at an intensity level of say, 2 or 3 on  scale of 10. In the end we ended up covering only 3 out of the 4 major units. 
Then, for the problem sets, we are expected to solve problems that are at a level 6 or a 7, and in order to do these, you will have to go to office hours and recitations and spend quite a long time figuring out stuff on your own since there isn't a textbook and you're going by pretty much just lectures, which once again, are rushed. If you're unlucky like me, you will only be able to make one recitation, which occurs after both classes, so you can't get much help. Luckily, despite being frustrating, these are worth only 10% of your grade. 
Then, for the exams, she suddenly decides to kick your ass and test you at level 9 or 10, except this time you don't have hours and office hours to figure it out, but 75 minutes or 3 hours for the final. You have no way to prep for the difficulty because what you are tested on is different from previous years because of the pace at which the class was covered and so that at least half of the material on practice tests are irrelevant. This is extremely frustrating because while there is a lot of conceptual stuff, there's also a lot of algebra that needs to be done, so you need to be very good at jumping between the math and the conceptual stuff. 
I really liked the material itself, but the way that the class was run and we were tested made me feel extremely inadequate. Her explanation is that everyone gets screwed, but I feel like there has to be a better balance between challenging us and making it too easy.

Not a big fan. I was a relatively good student in the class and tried to speak and voice my opinion as much as possible (she clearly stated the more we speak in class the better our grade will be the). The class is in fact in a harkens discussion group atmosphere. However when we do speak she cuts us off or belittles what we have to say...it's actually quite upsetting .

You will learn how the philosophies, such as Confucianism, Taoism, and Legalism, influenced people in the three countries in different dynasties, as well as how Buddhism developed in East Asian context. You will also be trained to think critically and write a history paper. The course also covers some contents in modern East Asia and how East Asian countries managed to keep their identities while being influenced by the Western philosophies and technology. 
The instructors, Sixiang and Allison, are very helpful. They are approachable and are able to give you valuable advice on your essays. If you go to their office hours, you will have a better sense of how to construct your paper. They will give you some guidance such as the materials and books that may be helpful, as well as how to find a topic that makes sense.
You are not required to remember many detailed things in this course. However. It will be better if you are able to comprehend the materials and see how they influence the three countries as they developed. There are two classes every week. One is for lecturing and the other is for discussion. If you are too busy to finish the textbook readings, then you should make use of the lecture since it will cover the basic history of the weekly topic.

Okay, at the risk of being anonymously passive-aggressive toward my classmates, I'm gonna jump in here and respond mostly to the Nov. 5 review below this one.
The syllabus was definitely not pointless. Odd, sure, but certainly relevant in obvious ways to disability studies (though I may have to agree about the Pope...). Then again the class wasn't really supposed to be ~about~ disability studies anyway, or even necessarily about disability as it's most commonly interpreted. It's not a theory course or a methods course but a literature course based on body difference very broadly defined—and that includes not just the obvious stuff like Jean-Dominique Bauby but weird shit like the magical talking wolves of medieval Ireland too. 
(Speaking of which, yes, there's a bit of a medieval bent to the syllabus, so if Beowulf and the saints' lives aren't your cup of tea, then the first couple weeks of the semester may well be a drag for you.)
Basically this class allows for a lot of flexibility in what ""disability"" means, and I can understand why it would be off-putting to someone who's trying to get at a more mainstream/contemporary/political/social understanding of the subject. Personally, I really liked the eclectic approach, and I think that it made for a more interesting class than simply reading, I don't know, 20th-century memoir accounts one after another.
TL;DR: This is a cool class and you should take it, unless you have some kind of unfortunate vendetta against medieval texts and using your imagination in which case you definitely shouldn't.

Sid’s a pretty chill guy. He works at a hedge fund which deals with distressed securities and really knows his sh*t. As someone who has no background in finance, I found this class to be on the harder side just because there was a lot of vocabulary I had to learn in order to solve problems.
You learn about fixed income in the first half of the class - NPV, bonds, hedging, convexity, duration, forward rates, futures and swaps. The second half is equities and options (CAPM and brief overview of Black-Scholes included). The class is completely quantitative. All homework and exams involve problem solving. Find an arbitrage trade, hedge the portfolio, construct a portfolio to match the option, what’s the value of new shares issued, etc. There isn’t any hard math - it’s all simple algebra and there’s almost no calculus involved. The hard part is knowing all the terminology and strategies. There are a lot of them and you quickly understand that finance is about the nitty gritty details, not general theoretical understanding.
There were 4 insanely long HWs (actually one of them was ok) that took forever to complete. The midterm was incredibly long and many students didn’t finish it in the 3.5 hrs allotted. The final was shorter and more reasonable, though still on the harder side. Problems are computationally difficult with lots of room for numerical mistakes even though you get to use a calculator. Honestly, for the midterm, we should have been allowed to use Excel to be fair.
About 90% of the class had a strong finance background either from quant/trading internships or previous classes, so it was hard to do well when everyone else was getting excellent scores. Also, they're almost completely masters students who have done this stuff before. Sid’s not consistent with grading. He initially said that HW would be graded on a check minus/check/check plus grading scheme, but we were later awarded numeric grades to 2 decimal points. After the midterm, he said that anyone with over a 105/150 would get at least on A-, but judging from the final grades awarded, I don’t think he was that generous.
Sid has a pretty strong Indian accent and talks really fast. It was hard to understand him in the beginning of the class but it’s manageable once you get used to it. His slides are also stolen from the B-school version of this class and he skips a lot of them during lecture which is kind of annoying.
Overall, a good class where you’ll learn a lot, especially if you’re interested in the capital markets but have no prior experience.

Unfortunately, I'm 1.5 years too late in writing this review, but no matter. As long as someone sees it, I'm happy.
First, I cannot emphasize enough how lucky Columbia University is to have Ilya (hopefully they still do??!)-- although he may be only lecturing at the Harriman Institute now, according to the bulletins I found. Ilya is one of the few lecturers whose courses focus on contemporary Russian culture and politics, both of which are woefully underrated and not very respected within the Slavic Languages department here at the undergraduate level. (Do keep that in mind, if for some reason you're still deciding between schools or majors. If you are into this kind of thing, definitely look at the Political Science department's course offerings.) Even so, on a human level, Ilya is one of the only ones here who can comment intelligently on what the mindset in Russia is like nowadays. I think he was still living and working in Moscow in the 2000's (not completely sure), so that contributes a lot to his expertise.
This course was perfect for students who wanted to learn more about the ""classics"" of Russian song (emphasis on the bards, but rock groups do come in), and had at least 3-4 years of Russian under their belt. I guarantee you that after this class, you will be incredibly familiar with the late 19th-20th century artists who hold influence among the Russian people. As far as I could tell, emphasis is placed on artists revered by more liberal, educated Muscovites and Petersburg residents (read: creative class, of which Ilya is definitely a part). As a result, you will impress the friends you meet in study abroad, so take this during or before junior year if possible! Another strength of this course is that your spoken and written Russian will improve. In fact, I would advise higher level heritage students to take the course (or try, since he will boot you if you're anywhere near native speaker level), because he will give you feedback on stylistics, not just grammar. For me, this was immensely helpful.
Before this class, I only knew about Russian pop singers and some classic rock bands, but knew close to nothing about the so-called ""bards."" I had not even listened to Vladimir Vysotsky, despite having quite a few native speaker friends. Quite shameful indeed. But now I do know of him, and many more important bards/bands. The music remains on my computer to this day, because it is very good. Ilya is a chill, funny and kind guy, and he has great insight into the songs and the artists. But you have to work for an A, because although he is chill, he still has standards and expects you to contribute in class and improve your language skills over time. No, the workload is not high, but that said, don't expect to skate by on b.s. either.
In short, if you can, TAKE ILYA'S CLASSES! ANY OF THEM! He's awesome!
Workload:
Very reasonable. Just about every class, write 1-2 pages in response to whatever prompt he gives you. To prepare for class discussions, listen to the songs assigned and research the artists (Wikipedia is fine). Every few weeks, you will be asked to present on either an artist or a song said artist wrote/performed. There was a final paper, which was also only required to be several pages long (mine was 4 pages).

This was the most painful class I have taken at Columbia so far.  I love art and was really looking forward to this class being light and fun, but it wasn't.  This is not a history class, but rather the focus is on being able to analyze the structure of painting, sculpture and architecture, which is cool if you are able to understand your instructor.
MSD has a french accent which can sometimes be difficult to understand and she also has a tough time with effectively relaying concepts.  Her presentation of material is also highly disorganized which makes it extremely difficult to take notes.  She'll show you one slide, grill you with questions that you aren't sure of how to answer, and move forward 3 slides only to go back 2 previous slides.  It was all over the place and super frustrating.  She did make herself available after class or by email, but asking for clarification didn't really help.  I spoke with many students in the class that felt just as frustrated and lost.
The workload was time consuming and some assignments actually included drawing.  One trip is to St. John the Divine Cathedral which you are expected to draw the outside facade of the church and part of the inside.  Granted, she explained she wasn't expecting a masterpiece, but it was time consuming and unnecessary, especially if you can barely draw stick figures.  The reading material was dense and uninteresting, and she made sure you read it by assigning reading responses.  3 to 4 museum trips, St. John the divine and walk around campus drawing columns.  Exams are a mix of identification of works of art, definitions and short essays analyzing known and unknown works.  Tough grader.

She is absolutely wonderful.  Not only is Prof. Craig-Florez extremely competent and effective at teaching, she is also very warm and cares about her students.  I came into this class with zero spanish skills and felt really worried and down the first couple of weeks.  The class seems to be geared towards students that have some basic skills in the language already, so if you're new it can be really intimidating and intense.  The texts for the class are almost entirely in spanish, so doing homework can take a really long time since you have to translate all of it.  My heart sank and I would sit in class with the dear in headlights look and a tummy ache, but she made me feel at ease and assured me that with practice I would be ok.  I wish I would've utilized her office hours as I'm sure it would've made life easier.  
Prof. Craig-Florez is very organized and keeps a fast pace, but slows it down for tougher concepts.  You'll need to get over any insecurity of speaking spanish in front of others as there's a lot of group exercises, but it was funny sometimes.  We had some laughs throughout the semester.  She's also a very fair grader and willing to work with you if you get sick and need to make up for something.  Make the effort and you will do well in this class.

This was my first philosophy class at Columbia and I absolutely loved it. Each week we dissected one work on the philosophy of history across two lectures. Professor Goehr effortlessly conducted the class towards a final, full understanding of the works through a combination of question-answer and lecture. As others have said, she is not afraid to call people out if their questions or answers are inadequate, but this never seemed mean-spirited. Instead, it forced the class towards pointed understanding of the philosophical ideas instead of falling prey to diversion, as sometimes happens in the hands of a less skilled and honest professor. Because of their brisk focus, I found these classes to be consistently engaging and downright intellectually thrilling.

Amber is definitely a newer professor, but her own writing speaks for itself. She let us read her dissertation on philosophy one night as homework, and her comments on your essay (and she writes more for you the more interest you show in class) are definitely worth while.

Ovid, as he told us we could call him on the first day of Calc III, is a pretty great professor. I believe this fall was his first time teaching Calculus (at least in many years?), but he didn't seem rusty at all, though perhaps a bit bored with the basic and stoic material we had to cover. Either way, he taught extremely clearly and was willing to answer any question that a student had for him. He is funny, every now and then, though his lectures can get a little dry.

I found Professor Baydil to be a kind, generous instructor who recognizes that W1111 is an introductory course and does not try to push her students too hard. Baydil often responded to student requests for extra time with problem sets positively, and was open to changing dates as students requested. I highly recommend this course - while the class was dull at best, it was not hard to get an A, and Baydil was pleasant and responsive to student queries. If you speak occasionally and sit in the front/middle, she will favor you and will be incredibly friendly. Not a challenging course for non-math/science majors.
Workload:
3 exams, about 7 short problem sets, 1 final project. She drops the lowest exam grade, and our first midterm exam was take-home. VERY reasonably graded, she is straight-forward in her expectations and doesn't put surprises on the exams. Our final contained reiterated problems from the second midterm with the numbers switched. Attendance was taken once (but is a large part of the final grade, so attend).

UWRITING - DATA SCIENCE
Long Story Short:
Take the class if you want to be entertained in class, and have a lot of time to devote to UWriting to make your progressions excellent because he is stingy with A's.
Full Review:
If you take UWriting with Aled, you will most certainly have a love/hate relationship with the class. In class, his Welsh accent is charming and discussions are interesting. However, he tends to stray outside of the normal Data Science texts and chooses articles that are cyborg focused or just very hard to grasp which can be very annoying because he does not clear them up well in class leaving you screwed when it comes to incorporating them into your writing. When it comes to the progressions, it seems as if he didn't have a full grasp of what was to be expected of the progressions. In other UWriting classes, professors had a clear structure of what was to be expected from their essays (some even outlining what every paragraph should look like). You will not find that in Aled's class. He will leave you to go out and figure out how your progression should be formed. Sometimes you will crash and burn miserably and other times you will hit it out of the park. He takes the longest time to get feedback on drafts back to you (if ever) which is a pain if you want to try to finish a progression early. When you finally get feedback back, do not celebrate too quickly if he left you positive comments! If you simply improve on those, you'll most likely end up with a B or B+ on the progression. Note: If you are writing on a tricky topic and decide to meet with him, you will most likely end up more confused than before you talked to him. Be smart- choose an easy topic that you can write about well because he grades pretty harshly.

The only reason I took Gen Chem with Beer was because it was the only one available when I registered for classes. Beer is a horrible lecturer and you will find that you will be teaching yourself the whole course. Nevertheless, it is important that you go to lecture so that you know what was emphasized so that you can do well on the weekly quizzes given by the TAs (who actually do not do much to improve your understanding of material in the course). Exams are multiple choice, so if you're not great at MC or guessing you will definitely not do well in the course. Beer uses Z-Scores so you will not know your grade in the course until it is posted on SSOL. 
If you have the option, do not take this class with him.

Definitely take this class if you are somewhat familiar with Spanish and want to complete the language requirement quickly! It is a fun class and enjoyable class Angelina really cares about her students. 
Here are a couple things to note:
1. DO NOT SPEAK ENGLISH IN CLASS.
2. Go above and beyond when writing your compositions. She will give you a rubric showing where you need to improve and will make corrections on your essays and will assign a letter grade for herself, but she will not give you a letter grade on your drafts. If you make all of the corrections, she will bump the grade she has in mind up a tad but not much, so it is just best to give it your all when writing the draft.
3. The class is mostly spent going over SAM and learning conversational Spanish. You are pretty much on your own for learning grammar.

Audra is an engaging professor and a very funny individual. This seminar-ish class had about 40 students in it and was a mix of her lectures and informal discussions among students. I was always excited to go to class, and learned a lot about the history of indigenous peoples in the U.S. and settler colonialism. Audra made an effort to learn everyone's name, and isn't afraid to poke fun at students and make jokes about the topics we're covering.
Topics for specific weeks included ""Land as relative, land as property,"" ""How expectations became Indians,"" ""How civilizations require representations,"" and ""turning the century and ""urbanization""/relocation."" The topics and readings progress mostly chronologically. The readings are in general interesting, but there are a few dry historical readings that you might just want to skim. Her lectures are a little disjointed and sometimes a bit repetitive as she is excited about many different things, but they're always very interesting and engaging.
Readings are not really ""required,"" per se. She will ask the class about the readings and they will be pretty relevant to her lectures, but you won't be personally quizzed on them and there aren't any midterms or finals that test you on them. The two reading responses (each worth 20% of the grade and 6-8 pages, as is the final paper that is 10-12 pages) come from each half of the class, so you should just read all of the readings for at least two weeks of the semester. That said, I'd read the ones you find interesting, because she has some good stuff on the syllabus! Your final paper is on a topic of your choice, and Audra mentions several times per class possible topics for your final paper.
My only complaint with this class would be that the TA (Margeaux Kristjansson) seemed to do the bulk of the grading. While she is more than competent, very nice, and very, very willing to meet with students and held lots of office hours, and while it seemed like Audra did look over some of the essays, I think most people would want their professor to actually provide feedback on most assignments.
Overall, DEFINITELY TAKE THIS CLASS if you are interested at all in Native Americans, indigeneity, the U.S.' Indian policy over time, or fulfilling your global core requirement. On a week-to-week basis there isn't that much work, and the two days we watched movies in class were pretty great, as were the pizza and cupcakes in class.

This is an International Relations seminar intended for juniors and seniors. Overall, TAKE THIS CLASS if you're interested in social movement theory, regime change, contentious collective action, or, of course, revolutions. Akhavi is an incredibly brilliant scholar who seems to have focused on Middle Eastern politics in his work, and more particularly on Iran. Readings are typically long and are in-depth, respected works from the poli sci/sociology canon. Discussions are crucial; students take turn leading discussions every week, so usually the second hour of class is reserved just for discussion after Akhavi lectures. It's very important to do the readings and pretty obvious if you haven't due to the small size of the class.
There are two exams that are somewhat unusual for a political science major seminar, but pretty leniently graded nonetheless. If you've done the majority of the reading and understand larger concepts, you should do fine. The only other grade, other than participation, is your 25 page research paper. He will help you come up with a topic and give you feedback on your proposal, and I've found he's very willing to help during his office hours with developing the paper.
This class focused a lot on the French, Chinese, Iranian, and Russian revolutions, and I wish we had spent a bit more time on other revolutions and Middle Eastern conflicts (though we did have multiple classes and readings on both). Overall, this was an enjoyable class and I'm now pretty well-versed in revolutions and social movements, which will only continue to be an important issue in the political science field. Akhavi is kind, extremely knowledgable, and engaging, and he makes an effort to get to know the students in his class. Take this seminar with Akhavi if you can!

There are few professors at Columbia which every student I have talked to dislikes, at Mark Brown manages to be one of them. This class is not actually very difficult, nor does it move fast, so it is probably best for you to learn from the textbook (which isn't amazing but not horrible) rather than go to class. The best option is to read the textbook and then supplement it with class, but if you do go to class (like I did), you should, at minimum, skim the textbook, or you will be horribly lost. Professor Brown gives little context for what he is doing. He does not tell you what he is trying to prove (which makes following proofs difficult since you have no idea where he is headed) and he rarely explains the conceptual nuance of what is going on. He also spends almost all his time in class proving things whereas, apart from the Extra Credit on the final exam, every exam and homework question is an application question, which means understanding the proofs is of little to no help in tackling the homeworks or exams. 
Apart from his inability to explain concepts, Mark Brown rarely pays attention to his students. He is 50/50 with being able to understand student questions, he rarely responds to email (and if he does, he is rude), and he doesn't return homework in a timely manner (we got a homework due in October returned on the last day of class). 
Overall, the material covered in this class is not difficult, and there is not a lot of it either. Even though this was, by far, my lowest workload class, it was the one I complained about the most because going to class with Professor Brown is a truly painful experience. If you learn the material on your own, and make sure you understand the concepts behind what's going on, this class won't be a high workload, nor will it be hugely difficult. Professor Brown provides a fairly generous curve, but given that most people take this class because it is a pre-requisite for other things, I would recommend taking this with another professor so that you truly understand the material. 
For sake of disclosure, I got an A+ in his class, so I think it is fair to say that my unfavorable review of Professor Brown is not due to my grade. He is the worst professor I have encountered at Columbia, and from what I hear, that Statistics department is fairly notorious for having bad professors.

I honestly don't understand the poor reviews of this professor. Perhaps he was not good at teaching other classes but, as far as the undergraduate version of Math Programming is concerned, he was one of the best teachers I have had. 
Professor Sethuraman is very good and providing the conceptual/economic explanation for the math that you do in this class, and he goes to great lengths to ensure that you understand this base intuition. This is extremely valuable in a class that would otherwise seem to be a class where one blindly applies algorithms. Jay realizes that computers can do the ugly computations nowadays, and so, rather than spending time on 9x9 matrices, we only do small computation to get an idea for how a specific algorithm works, and then we spend lots of time discussing the underlying methodology of an algorithm, situation in which it might no work, and what certain states of the algorithm can tell us. 
While Jay is not a ball of energy in the room, he has his own personality that makes class enjoyable, and he does a good job of raising interesting questions about the material that make you think about the nuances or corner cases of the algorithms. 
Unlike most professors, Jay appears to understand his students. He can tell when his students are confused and is willing to repeat a concept or explain it in a different manner if students don't get it. He also understands student questions quite well, and welcomes them in lecture, which makes it easier to pay attention, and makes the material clearer. I think a great example of Jay's dedication to his students is the way he approached the final exam. In his office hours, Jay asked his students what they thought the best way to administer the final exam would be, given certain guidelines. While he originally was not going to allow a formula sheet, after he asked his student, he decided to allow a formula sheet in order to allow us to spend time studying the concepts rather than memorizing formulas. The fact that he took time to think about his students needs and discuss the exam structure with them speaks for itself. 
Another example of how he understands his students: In one class, after students complained they couldn't see the board due to dying markers, Jay attempted to switch markers. Upon discovering that every marker was dying, he paused class and sprinted to his office to grab a new set to ensure that students in the back could see for the rest of lecture. There are many other examples of his dedication, but I'll leave them out for the sake of space.
Despite what I've said, this class isn't a walk in the park. It's not killer, but it's not a breeze. Even after paying attention in class and skimming the textbook, one might need to think about the homework questions for a bit (depending on the assignment), which is how I think it should be. His exams are fair, but are not easy. I would qualify them as moderate or moderately difficult. He will never pull something out of thin air. If you don't know how to solve a problem, you will at least walk out of the test knowing it was a fair question (this happened to many people on the final). His practice exams are fairly on par with the difficulty of his midterms, but the final is more difficult than the midterms, so it is important to understand the concepts underlying the algorithms. If you understand everything in your notes, you will be set for the final.
Long story short, if you actually pay attention in class instead of going on social media, and you put in a bit of time outside the classroom, you should be able to master this material. People who claimed that some final exam problems were unfair were, in my opinion, unjustified in their claims, since every problem came from concepts that were emphasized multiple times in his notes, lectures, and slides. Overall this is a great class, with a great professor. If you don't like this class, IEOR is probably not your jam.

Professor Blaer is a great instructor. He is clear, able to command a large lecture hall without much trouble, and able to explain concepts in a fairly simple manner. I honestly don't understand why some people chose not to attend this class because I found the book to be average at explaining concepts, while I found Professor Blaer to be exceptional at explaining the material. I rarely referred to the book after his lectures because I either understood the material from his lecture, or was able to understand is after digesting my notes. I think this is a sign of a great teacher. 
Even in a 200+ person class, Blaer was able to captivate the room with his large voice and abundant personality. In addition, he managed to encourage student participation, which kept the class interactive and engaging. In addition, occasionally, Professor Blaer would drive home the importance of a particular concept with a story about his research, which usually involved a hilarious and catastrophic ending involving multi-ton robots ramming into buildings or almost running people over. 
Professor Blaer's exams are fairly straightforward and he essentially tells you about 50% of the exam, so these are fairly low stress endeavors. I found the final harder than the midterm, but still fairly straightforward. Not much to worry about here. 
My only complaint with Professor Blaer is an organizational complaint. He would usually claim he would post the HW by a certain date and note post it till 3 or 4 days afterwards. He also granted classwide extensions in unecesarry situations which made the last HW assigned and due during reading week, which was poor planning on his part. Lastly, I feel that the first 15 minutes of class, where students as clarification questions on the HW, is a waste of time. If he wrote his questions in a less ambiguous manner, and used this class time to teach more material, that would be more efficient. Apart from those organization things, I can't complain about this professor. I would recommend his class to anyone in a heartbeat.

There are both good and bad to the class, but as it's Prof. Shalem's first year teaching I think it will be a year or two before the kinks in the course are fully ironed out. Prof. Shalem is nice enough as a teacher, and the course is okay. You should take this course if you're interested in doing a non-Western elective as an Art History major because the workload isn't bad. However, I don't recommend this course for non-Art History majors who are looking to fulfill a core requirement. There are far more engaging courses than this one for someone who wants to take an 'insteresting elective,' and your grades will just suffer because you're going to be competing against art history majors who have experience in memorizing and regurgitating slides and writing art history papers. All in all, this course is very meh. I wouldn't say it's bad, but it's sort of not very well organized and also not overwhelmingly exciting.
Lectures generally involve him going over around 50 slides (a pretty reasonable number) that are loosely focused on a specific time period or theme.
However, because he seems to have this aversion to making very concrete arguments as a result of what I imagine is his background in critical theory, he ends up either talking a lot about historical developments around the time which are often inconsequential to the pieces at hand, or talking about the pieces/buildings in extremely general ways. Things that you could have come up with if you just sat in your room with a friend and asked them to describe the picture they're looking at. He also has a tendency to talk about aspects of buildings/objects that he does not have images for, so you're just left with pieces of random trivia that don't really mean anything.
Someone is also going to call me a racist for this, but I believe what I'm about to say is an objective observation that I know more than 5 people in the class have agreed on: A lot of the stuff that he shows looks very, very similar. And he really seldom goes into a lot of detail about what differentiates those works from others and the significance of why certain pieces are being shown. As a result, you often walk away from class a little confused because you seem to just have been shown 30 bowls that look the same or 7 mosques that to an average person look identical. His aversion to making strong arguments makes this all the more confusing because you are probably not even going to be left with an idea to tie these together.
Shalem definitely also has an issue with time management. He regularly spent way too much time in lectures giving general, objective descriptions of a few works before realizing that he had run out of time to discuss the meat of what he was supposed to show us. As a result, he would often spend the last 10 minutes of class fast forwarding through upwards of 20 slides (I really am not making this up). However, towards the end of the semester, he would just consistently continue to lecture overtime for 10-15 minutes, which I didn't mind but I could tell it was troublesome for some other people who had classes or activities afterwards.
I really didn't have a bad time in this class, and I expect to get a straight A in this course, but it just was not terribly interesting or well presented because too many things looked the same. Or maybe they actually were very different but we were not told why they were different? I don't know, I guess I felt overall that if I had taken another class, I might have been able to walk away with more to show for it, instead of it having been an exercise in image recognition. Shalem is a pleasant guy, but I really feel like this course needs to be restructured a little.

I agree with one of the reviews below: Gamber is not a gold-nugget professor. He got the gold nugget because of his charisma and glib rhetoric. If you scratch beneath the surface you won't find much.  His analysis are interesting but often shallow and predictable because of the heavy-handed political statements he likes to make.  Gamber is himself a bundle of contacdictions: a ""man of color"" with blue eyes and blonde hair, he likes expensive suits and he is a disciplinarian of sorts. He often criticizes Columbia, for example because Butler library is named after a white man. If he dislikes this place so much, why did he accept the job offer? To fight the system from within? How about teaching at a Community College wearing a plain sweater? But he is also extremely kind and polite, the material is interesting (with some exceptions) and in the end the class is an easy A (just don't be late for assignments or he will fail you or just threaten to fail you).

A fabulous teacher, I recommend him wholeheartedly. At first, I was a bit concerned since it was his first time teaching Music Humanities. But Josh is a very down to earth, yet passionate teacher, and is clearly interested in helping all of us learn to love Western art music. 
Almost every class was interesting and engaging, and Josh always helped us better understand not only the music but the context of the music -- what sort of changes occurred both in society and in the music that make what we're studying worthwhile. He was also careful to clue us into controversies that surrounded the music, like the modern reactions to Wagner's antisemitism or contemporary reactions to Bach's Grosse Fuge. 
All in all the class was enjoyable and a lot more than I expected from the first time teaching a course. I have been in some train wreck classes where the teacher was passionate, but disorganized to the point that it made the course unenjoyable. This was not one of them. The class was clearly organized and Josh was passionate about the material. 
There were some kinks or complaints -- but I expect that they will be worked out for next semester. The main complaint I have was is that the syllabus had no schedule for readings or listening assignments, and instead they were given to us two or three days in advance by email. Josh later admitted that he was planning the course as he went, so kudos to him for consistently selecting good readings that helped us ground the music we listen to. Hopefully he will keep most of the material and give a reading schedule for the coming semesters. 
As far as workload, typically there were two or three readings for class, given to us in a PDF format. The book that is usually assigned for Music Hum was not necessary. There were about four or five listening assignments, two essays, three quizzes and a final. All very straightforward. Josh is clear in what he wants you to know and will go the extra step to make it as easy as possible for you to succeed, even going so far as to make study guides for us! 
In all, he really, really wants you to succeed in music hum. His class was always a joy and I always looked forward to it. Josh is the teacher to get for music hum, if at all possible. If you have his section, don't give it up! Even if the time is at 8:40. 
Workload:
- About five listening assignments. Originally meant to be weekly, though it was scaled down. Took about thirty minutes to an hour.  Usually they are very guided, so if you've never done one before, no worries. 20% of the grade. 
- Three short quizzes. Originally meant to be four, but one was pushed back and eventually cancelled. Each one took about forty-five minutes, if only because the listening portions were a bit long. Each one typically had three known and three unknown listenings, along with multiple choice and a short answer question. He gives us possible known listenings in advance, as well as what the multiple choice questions will cover (typically they were simple definitions). He makes us study guides! What other teacher does that? 20% of the grade. 
- Concert Essay and Second Essay. Each one is about five pages. The concert essay you go to the Music Hum Opera (ours was Carmen) and make an argument (any argument) about the opera (or opera more generally). He values originality but he also doesn't mind if your argument is not completely original. The second essay you got to pick between a second concert report, a comparison of two recordings of a piece of music, or a music in film paper. He offered to read over our first draft of the concert essay via email and then gave us comments. Each one is 15% of the grade. 
- Final exam. Basically a long quiz. There were six known listenings, six unknown listenings, two short answer, one short essay, and some matching questions (definition + word). He also gives a very detailed study guide for this! I am telling you, you can't go wrong with Josh. 15% of the grade. 
- Attendance and participation. You're allowed one unexcused absence. Participation is either in small groups or sharing your thoughts on the reading. 15% of the grade.

This was the worst experience I've had with a professor. I tried to ignore the previous reviews and go into this class without a bias, but they're basically all accurate. Professor Emir is a nice person, but he seems to put the absolute minimum amount of effort possible into this course. We never received a syllabus. We never received a rubric or concrete description of our final project, which we spent the entire semester preparing for -- the project requirements, inasmuch as there were any, were changed the up until day before the projects were due. The fact that he is also teaching the applied data mining course next semester is unnerving. 
 It was impossible to get excited about the way Birol taught the material (as evidenced by the fact that by the middle of the semester, 15-20 people would attend regularly) -- and I started the semester eager to learn the material. I attended class basically every session, but I didn't get anything from lectures that I couldn't have gotten from the summary slides he posted -- which themselves were screenshots from other statistics departments or photographs of our textbook. He was also never available to meet outside class besides at 8 am before classes (but was usually late or not there anyways).
It was good to get more familiarity with R, although it wasn't formally taught except for a crash course in the first week on (no joke) how to install it. The problem sets and project, however, demanded it. The lab sessions in the course description definitely do not exist.

Insomniacs, rejoice! Fuck Ambien - Musatti is the best sleep inducing medication out there on the market: her tedious, uninspiring, and convoluted lectures - especially her macro lectures - will help you fall asleep within five minutes of her opening her mouth.
Still, you should beware of side effects. Everything on and about the planet pisses off Musatti, and she will scream at students who (unsurprisingly) do fall asleep in her class, show up late to lectures, or even try to leave the room to take a piss.
Yet, Musatti unconscionably still boasts to her students that she's one of the few professors at Columbia who actually care about teaching, as made evident by her typo-ridden and terribly worded problem sets that teach students more about proofreading than about economics.
If you're dumb enough to take Musatti's class, you should attend the lectures, not to take notes but just in case she takes attendance - oh, sorry - I meant just in case she gives a pop quiz. (FYI: She'll tell you all the answers to the quiz anyway.)
Exams are easy. Midterm is slightly harder than the final, but the final covers more shit, so make sure you at least skim the book.
In sum, I learned more about economics from Khan Academy than I did from Musatti. I guess I'm the kind of guy Will Hunting would call dumb for dropping Gs for an education I could've gotten for free on YouTube.

One ""midterm"" - very easy AP style multiple choice questions plus some bullshit free response questions she pulls out of her ass.
One ""final"" - even easier multiple choice questions except they're typo-ridden like her problem sets, and the TA who can't speak English will waste 15 minutes of the already abridged exam time you're given (2.5 hrs, not 3) trying to clarify Musatti's mistakes. More bullshit free response questions she pulls out of her ass.

The topic of the class and syllabus are very interesting because at the junction of design, architecture, literature, anthropology. BUT, professor Gunel has a very poor English, it is very hard to understand and focus. More than 70% of the students left after the first class. 
Throughout the semester, professor Gunel was barely involved in the class. Her approach of the subject matters was very dull. She was reading her notes for the entire length of the class, commenting upon the readings in a very mechanical approach for more than 90% of class time.
Not a class I recommend AT ALL.

I had Professor Zeitlin for Calculus III, and my experience with him was not the best.  He is no doubt a brilliant man, but he does not seem to put much effort into teaching the class.  He basically just copies down his notes, which I didn't have a huge problem with because his notes mirrored those in the textbook very well.  My main issue with Professor Zeitlin was the way in which he handled students' questions.  He often scoffed at questions that he thought were stupid and sometimes refused to explain further, simply replying ""office hours.""  When he tried to explain, he would just repeat what he said earlier, unable to explain in any other way.  When going over the answers to the midterms, he barely took any time to explain the answers, and usually said something like ""I don't know why any of you struggled with this one"" about most of the questions.  For me, if I didn't understand a problem the first time, there was no way he could help me understand it further.  In that situation, I would turn to the textbook or look it up online.  
However, to be fair, Zeitlin's tests were very reasonable.  There were no surprises, and the practice midterms that he posted on Courseworks were usually very good representations of what would be on the test. Therefore, if you understand the material, it is very easy to do well in this class.
If you are stuck with Zeitlin, I would recommend attending another teacher's lecture (for example, Professor Hom or Lipshitz).  They cover the same material and the syllabus is very well-structured so that you can keep up with the homework and test dates without attending Zeitlin's class.  
Another note -- if you are one who struggles with understanding accents, his class will be more confusing for you.  He has a heavy Russian accent that I found impossible to understand unless I sat in the first 3 rows.   
If you have already taken Calc III or if you are naturally very good at math, you will be fine in Zeitlin's class.  Where he falls short is in explaining and answering students' questions, and so if you are not a very strong math student, his class could be very difficult.

Nicole is friendly and fun, but her class severely lacks depth and any kind of academic enthusiasm/knowledge on her part. If I were to describe her class: it's like that day you have a sub because the professor is sick, but in this case the professor is there. Expect a lot of YouTube clips that vaguely connect to course material, peripheral and superficial conversation of the readings assigned, and small group work on proper teacher-student etiquette (really). The class is not hard nor fulfilling, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to anyone who didn't enjoy sustained boredom and lackluster conversation while trying very hard not to fall asleep.

Professor Abraham is incredibly understanding and fair. He makes it a point to be available for his students. However, his method of teaching, at times, leaves a little to be desired. Having already had a substantial background in Spanish, I was able to nonetheless get through the course fairly easily but others often complained that his lectures were a bit sporadic. Most classes were spent doing various exercises or working with the book. It is clear that Professor Abraham means well and that he is very passionate about his work, but sometimes his class felt a bit like a waste of time. However, overall, I did enjoy the class and would definitely recommend him to somebody just trying to get the language requirement out of the way.

Content-wise, this class is great.  It really affected the way I understand voting, elections and fairness.  This is a unique class, and I highly recommend taking it for those interested in political science and logic.  There are downsides, but I think the opportunity this class presents in terms of learning outweighs the downsides.
The problems with this class stem from Lax's disorganization.  This might be okay if there was a textbook that you could use to compensate, but there is not.  This is a class where you are fully dependent on the Professor for content, and Lax is just not the type of professor that can do that.  Information is scattered, important basics are skipped, and most frustrating: nothing is planned in advance.  When there were handouts on information, I was able to understand the information more in depth, but these were few and far between, were written after the material was taught.  Why can't he just re-use from past years and hand them out on more topics?  This class was also very frustrating because midterms would pop up at his leisure (one week in advance), and you could never plan in advance for problems sets.  This just creates unnecessarily anxiety for students who need to plan more than one week in advance. On the last day of class we did not even talk about what would be included on the final, but the TA addressed the question 2 days before the final. The TA (Andy Guess) was great and filled in the gaps that were necessarily (I don't think I could have done as well as I did without his review sessions), but his review sessions also made it clear just how much more organized the class could be.
Lax is a nice person, and seems to care, but the students would certainly be learning more if he had his act together.
I am happy I took this class in terms of the information learned, but the process of learning was unnecessarily frustrating.

Be warned: Cannon does not hold your hand. He assumes that everyone in the class is wicked smaht and tailors his lectures, assignments, and exams accordingly.
But I strongly disagree with the reviewer below. I walked into Cannon's class with no programming background, but I found his class enjoyable and occasionally challenging. The only prerequisite you need to succeed in Cannon's class is good time management.
Start on your assignments early, and ask questions on Piazza or during office hours when you get stuck. Read the assigned chapters BEFORE you go to lectures: Cannon does an excellent job clarifying tricky material in class.
Aim for comprehension - make a serious effort to understand difficult concepts as well as your mistakes on the assignments - and you will do very well in this class.

I have never met a more lazy professor in my four years at Columbia.  
If you are looking for an easy course for which you have to do hardly any work, this is a great option.
If you are looking to learn something, DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE.
Each class was led by a student giving a presentation - they had to carry the class for two hours.  While a student presentation is sometimes nice, the professor should be expected to teach at some point.  He never taught.  It was such a waste of a class.
He also is not responsive, nor puts in any effort to the class.  He never knew what we were talking about in advance of the class, he didnt bother to learn the names of the 9 people who were in our class, responds very late to emails, and it took him a month or so to approve our final paper topics. It was clear that he never knew or cared about what was flying.  I did very well in the class, but do not feel accomplished or that I gained anything. 
I really do not recommend this class to anyone who is looking to learn in college.

I had some mixed emotions on this course. While Prof. Delbanco is very knowledgeable on the topics she chooses to cover (and many more, of course), and I really appreciated the perspectives on non-Western art, I'm not sure in the end whether the class was worth its troubles. 
But first, my minor issues with the course: 
- Expect a LECTURE course that focuses mostly on Chinese art with some relatively brief looks at Japanese (and even more rarely, Korean) art. If what you liked about Art Hum or other art history courses was the discussion, you won't really get much of that here. Any times students speak up in class is either to answer questions prof. Delbanco asks which are so obvious there's usually a good amount of awkward silence after them because no one wants to answer them, or when someone goes out of their way to ask a question to potentially analyze what we're seeing. In short, while you learn a lot, it's mostly through what she tells you and not what the class works together to find, which is what for hopefully many people, Art Hum was like. If you like to discuss things a bit more (specially when the class is in a dark room, usually early in the morning), then this may not be the ideal course.
- She talks a LOT. Most of the class consisted of her droning on and on for the full 75 minutes (and as the semester unfolded, sometimes 5 or 10 extra minutes). This may not seem that bad, but as previous reviewers have said, this can get quite boring. She also reviews a lot, which is great but eats away at the time and makes her rush through things towards the end. Because she reviews and rehashes her claims over and over so much, you barely have to study that hard, the material is really ingrained if you attend. But again, people usually looked quite bored.
- Like many other Columbia courses (specially art history courses), this is obviously NOT a survey of all art in China, Japan, and Korea. While a lot of the themes I assume extend from period to period (she will make the case that this is so), you definitely won't come near to seeing a large amount of art. Instead, you'll learn really in depth on a smallish selection of topics. This also sadly means that literally more than half the course is composed entirely of pottery. May not seem that bad, but 14 or 15 lectures on ceramics can get to be a bit... much. And we actually didn't even move beyond the 12th century or so with Chinese ceramics, so there was still a lot to say.
- The class feels a little bit too involved at times. There's two papers (involving Met trips and, for one of the papers, sketching two landscape paintings), and the final includes two essays, one of which is a topic of your choosing you have to pre-clear with her, so you're really writing a third paper itself for the final. On top of that there's two other Met trips that are not mandatory right before the midterm and the final, but I'd say 90% of the class attended. There was also a tea ceremony we attended which was nice, but also did take up a bit of a Saturday afternoon. In all, expect a moderate amount of time dedicate to the class.
Now, my major issue with the course is that, while I really appreciate art and art history, most of the class felt like a stretch. It was actually a bit frustrating in how predictable some of the statements were (""At first glance these paintings look radically different, but I'm going to show you how they're actually quite similar...""; ""In essence, these two traditions then are not so different..."") I almost would have liked for something a little more unexpected from this course than the typical art history analysis. It's like Delbanco pulls every trick in the book of talking about art history.
Other times it honestly just felt a bit too much like a stretch: ""this calligraphy character is in essence an abstract representation of this central mountain in this painting"", ""it's as if these trees become a self-portrait of the artist himself"", ""He places his signature with his inscription close to the trees as if saying 'look here are the trees; this is an image of me'."") This really may not be that big of a deal, but trust me, by the last several weeks, it gets tiring.
Lastly, it felt like there wasn't much room for free thought in the papers or the class in general. For the papers, if you went to her office hours with an idea, she would not-so-gently suggest not to do that and instead, write something that she would pretty much write out for you on the topics she chose (for the second paper, she said she only thought one painting in the Met was worth writing about, so there wasn't even a choice there). This is great in that she almost writes the papers for you and tells you specifically what to focus on, but it felt more like her imposing her viewpoint in very leading essays, and it also meant that if you didn't go to office hours, or made a statement in the paper that she didn't in essence pre-clear, your grade might be affected because the analysis just wasn't what she had thought of. 
In a way, I almost learned not necessarily how to think about Asian art, but how to think about what Dawn Delbanco thinks about Asian art. Now, if that's the mainstream way of thinking about Asian art, then great! You've learned it. But sadly, it was hard to tell sometimes.
To be fair, I'll end with the positives:
- You learn a lot
- She gives you ample opportunity to learn and discuss outside of class, with Met trips, office hours, etc. (That may translate to the class being too involved, but if you need it it's there)
- She's really smart and seems like an authority on the subject
- The grading is weird (she said she doesn't like giving many grades above a B+ early in the semester), BUT it's fair and she CURVES so it's not that hard to do well in the end. Don't worry if at the beginning you're seeing B's and B+'s on your papers or midterms.
TL;DR: Though there are some positive elements to the class, like the tea ceremony, and how in-depth she goes into the class, and for some the lack of discussions may be a positive (though you still need to attend lecture, she takes attendance!), I'm still not sure if I'd take this class if I knew from the beginning what it'd be like... I'm not saying don't take it, because it's still a good class academically-speaking, the material is interesting and worth studying, and the workload isn't horrible at all (most weeks you won't do anything at all other than show up for class, which you have to do because she takes attendance and she'll spew out the answers to what she asks you in essays and tests), but it really may not be that enjoyable... All in all I give the course a B-... It's okay, but it could be a lot better. Others have raved about the course, so this was just my impression, but this course may not be for everyone.
Workload:
Moderate: Two papers (20% each), Midterm (20%), Final (40%). Two optional Met trips before each of the two tests, plus a Japanese tea ceremony (also optional, have to pay $5-10). Attendance mandatory. Readings not essential (I probably wouldn't bother even getting the books).

Highly recommended course. I never thought Econometrics would be so understandable. She really goes through everything in detail, skipping over what she says is of a difficulty beyond the scope of this course (she acknowledges her own hand-waving), and the tests are quite fair. She repeats the basics constantly and, if anything, you come out of this course with a very solid framework for thinking about Econometrics from a more advanced level than in Intro. But the math is really not that hard. The hardest thing you must do in terms of computation is matrix multiplication, which is pretty basic. The difficulty in the course, I think, comes from the more difficult topics like Asymptotics, but towards the end of the course it'll all be very, very clear if you stick it through. Like a previous reviewer, my math background was only the Calc I, Calc III, and Intro. to Stats required for the major, plus of course Linear Algebra (getting only a B+ there), and I did fine in the course and found it to be enjoyable and very clear and useful. It's definitely a worthwhile course, with not as bad a workload. Serena is also charming in her own quirky way, and the TA for the semester (Paul) was helpful as well (though I think he's graduating this year so he may not be around for the next course). 
The hardest part may have been, in all honestly, the 7 problem sets (the TA wrote them all, I think) and the Matlab coding. Chances are you'll go to the TA's office hours at least twice just for the MATLAB help (and granted, some problem sets, like the probit/ logit one, were quite difficult). I had some experience with Java previously so I wasn't too lost, but even people with absolutely no coding experience got it, and it's a nice skill to have and put on a resume. Plus Matlab can do some neat stuff.
Small warning though: She tends to make mistakes writing stuff down on the blackboard. She’ll constantly forget to write down primes or inverses, or flips stuff around like a Hausmann test being beta_RE - beta_FE instead of beta_FE - beta_RE like it’s actually supposed to be… So the TA will usually give his disc. section and then write down a different estimator or variance and you’ll be perplexed as to why… and sometimes even he was a bit confused, so it’s hard to really know whether you’re actually learning the right equation because Serena will give you a different version than the TA's because someone forgot a prime or an inverse or simply screwed up (more often than not, the TA's version was correct and sometimes even clearer to understand... Serena tended to rush through writing things down so she'd forget a lot of the small things like primes, which change the whole estimator). Other than that though Serena’s great, and this is a really good course to take. It’s honestly not as hard as it may sound. I personally found metrics so much more accessible and intuitive when done with linear algebra and projections/ matrices than with summations in Intro. If you have even the smallest interest, and have a baby's understanding of matrices, you owe it to yourself to try this course out. It's not that hard, it'll look nice on a resume and transcript (specially if you're considering graduate work), and at the very least gives you some bragging rights when it comes to the inevitable ""What classes are you taking?""
""Yep, Advanced Econometrics.""
But you, and everyone in the class, will know it's not that bad and revel in the knowledge and the comfort of venturing the course and hopefully having succeeded.
In short, 9/10 would take again.

Midterm 2 (last day of class): 40%
Note that she cancelled the November midterm and essentially gave us a final on the last day of class, so it had a lot of material, but it was quite fair if not on the easier side. People did quite well in it.
If I'm not mistaken, she said something like ~40% of people get A- and above, and around 67% get B+ or above. So the grading is quite fair if not generous.

I agree mostly with the reviewer below me. Basically, Augustin is very enthusiastic about the material, teaches energetically, and is fairly approachable in person and happy to discuss research topics. The main issue is the lack of organization.
He seems to be a pretty busy researcher, as he had to cancel two classes and was often not reachable by email/Piazza. It seemed like he kept pushing back assignments/the exam. At one point he scheduled a make-up class on a day that we are not scheduled for, and we finally had our midterm the last day of class.
Also, the grading scheme was not very clear, and the exact percentages were definitely never announced until he sent us a note at the end of the semester. We got very little direction for the final project, which is basically a very condensed 2-page paper that is supposed to have interesting, novel, and relevant results in a research area. This was by far my lowest grade, but in the end he curved the class quite highly.
I would say the workload was quite heavy, relative to how much we learned in lecture. By the way, there's no textbook - only recommended reading from A LOT of papers (some from sociology). Note that this class is very math/theory heavy, so you really need to be comfortable with probabilistic analysis and graph concepts. I came from this background and still sometimes felt challenged. There are also ""data challenges,"" which basically are exploratory problems with real data. The stressful thing was that our programs were graded relatively to each other, so performance was normalized against the best performing program.
Finally, the TAs were not that helpful, and we always got back grades very late. I felt like I was in constant anxiety the whole semester and too busy to really appreciate the material. I spent half of my vacation working on the research paper, which in the end, was graded  harshly. Augustin knows his stuff and is overall a nice guy, but the way he managed the class made it very stressful.

Eleni is such a nice prof and great lecturer. She teaches very clearly and has very well written slides. She will often use the blackboard to go over a proof or concept more carefully. There were also two guest lectures from researchers at Google and Facebook on Ad bidding and MapReduce, which were nice treats and quite interesting. This material is not tested.
The only thing is that this class was the ""Data Science"" version of the normal Analysis of Algorithms class. This meant there were a lot of IDSE students, who didn't have much CS background. This really, really slowed down the pace of the class, with all the questions that were asked. If you come from a CS background, you would be better off taking the normal Algos class.
Homework was a combination of theory and programming, however, which is nice. Any language is ok, although Python is preferred, especially for the linear programming. TAs took a long time to grade the homeworks and offered little feedback.
Exams were comprehensive, and essentially tested understanding of the main results that were showed as well as algorithm design/analysis. Averages were very low, but I think that's normal for any algos class. Final is easier as long as you understand NP-completeness and reductions.

Simone is very nice and has a lot of potential for teaching. She can get a bit flustered during class, which shows her inexperience, but she also works very hard to explain the nuances of Greek - a difficult task. Not only is she willing to put in the effort, Simone also was willing to experiment with a flipped classroom. This willingness to innovate should help her with teaching in the future. She is flexible in terms of late assignments as long as you turn them in and is very willing to work with you to succeed in the course. Her grading is not easy, but fair.
The course in general was fairly standard as far as (my impression of) classical language classes go. Quizzes every class mean regular memorization of vocabulary and grammar. Homework is also on a very regular basis. Make sure you go to class prepared; you'll almost certainly be cold-called and embarrassed if you don't prepare. Don't be fooled by the slow pace early on, the class really picks up after the first of two midterms. Greek is a fascinating language, but it's a ton to cram into your head. Make sure you have the time to dedicate to it.
Also, make sure to take advantage of the random Greek / Classics things that Simone presents (e.g. trip to the Met, ancient Greek music, random accentuation pronunciation, etc). I found them to be quite enjoyable even though I have little exposure to Classics.

I took Lit Hum with Max and had an average experience. Max welcomes open discussion and allows students to steer the focus. He encourages dialogue amongst students for long periods of time before interjecting with his own interpretation. Unfortunately, his insight into the text was uninspiring and fairly banal- often not easy to follow either. He is pretty easy going and welcomes a sense of humor but he also forces the academic persona, which can lead to aforementioned pontifications. Pleasant to meet with one-on-one. Fairly chill dude but not going to inspire most.

Can't stress how awesome Luke is (echoing the person below me). He's relaxed and does a fantastic job incorporating class opinions as well as his own thoughtful reflection on the CC content. You could get away with avoiding the reading for the whole semester as he never put you on the spot and provides extremely specific study guides for the midterm and final. That being said, you'd do yourself a disservice since he does give a participation grade- but because the class often goes off on tangents related to philosophy/politics/contemporary world affairs, you could probably get away with talking during those segments.  
Luke's the chill albeit geeky teacher you want to impress.  Go to office hours to talk about papers (which can be on the longer side) or just chit chat; essentially, you should befriend him! He's an incredibly smart, amiable guy and I'm a total fan girl in case that wasn't obvious already.

wow, heather is easily one of the worst possible experiences I've had not simply with the core, but throughout my entire academic life. yes, it was pretty bad — i almost want to transfer out of columbia because of her.
so here it goes. her class is discussion based, where she gives a brief 5 minute background of the author of the books we are talking about and then opens the floor. the problem with her discussions is that she fails to make it organic. in class she’d go, “OK Person X talks, then Person Y, then Person Z, and then we’ll spend 7 minutes talking about …”. this stifles the flow of conversation as she fails to foster a natural progression of ideas. she would disrupt interesting ideas that people had thoughts on and jerk the conversation in a direction that she deemed fit. while some people like the intense rigidity, it didn’t provide the experience I was looking for. also, though admittedly a more minor point, CC is also supposed to be a class where we can see how the ideas of philosophers centuries ago are relevant to modern day, and we only began doing this at the end, at the request of students. while i respect her intelligence, she still has a lot to learn about what a CC class should be, and more generally, how to teach. she also needs to be more comfortable in our skin — she’s a little awk.
now for the worst part, the grading. the main parts of your grade are participation, the midterm, 1 10-12 page paper, and a final.  for our first reading quiz, some people thought it was out of 50 instead of 100 it went that bad. that was our first and last reading quiz. our midterm was graded pretty harshly too, and who knows how she did participation. now you might be thinking, “wow only one paper how great!”. but here’s the problem —(1) you have no idea what she looks for in your writing (2) there is no room for improvement/rewrites since she literally gives the paper back the day before the final (3) she does a poor job encouraging students to meet with her. writing is like a muscle that needs to be exercised, and even though CC isn’t university writing, it is a class based on the expression of ideas and writing is a medium in which we do that. now I’m not saying that we should have had a writing assignment due for each class, but I’d prefer having multiple smaller papers so professors can see the evolution of our writing and work with us to strengthen our writing abilities. for the record, i read a majority of all the books, genuinely attempted to think and tackle with the ideas talked about in CC, and received a pretty bad grade. 
the only good thing that heather did was bring in bryonn bain for class one day. he was such an inspiration and legend, and his performance about prison injustice was awesome. that’s the only credit she gets though.
P.S also, never say ""I FEEL THAT…” when expressing an idea. she’s a stickler about this one and will dock you participation points.

Would highly recommend this class! No prior knowledge of African history is required. 
Professor Diouf is brilliant and unbelievably knowledgable. The subject matter is interesting and wide-ranging. Professor Diouf often integrates historical examples from other regions of the world into his lectures, based on the students' interests. 
While his lectures can at times be hard to follow, you will be exposed to a fascinating array of concepts, theories, and bodies of knowledge. Lots of great food for thought. 
The class is heavily historiography focused. Professor Diouf is primarily interested in getting his students to think about how histories are constructed. He forces you to think critically about the material you are learning and also material you have learned in other history/mesaas courses. 
Best of all - he is incredibly kind and approachable!

This class was both frustrating and disappointing. The material is painfully easy (in a Fro-Sci like manner). I took it at the same time as Climate (v2100) and there was probably a 60-70% overlap in course material. It was apparent that there was very little interaction between TAs and Professors and that one didn't know what the other was doing. We also were not assigned any work until about halfway through the semester, and then assignments were assigned in rapid fire. We were not given a syllabus at the beginning of the semester with assignment due dates and clear expectations. The TAs didn't hold office hours until the end of the semester (I'm not sure what they did until beginning of November). The entire class felt like chaos. 
In terms of lecture: Most people did not go consistently. I did and I thought Griffin was a good teacher, but Mutter was extremely difficult to hear (even sitting in the front row). He also seemed to take offense when he was asked to speak up or wear a microphone.  
This class was a nightmare of an experience. If the material was not dumbed down and incredibly easy, I would have had a much bigger problem. All of this being said, I got an A in the class (I think they curved a lot at the end).

This class is amazing. It's a lot of work and takes up a ton of time but McManus and Shaw are both the kindest and most caring professors I have ever had. The two are willing to meet with any student at any time, which is hard for them because they split their time between Morningside and Lamont. I don't consider myself a science person and at times the material got a bit tricky, but McManus and Shaw are always willing to explain something over and over again. Overall though the material isn't too bad and the professors are amazing. 
The labs take up a lot of time, but overall the TAs are fair and are also always willing to explain the material or why they took off points somewhere

This class was not difficult, but an unnecessary amount of work for a basic sociology course. Bearman always said that he needed to give us assignments to generate grade variance, but the amount of work we were assigned at the end of the semester did way more that that. (see below for workload section). Bearman came in and simply read word for word off of his lecture notes which were posted for us online before the final (even his jokes and tangents were written down on the lecture notes). The TAs were fine- not great not particularly terrible. I thought Adam (the head TA) contributed too much during discussion to the point that he was just talking back and forth with Bearman about things not relevant to class discussion, taking up students' time for no reason. 
The material was interesting- I do feel like I have an understanding of basic sociological principles and why we act the way we do.  
There are 1-2 reading for every class. You don't always have to do them, but there are quizzes (5 throughout the semester) =. These quizzes are very easy, 1 question to see if you did the reading or not, but if you go to lecture, Bearman usually announces a ""pop"" quiz for the following class, so do the reading then. His lectures do a pretty good job of covering the readings

Eleni is such a nice prof and great lecturer. She teaches very clearly and has very well written slides. She will often use the blackboard to go over a proof or concept more carefully. There were also two guest lectures from researchers at Google and Facebook on Ad bidding and MapReduce, which were nice treats and quite interesting. This material is not tested.
The only thing is that this class was the ""Data Science"" version of the normal Analysis of Algorithms class. This meant there were a lot of IDSE students, who didn't have much CS background. This really, really slowed down the pace of the class, with all the questions that were asked. If you come from a CS background, you would be better off taking the normal Algos class.
Homework was a combination of theory and programming, however, which is nice. Any language is ok, although Python is preferred, especially for the linear programming. TAs took a long time to grade the homeworks and offered little feedback.
Exams were comprehensive, and essentially tested understanding of the main results that were showed as well as algorithm design/analysis. Averages were very low, but I think that's normal for any algos class. Final is easier as long as you understand NP-completeness and reductions.

Professor Bearman like all1 the other comments was pretty out of it during class and had a nonchalant way of relying important facts or thinks one needed to know from the final. I walked away from the class not learning or understanding anything, despite reading the readings and doing well on the projects and quizzes.

This was one of the coolest classes I've ever taken, and Professor Agueros was the perfect fit. Because of the low number of people taking the course, he replaced the midterm and final this semester with a midterm presentation (on really cool astrophysics topics like gamma ray bursts and Type Ia supernovae) and an oral final (everyone studied the same paper for this final, which was about the effects of mass loss on the evolution of high-mass stars). Both were pretty enjoyable to study for and they were DEFINITELY preferable to taking a legit midterm or final. He did end up asking some difficult questions on the spot, but he'd always try, at least, to point you towards the answer.
The lectures were always interesting. I slept less in this class than I have in any other class, which says a lot. Professor Agueros had a lot of really neat Powerpoints, he'd always derive the equations (but wouldn't take a crazy long time with derivations), he always spent the right amount of time between the powerpoint and the board, and - this is, to me, the best thing - he ALWAYS made sure to emphasize exactly why what he was talking about was important. Always. It was really, really refreshing to experience a professor do this, especially in a class where some of the math can get away from the physical meaning. We'd always have to think about the results we got in a larger context (i.e. ""What does this mean for the star?"")
The problem sets were, to be quite honest, pretty tough. But at the same time, they were the kind of ""tough"" wherein you see the problem and know you have all the tools to solve it - it's just a matter of thinking through it and figuring it out. Weirdly, I think I would've enjoyed more homework in this class, because there were always really cool applications of concepts in class that you'd never think of. But at the same time, having only four PSets was a blessing.
Finally, Professor Agueros made a pretty conscious effort to introduce guest speakers, fringe topics, and scientific computing to the class. A lot of problem sets had a computational component, in which we had to compute some stellar models and answer questions about them. It was very different than what we were used to, but you could tell that he was trying to form the same habits that he and all the guest lecturers already had. The guest lecturers were always relevant to what we were discussing and they too were vulnerable to being asked difficult questions by Professor Agueros on the spot, which was (sadistically) kind of fun to watch.
Overall, this was a GREAT class - if you're really interested in astronomy and stars, I would definitely recommend you take it.
Workload:
Four problem sets - difficult, but do-able. Midterm presentation - fun, and graded pretty nicely. Oral final - slightly less difficult than the PSets, but with the added bonus of having Marcel help you towards an answer every 20 seconds. All in all, not bad at all.

If you're interested, at ALL, in astronomy or astrophysics - Frits is your man.
Professor Paerels brought everything in this class down to a very, very, very digestible level. At times, it seemed like a lot of his lectures were oversimplified (and sometimes this was true), but at the end of the day he made sure everyone had a functional knowledge of the astrophysical topics at hand. And if you had any astronomy related question - it didn't have to be related to the coursework - he was always ready to talk it out. Sometimes, half a lecture would just go by in question-and-answer sessions with Frits. That got annoying at times, but it's also a testament to how well he can take high-level astro concepts and bring them down to a first-year undergraduate level.
As for this class specifically, it was pretty easy. The problem sets are designed to walk you through each step with very minimal math required between each part - it was a little simplistic at times, but hey, it definitely made sure everyone was working towards the right thing. Additionally, he really emphasized understanding the physical meaning of results we obtained by calculation - ""what does this number mean in the real world?"" We had a midterm and final. The midterm was in-class and was open-everything (as such, it was slightly more difficult than the PSets or the final; this was the only graded portion of the class in which I lost points). The final was take home and basically just another PSet. This was a pretty fun class and I'd definitely take another class with Frits if I had the chance.

This class was pretty good. You barely have to read the books - get the main points, have some questions, and come to class - his presentations do the rest. Sometimes I wish the class was more discussion-based, but then I remembered that would require maximal effort on my part, rather than just reading a little and studying my notes from class. Sometimes we have good discussions in class, but not that much. He assigns small papers as reading checks - they're basically participation points, but they require you to write like two pages. There are two larger papers that you have to write (around 6 pages) that take up more time than normal, but he grades these pretty nicely.
The midterm and the final for this course is a lot harder than the essays or in class discussions, but that is mitigated by the fact that he gives you way, way, way more time than you need to finish everything, and he doesn't believe in passage IDs. He grades you solely on the basis of how you write, think, and come up with ideas about the text (and he generally likes most ideas that can be backed up). Additionally, there's a question on every exam that deals with art history (he discusses a lot of paintings along with the works that we discuss in class, which is really cool because he really knows his stuff when it comes to art), which is different than most CC classes, but in my opinion, a lot more fun.
All in all, having Professor Barriendos made this course a lot more bearable, grading-wise, work-wise, whatever - it was just a lot better with him. If you get him as a professor, rejoice.

Man, was this class an experience. Let me start by saying Wang Laoshi is an absolutely excellent teacher. She might just be one of the best Chinese professors in the nation. She has a very, very good understanding of what students are likely to have trouble with and she focuses her lectures more around those things, which makes going to lecture really valuable (it's also mandatory, and 4 days a week, which can get annoying but it is what it is). However, this does necessitate that you do a lot of work outside of class.
You need to do a LOT of work outside of class.
There are quizzes basically 3 times a week (remember, there are 4 days of class a week). In themselves, they're quite short (typically 5 vocab words and a sentence), but the list you need to study from is usually around 30 words long. The days we don't have a quiz, we either have homework due, an essay due, or a test. The workload is quite intense, but it is, after all, a 5 point class. And when you do it all, you really feel like you have an understanding of the language.
There is about 1 day a semester when all the stars align, and you have nothing due - no quiz, no homework, no essay, no test. Take the day off. It will not happen again.
Tests in this course are not terribly difficult, studying the grammar structures worksheet that she gives out in class usually allows you to get at least an 85. Homework is also pretty easy and not too time-consuming. Essays are very time consuming, and she expects more of a five-paragraph type format (which is something she doesn't really expound on in class), which means they're graded a bit tougher. All things considered though, it's not the difficulty of the work that can get you; it's more the volume. 
Oh yeah, you're also required to go to a drill session once a week to practice your speaking with a TA and a few other students. Pretty standard fare.
I think I would have drowned in all the work had I taken this course with anyone else, but taking it with Wang Laoshi allowed me to live through the experience and come out with a way better knowledge of the Chinese language to boot. I can't stress enough how good of a professor Wang Laoshi is - a lot of this review is complaining about all the coursework, but her expertise and niceness and perfection as a professor makes the experience wholly worth it.
Workload:
Extensive, but expected for a 5 point class. Regular vocab quizzes (5 vocab words from a list of about 30, along with a sentence or two). Homework due once a week (for a total of 16 homeworks).

Professor Hailey was an atrocious professor for this course. I was excited as hell when I saw the silver nugget. Do not make this mistake. Hailey makes it painful to attend his totally unorganized lectures in which he'll spend more time attacking students for their questions than teaching correctly. You never really do figure out what's important and what's not, and you end up studying solely from his problem sets, which are never graded on time, and his practice exams. In fact, his problems sets are typically graded AFTER the relevant exam grades have been posted. His problem sets would be appropriate difficulty for this level if he EVER taught the material that he tested us on, or he EVER gave us relevant readings. 
It would have been far more useful to have a single, unified textbook for this course than the hodgepodge of irrelevant notes that Hailey posts on Courseworks. The little optics handbook was actually quite useful. The modern physics textbook we used two chapters of and had to pay over a hundred dollars for. Hailey is always going on about his important research and how great of a professor he is - why doesn't he just write the relevant textbook? 
No matter how much I disliked Hailey as a person/professor, I do have to respect the fact that he had basically a 24-hour office hours policy where you could knock at any given time and ask him about something, or shoot him an email, etc. That sort of policy is something that really good professors put into play, and I'm pleased that Hailey, at least outwardly, makes that effort. But that's sort of muddled by the fact that any time you ask a question that he deems too ""simple"" or even too ""advanced"", he'll throw it under the rug and launch into some ad hominem attack on other majors or something. It's a shame to see such a good policy in use by a professor that simply does not make it work.
I definitely learned a lot from this class, but I think I would've learned as much by just buying a modern physics textbooks and doing some practice problems. I don't think that's supposed to be the point of the course. I really think this course needs a major overhaul.
Workload:
A total of 7 or 8 extremely confusing problem sets that require a hell of a lot of group work. These are typically graded 1-2 months after the fact; or, if you prefer, 1-2 weeks after the exam for which it's necessary to study the problem set. There were two midterms - the first was in-class, and was difficult but fair; the second was take-home and a lot easier (and still fair). The final was pretty easy, and pretty short.

Prof. Donoghue is kind and approachable. He encourages participation and student questions. He brings the material to life with really interesting examples and, occasionally, videos. His lecture delivery could use some work, as he can be a bit difficult to follow, but all in all, he means well. 
I had two main problems with this course as it was offered in Fall 2014:
1. The size - There were 160 students in the class, and it was by far the largest section of Stat 1111. (The other sections had about 60-80 students). Prof. Donoghue said on the first day that he tried to learn every student's name, and he seems like a professor who would really shine in a smaller class. I think that this semester, Prof. Donoghue's effectiveness as an instructor was hampered by the class size. For one, our class was so big that we were placed in a room that is not typically used as a classroom. The makeshift projector screen was small and difficult to see from many parts of the room. 
As the semester progressed, attendance dwindled down to embarrassingly low levels. I would say that less than a third of the class attended regularly. Some students imagined that, as a result of the sheer size of the class, they were basically anonymous to the professor. People would regularly walk in late, walk in to turn in their homework and then just leave - this is not only distracting, but incredibly rude.
2. Homeworks - HWs are graded based on both completion and correctness. Students who gave the homework their best shot might still have gotten a low score if their answers were incorrect. Homework was originally 25% of the grade, but then the professor learned that some people were cheating. As a result, he made homework just 15% of the grade, and made the midterm and final each worth 5% more. 
My advice to the professor: Rather than assigning textbook questions, write your own homeworks. Heck, have one of your TAs do it. As long as the answers are out there, and some students have access to them while others don't, it is unfair to grade homeworks according to how correct they are.

Professor Tsygankova is an amazing teacher and a fair grader. She will put in a lot of effort into helping you with your writing and is very responsive on email. She will read all of your homeworks, but they are not graded.
In terms of grading, she offers an extra credit assignment -- attending and writing a short essay on any presentation given by faculty at Columbia. She also offers a revision of Progression 1 or 2, for a completely new grade. If you struggle at first in her class, don't worry because she will do everything she can to improve your writing and give you a fair grade in the end.
She clearly cares a lot about the course and will try and encourage discussion, but at times has difficulty encouraging seminar discussion, but this may also be because I took a section that started at 8:40 in the morning.

My final impression of this course is a positive one. I found Daskalopoulos to be sweet and accommodating, and the class progressed at a reasonable pace. The majority of the classes were spent first deriving theorems/discussing techniques, and then going over a few examples. Perhaps sometimes she spent too long explicitly writing out each step of a proof, although I she certainly isn't painfully slow. She certainly knows the material and is able to answer any question confidently, understanding common pitfalls that many students have. While working through examples, however, she often makes many algebraic mistakes, although a handful of students who always seem to be paying very close attention always are there to correct her. She makes herself available and approachable, and was receptive to increasing, within reason, students' midterm grades who were graded by an unusually harsh TA.
The class itself certainly won't be your favorite math class at Columbia, with material being a toolbox of techniques, such that whenever you see a problem, you must only identify which technique is appropriate and the answer should produce itself. From class to class progress can seem slow, although at the end you do realize that you have covered many techniques.
The homework usually was a little more tedious than I would have liked. The examples from the book (Boyce & DiPrima) usually are not too polished, and will often have you writing many pages of algebra for certain problems. I found the problem sets always took between 3-6 hours a week, so it's not too bad. Having said that, if you do all the homework (which is worth almost nothing) you'll hardly have to study at all for the midterm / final. I thought those tests were extremely reasonable tests, with a perfect score being well within the reach of an attentive, responsible student. You should be familiar with all the aspects of the existence/uniqueness proofs, which apparently tripped up many students. The most helpful way to study for these tests, I found, is to make a study sheet that just lists all the different techniques you've learned and familiarize yourself with them before the test.

One thing I'll say is that the lecturers usually are very competent, and if you have any actual questions about anything related to their fields, going to their office hours will usually be a fruitful experience, although you might have to wait in line as other students ask questions pertaining to the lecture material. I wouldn't say that I learned nothing interesting in Fro Sci, but learning definitely isn't required to do well in the class, and all interesting material will be repeated many times (so don't worry about missing it the first time around).
If you ever want to take 6 classes, definitely do it while you're taking Fro Sci, as it shouldn't take up too much of your time.

Alex is easily one of the best math TA's I've had. He's quick to reply to emails, holds very helpful review sessions, and is eloquent in his explanations. Although Bayer provides a handful of past exams in addition to a practice exam and homework which are all similar to the midterms, Alex's practice exams are usually much more challenging than the actual exams and push your understanding of the material. This is extremely helpful especially when Bayer decides to change up a few problems in the exam, which often trips up students who simply memorize patterns and formulas. Overall a very approachable TA!

Charley is incredibly intelligent, knows the material inside and out, and is very good at explaining the more abstract concepts. He will go out of his way to make time to meet with his students and really wants to get to know them. 
This is, however, the most work-intensive CC class that I've heard of and, on top of that, he is a very tough grader. I'm all for working hard, but in this case, I found the workload ridiculous and unnecessary. A huge chunk of our class switched out for second semester. Hopefully he'll respond to the critiques and adjust his syllabus, but fair warning: if you're in this class you have to be prepared to work HARD with no guarantee that you'll be rewarded with a good grade.

I highly recommend both graduate students and undergraduate students to take this course as it makes a connection between sustainable development/environmental studies, politics, and economics and ties it all together with social issues and concerns. Professor Sadeh is a very sweet person who is always ready to help her students, and advise them as to where they want to take their final projects. There were a lot of readings, but all were very interesting and compelling, and each reading addressed a different issue relating to Sustainability in Israel and beyond. Also, Professor Sadeh invited guest speakers to our classes which made the discussion in class very interesting, and helped students in choosing a topic for their final project.

I took this AI class with Ansaf. I like her teaching style and her class. She focus on the searching algorithm and machine learning for most time which are quite interesting to me. It is not easy to cover all the machine learning algorithms in less than half semester so that she taught a little bit fast in the machine learning part. The after class studying will be necessary if you want to grasp these algorithms. I also like her homework. She have assigned four homework, all programming in python. Most of them are very practical problem(for example to program a AI for 2048 game) and some of them are very challenging. 
It is hard to say the importance of this class to me. Honestly I expect more in this class because firstly I have taken machine learning before and I want to have a systemic understanding about how to build up an AI. But after taken this class, what I have learn and what I can understanding is not clear enough. I cannot say that I have a clearly and systemic understanding about how to build up a practical AI. Maybe it is because the artificial intelligence is a quite wild field that cannot be cover by only one class in one semester. If I can arrange the topics in this class, I will set this class as a higher level class and the machine learning class should be required before this class. Then the professor may discuss more in AI rather than take most of time to discuss machine learning and algorithm. 
All in all, Ansaf is a quite instructive teacher. For those students who haven't taken machine learning before, this class is very useful and you can learn a lot in this class.

I really don't understand the hype behind Xavier. He is a funny dude at times, but I found his class and topics covered to be very boring and not engaging. It may have been the sheer size of the class, but it felt like Xavier would be rambling on-and-on forever during class. With no doubt, I can say that I never paid attention to a single lecture, and I never attended a single recitation session.
However, one appeal of the class is that it is very easy. Recitation notes are online and all you need to prepare for the midterm and final. If you work hard enough, you can learn the entire course material in a day. 
If I had to choose again, I'd probably take Xavier again, but wouldn't make the mistake of trying to go to class and pay attention again.

Taussig is bat-sh*t crazy, but it is not hard to get an A. He did indigenous dances, described in detail what it's like to trip on acid in the Amazon, and spoke at length that he believed our classroom was haunted (we consequently moved classrooms multiple times). I had Fernando as my TA, and the grading was relatively generous if you were decent at talking out of your a**. A few unbelievably pretentious hipsters ran the course and were thoroughly beloved by Taussig, almost to an inappropriate level.

Professor Harrist is an old fashioned professor.  He expects you to come to class and takes attendance because he wants to learn the names of all his students. If you have no interest in Art History or China, this class will bore you.  If you can pretend to be interested for 2 hours a week, you will learn a lot from a professor who obviously knows what he is talking about.  Yes, he is a tough grader and yes he expects you to memorize a huge amount of dates and Chinese names.  You will be much better off if you are familiar with Chinese language.  I found the readings were very unnecessary and stopped doing most of them after the first month.

I started the semester thinking that this would be my least favorite class, since I am not a fan of grammar at all. I only registered in the course because it's a prerequisite for the French literature classes I need for my major, but I am so, so happy that I ended up in Pascale's class! She is by far the greatest professor I have met here! The first two or three classes with her were pretty nervewracking, because she tries to scare away students who are expecting an easy class that they can float by in. But you'll quickly see how funny she is, and while sometimes her jokes are at students' expenses, it's all in good fun and she is equally self-deprecating. As a teacher, it is very clear that her students' progress is her number one priority, above grades, reviews, etc. She places a huge amount of emphasis on improving for the sake of learning, rather than for the GPA points. To back this up, she grades compositions fairly but always allows at least 2-3 rewrites in which she'll raise your grade if you actually take the time to better them. She expects you to work on the grammar exercises yourself, and come into class with any questions you might have. At the end of the semester, she asks students what they most want to review and focuses on that. Her exams are very fair, just various grammar questions and a composition or two.
I can't emphasize enough how amazing of a teacher Pascale is. She really, truly cares about her students' improvement, and she sets up 2 or 3 meetings with each of her students during the semester, in which she goes over the things that you have the most trouble with and gives you advice. Go in to see her as often as you can! I've had some really great chats with her and she's really an incredible person as well as teacher!

Hansen is the Calc Teacher you want to have. Recent PhD. student graduated from Brown among other top universities. Perfect English speaker, gives very good notes, and easy homeworks. He also rounds out your homework grade to a full 20 percent even if that is not your actual score on the homeworks. He is funny quirky, and a Steve Jobs wanna-be in terms of his style. On numerous occasions he also has said ""I know none of you are Math majors so there is just no reason for me to complicate your lives by teaching you this.""

I had Mme. Jouanneau-Fertig for two courses and am currently trying to get into another class with her. She's one of the best teachers I've had in my college career. She's very structured; she has a syllabus, and she sticks to it closely. In every class she has us review the syllabus and points out any interesting things we should keep in mind, such as quizzes, presentations, and film-viewings. Unlike in her Review of French Fundamentals class, Mme. J-F talked to our ridiculously small class (6 people with the cap at 12) in French 95% of the time, which is understandable given that you can only take this class once you've at least taken Intermediate I. In my class, we either finished/ tested out of the French requirement or were taking Intermediate II.
As this was my first French class that was not grammar-intensive, I was taken aback by all the grammar and vocab I had to recall, and I was initially frustrated my progress in it. However, because of all the talking we did in class (it was inevitable since there only 6 of us), as well as the interesting various points of discussion, I definitely improved in speaking. Madame is very good at coaching us.
Madame is a very fair grader. She would take notes while we talk to the class and then later point out what was great and what we need to work on. There are also vocab quizzes, which personally bogged down my grade a little, but that's a matter of discipline. With the amount of vocab we had to study, you can't study for it overnight.
Madame is an enthusiastic, friendly, and supportive professor, probably one of my favorites. I wouldn't have taken another class with her if I didn't like her personality and teaching style. I would definitely recommend this class for those who struggle with speaking in French. You really improve!

I'm not sure that Paul Siegel is the best Calc I teacher, but I would definitely recommend him for taking Calc I. I came into the class having taken High School Calculus (which is easier than AP Calculus AB), so I had seen about 80% of the material we learned in class. However I did not have the greatest grasp of it. The class starts off with a long review of pre-calc and at times for me this felt very roundabout. However maybe for others with no calc experience this was helpful... The class starts with pre-calc and ends with integration (volumes, polar coordinates, substitution). There are two midterms. The first one is on pre-calc and limits. The second one is on derivatives (derivation rules, implicit differentiation, related rates). No midterm covers integration and this part of the class is brief. Because of this integration is the most challenging subject of the class.
However Paul is a great teacher that actually cares for his students and he doesn't want anyone to fail. His office hours are the best for HW help and he's willing to talk to/work with struggling students. Paul gives written and online HW; the written HW is hard (however if you look online you can find solutions to the problems.) One note is that the TAs for this class are completely useless. The only place you can reach them is in the Math Help Room, however once you go there it's hard to recognize they are the TAs for the class because they don't distinguish themselves from the other helpers at the Math Help Room. Sometimes the TAs would not even know how to solve some of the problems on the homework! Worst of all the TAs grade the homework and seem to arbitrarily grade. Paul would show one way to solve a problem in office hours, then the TAs would mark the problem wrong without indicating where points were taken off.
This class was definitely harder than my high school calc class. There may or may not be a curve at the end of the class. For class we had a slight curve. I had an 83% raw grade which was given a B+. I know this isn't the best, but I'm going to try harder for Calc II.

Jay isn't the most spectacular professor but he makes the class enjoyable, accessible and keeps things lively. He likes to focus more on discussion between students rather than dictating his own views. This also translates into 40% of your grade being class participation, which can be good or bad depending on how much you like talking. 
Overall he's a fair grader and provides several options when it comes to paper topics. His exams consist of passage IDs and an essay section, but he actually gives you a list of 7-8 topics beforehand and says he'll put 3-4 of them on the exam for you to finally choose one. You're also allowed a letter sized cheat-sheet, and you can write on its front, back and sides as he likes to say. 
He usually opens class with a presentation on the text at hand, which includes some pictures, historical context, a summary of concepts presented, and often movie clips and writings that he likes to relate to the text. Some of these clips usually also show up on his exams so it's good to keep a note of them. 
He has some other quirks like insisting you submit a hard copy of papers by 5 pm sharp on the deadline, and asking you what kind of bubble tea you're having, but he's a nice, friendly and reasonable professor who puts in a lot of effort into the class. Overall, I had a good experience albeit not a mind-blowing one.

If peeing your pants is cool, consider Professor Wright to be Miles Davis.  Yeah, that doesn't make sense at all, but you get my point -- Professor Wright might very well be the biggest weapon amongst the Columbia faculty.  Dude's an absolute torpedo.  He'll rifle into class and immediately shoot out a handful of jolly ""good morning's"" and ""aaawlright's"" towards the class.  Shortly thereafter, he'll write the words ""good morning"" in the most illegibly legible handwriting on the most dysfunctionally functional smart board.  In no time, you'll have your tail between your legs (at least I did) as you wait for the lethal weaponry that Wright has in stock for the remainder of the hour.  Well I'm writing to tell you what exactly that is.
The bottom line is Wright is well-prepared, helpful, and always available outside of class; he's also an extremely intelligent dude who possesses a solid ability to explain challenging concepts to students.  His pithy lecture notes are available online, but it behooves you to read the text to clear up concepts from the class notes.  The highlight of the course comes at the end of each lecture when Wright recites the following from memory in an angry tone: “Galadriel his sister went not with him to Nargothrond, for in Doriath dwelt Celeborn, kinsman of Thingol, and there was great love between them. Therefore she remained in the Hidden Kingdom, and abode with Melian, and of her learned great lore and wisdom concerning Middle-earth.”  As he spoke these words, the class would get jacked up and begin grunting curse words in a sacred middle-earth language that no one (including myself) could decipher.  In order to mitigate these outbursts, Wright would sometimes randomly select a student to deliver a Lord of the Rings quote to the class.  Unfortunately, I was never summoned. But basically, I heard if you recited a legendary quote from memory, you were likely to receive an A- or better in the course.
Hope that helps! :)

I took his Borders and Boundaries seminar. I found the lectures to be dry; there were really no main points given and the content was extremely Mexico-centric. I also found it completely troubling that Lomnitz rarely wished to stray away from the assigned readings. Bottom line: I found it difficult to connect with the seemingly random texts and walked away with very little from this course.
There were also no expectations set on the course. My advice is to approach him and specifically ask him what he is looking for through the assigned readings and final paper. During office hours, we was not very approachable and I walked away with little - if any insight on how to tackle the assigned readings and the overall themes of the course (which were never really outlined during lectures).
It seemed to me like each week was a sort of ""guess"" what we might talk about for the week. In grad school, I felt like this teaching style was rather elementary.
Also, be sure to confirm the assigned readings each week. The bibliography on the syllabus was scant and students often showed up to class having read the wrong texts (some of the readings were in excess of 500 pages).
I really had high hopes for this course - unfortunately, the only course that I've walked away feeling like I was worse off in the topic having taken the course. 
Comments on paper were far from productive; commentary was sarcastic and not very helpful. Students lacking prior anthropology work should refrain from taking this professor. Students are assumed to have prior anthropological work - if not, Lomnitz does not seem to be concerned about 'teaching' or even discussing basic anthropology concepts. I recommend this course to grad students who have prior work in this field - this is not a course to take if you have been out of school for a few years.

Professor Brus is just a bad teacher. By the end of the class, less than 50% of the students went to lecture. His notes are available online, and the homework and book assignments will definitely help you learn the material if you are motivated and diligent. But going to his class is nearly pointless, as it's impossible to understand what he is saying as he teaches. I could not hear him, he mumbled a lot, he was completely unaware when his microphone was not working, etc. The only benefit from going to lecture is the consistency/focus on the class you might get because of the schedule; also, he occasionally diagrams something on the board that you will need to know for a test (something that can't be found online). Overall, if you just want to get skip a semester of chem, you have a strong chem background, and you like learning on your own--go ahead and take intensive. He's often the only professor teaching it.

Take this review seriously. I mean it from the bottom of my heart when I say that Jeffrey Lax is by far the worst teacher I have ever had the misfortune of coming across. I mean it. While yes, he is sometimes funny and seems sweet in the classroom, don't let this fool you. I  went to every single class of his Logic of Collective Choice class, and you bet I paid attention, and studied HARD (more than any other class I had) but I still had no clue what was going on in the class by the end of the semester. You know why? - because Lax is, quite frankly, a SHIT teacher. Do not take this class. Or any other class he teaches. I beg of you. Seriously, shame on Columbia for hiring such a terrible teacher. I might as well have taken a class taught by a hamster - I probably could have learned more, and killed myself a little less of the theorems that YOU CAN'T EVEN FIND ONLINE. Did he just make them up?

Professor Panayotidi  has a love for Civil/Structural Engineering, but unfortunately I think almost all who have had his class would agree that teaching is not the appropriate facet for his passion.
Lectures consist of Professor Panayotidi displaying his handwritten notes and example problems on the projector. Luckily, these notes are also posted on courseworks. However, following his work is very confusing and frustrating, as he pulls numbers seemingly out of the far without displaying the equations or from where in the Steel or Concrete manual he obtained that equation. Hence, he tends to simply read what he wrote down which, needless to say, is difficult to follow.
Time in class is not used productively. He often gets on long tangents redundantly describing how most structural engineers do not do their job properly or lecturing us fairly condescendingly on how we need to study harder. That he takes attendance and calls out people who come in late or are obviously having a bad day does not help.
The class ""Structural Design Projects"" had a large group project which was supposed to be a semester-long project. Because of his poor time management, Professor Panayotidi fell far behind schedule and instead assigned the project immediately before election day weekend, with a major deadline the day we returned from the long weekend. Despite our insistence that this was not fair given that a large share of the class already made plans to go home over the weekend and it would be virtually impossible to arrange a group meeting with such short notice, he simply told us to ""Do what you have to do"" in somewhat harsher words.
Professor Panayotidi seems to have favorite students. Admittedly, I was one of those favorites and recognized that I got more of his attention and respect when I came to him with a question or comment. He can be quite rude to those he does not like (publicly, and privately from stories I have heard). Because of this, it is difficult to approach him, as he does not hide that he is surprised by your lack of knowledge and responds abrasively.

Semi-weekly homework assignments are fair.
Midterm was not too difficult but tested more structural analysis than structural design. (I'm guessing that will not happen again.)
Final exam covered whatever he went over in class that was NOT tested in the homework or midterm. Because lectures were not very clear, this presents a problem.

I hate to sound like a broken record, but the previous reviewers are absolutely right about this professor. For the sake of avoiding stress, protecting your GPA, and being productive I would avoid any of his courses. It's unfortunate because the material itself is so interesting and the course had so much potential to be engaging and enlightening. However, this was thwarted by the incompetence of Professor Kato. Several times he didn't know the specifics of his own syllabus, and when questioned about the discrepancies, was sometimes rude in his responses.
If you have a TA in his class, count yourself lucky! It’s sad when the TA is basically your only hope for receiving more clarification on the frustratingly unclear assignments. Part of the reason why his class is so stressful is because his instructions for the papers are so vague and unhelpful. If you ask him for clarification, he will tell you to simply “Answer the question” as if that’s the insightful solution to the problem. However, the worst part by far are the readings-they are so long and he expects you to complete them in such a short amount of time that it's virtually impossible to keep up if you're taking other courses. Some of the readings are in fact interesting, but are hard to finish when you basically have 200+ pages to read for each class.
On a more positive note at least he tries with his lectures-sometimes he infuses YouTube videos, songs, and lyrics into the teachings, making them somewhat entertaining. All in all, take this course with another professor or just avoid it completely.It was a waste of time.

Prof Ansaf is very friendly and the class was interactive. There was a good balance of traditional AI topics such as agents, search algorithms, CSPs and logic with a focus on machine learning in the second half of the semester. The prof mainly used her slides but there were some chalk board sessions as well. The slides were very well prepared and Prof Ansaf takes you through the math in a very simplified manner. The slides are sufficient and the text book can be used for any reference reading.
There were four assignments and all of them had Python programming. Basic programming knowledge is sufficient for this class as Python is easy to pick up. There was a Python recitation taken by one of the TAs in the beginning of the semester and it was very helpful to get started. The assignments were interesting (application of AI to games like 2048, mazes etc) but time consuming - as you can keep trying to improve the performance of your program. Definitely the best way to understand the intricacies of the algorithm though and the prof was kind enough to give additional time on the assignments when required. There were a lot of opportunities to score extra credit if you needed to catch up on a bad performance. We had one quiz and a lot of suggested reading material if you were interested. The course covered a lot of topics - AI and ML related. But the midterm and final were both open notes so you could focus on application rather than memorizing formulae or algorithms. The exams definitely made you think but as long as you understood the content it, the problems were solvable. The final grading formula was very generous and took the best performances into account for most students.
The TAs were helpful during office hours and on Piazza. Especially close to exam time, the response time of the prof on Piazza was great which helped a lot.
The professor balanced heavy course material with lighter ""historical moments of the day"" and current events in AI which made the two and a half hour class easier to get through. We also had a guest lecturer in the last class. All in all the professor really cared and took great initiative to give us more information than strictly the course content and made the classes more fun.

I am in love with Professor Ritzenberg. It's really hard to pick favorite courses within the English department (for obvious reasons, to anyone who knows anything about the department), but this class is definitely one memory I will treasure and one of the better seminars I've taken. 
-- More about Prof. Ritzenberg: 
In his emails before the course began he sounded very serious so I wasn't sure what the class would be like, but he is one of the most approachable profs I have ever had. He is easy to talk to in office hours, both about the coursework and other topics (eg career, etc.). To go along with this, class discussion is one of the most painless I've ever experienced -- we've all been there... Lit Hum classes where no one talks, English seminars where only one god-awful obnoxious kid talks... In our class, I think everyone felt that the environment was one in which it was easy to contribute, and I definitely heard every person in my class speak up at least a few times over the course of the semester, even the quietest (and I've definitely been in classes where I forgot certain people were even present because they literally never spoke.. I have also been this person before). 
He is also super funny and quirky. He has a cute/awkward sense of humor that lightens the mood in class and contributes to the previously discussed open environment. Our class had lots of laughs. I never felt bored or sleepy in this course, and I feel sleepy in lots of classes I take, even ones I really love. 
Prof. R is also great in office hours -- he was always willing to meet us outside of his regularly scheduled office hours, and he really helped me develop my ideas on the texts and think about what I was writing and how I was writing it. There aren't that many courses that really help one develop one's writing style (makes sense, as most lectures/seminars involve a series of 2-3 papers without revisions, some seminars just involve a final paper, etc.) but I really felt like Prof. R pushed us to be the best writers we could be. 
-- More on the course/grading:
The syllabus was pretty great. There were some texts I had never heard of and there were some I had read previously. Similarly, there were some texts I LOVED and some that I could barely get through. What was different about this course's syllabus (in my opinion) is that in a lot of other courses you can take in the English dept., especially those that are focused on older time periods (Renaissance, Victorian, etc.) or those that are not focused on a very specific topic (e.g. 19th Century European Literature) the entire syllabus can easily be stuff you've read before or at the very least heard of. This syllabus, I think in part b/c of the focused topic and spread out time period, had stuff that was completely unexpected. Just to give some examples, we read stuff like Bartleby, White Noise, Death of a Salesman, Glengarry Glen Ross, etc. Some weirder shit: Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, Day of the Locust. Like I said, I didn't love all of it, but I definitely learned a lot about -- you guessed it -- American Literature and Corporate Culture through all of the texts.
Prof. R did a great job of pairing the texts with secondary readings (theory, criticism, etc.). We spent quite a bit of time talking about some big topics like commodity fetishism which I am sure will come in handy later. Be warned, there is a ton of reading for the course and it gets overwhelming toward midterm & final seasons, but Prof. R was cognizant of that and cut the last book off our syllabus which definitely saved my ass. 
Grading was tough, but again, I think I really became a better writer and was thinking more about everything I was writing and whether or not my sentences and paragraphs made sense. Prof. R gave out a bunch of handouts for writing techniques before each paper just to get us thinking about different ways we could approach not only each paper topic but each sentence and paragraph within our papers. Super, super helpful. I also personally thought he was generous in final grades -- it's not often in English classes that the prof will round up. 
-- Things that would have made the class EVEN BETTER!: 
We were almost always behind, which was a function of not enough class time (2h/wk, standard), a lot of reading we had due for each week's class, and going off topic. More focused discussion would have been helpful, but the flexibility of the discussion I think is partially what encouraged people to speak (-- even those who were behind on reading could contribute). Nearly every week there was a class presentation on the reading. These could often take a while and they weren't always super helpful, so I think to counter the running-out-of-class-time these presentations could be shorter and more focused. Additionally, we got better with it as the semester went on, I think, but not spending too much time getting sidetracked on other interesting but less relevant discussions.
The only other thing is that for the texts I didn't really understand, class discussion didn't always help me understand. Prof. R is great at helping clarify the secondary material, and we also had some fascinating discussions on the themes of each text. I understand many of the themes in the different texts and themes of corporate culture in American literature very well, so I would say the course fulfilled its goals 110% here. But, there were texts I still didn't completely understand, like Bartleby and Day of the Locust, so even just spending time discussing the actual point of these texts would have been helpful for me. Prof was good at addressing this in office hours, though.

AVOID THIS CLASS AT ALL COSTS!!!!!! AVOID! AVOID! TURN AROUND! 
If someone tells you this class is NOT THAT BAD, THEY ARE BULLSHITTING YOU. I like probably everyone else in this class figured it'd be worth the sacrifice to knock an Econ elective and a Global Core out with the same course, and how bad could it be?
Answer: really fucking bad.
This class was an exercise in torture, honestly. Prof. Lincoln is actually quite a nice guy, approachable, knowledgeable, but lectures are a fucking PAIN IN THE ASS. 8:40 am and you have to haul ass to Mudd, only to watch the prof read off his lectures and summarize the readings (so don't bother doing them) and contribute nothing that makes the lecture itself worth going to. And worse: he passes around an attendance sheet. Better hope you have a decent number of friends in the class so you can share the sign in process and never attend more than say 5 lectures total. I've always thought profs who pass around sign in sheets are too lazy to make their lectures worth going to -- I only skip classes that aren't actually helpful with the course material; I never skip lectures that are enjoyable or actually help me understand the material beyond my just reading the textbook/lecture notes on my own time -- and this course is a PERFECT EXAMPLE of this.
The exams are hard -- entirely open-ended questions in which you need to write certain terms in the answers to receive credit, or remember not just the specifics about what happened but what specific economists say about events (for example, easily could see a qu that is like, what did X economist think caused Y event; and the next qu would be, what did Z economist think about the same Y event), and partial credit is virtually nonexistent. The tests are based entirely on memorization -- of Japan's entire economic history from like the year 1600 to the present, AND what economists think about it!
Bulk of your grade comes from a final paper that everyone pretty much writes two days before it's due. You can pick any topic you want, as long as it's related to the course in some way, essentially. It's a good experience (especially in preparation of writing an Econ seminar paper) since no other Econ class I've ever taken/heard of requires a 3000 word analytical paper. But like everything else in this course, it'll blindside you. I skipped class for weeks and weeks and then had to pull an all nighter for the midterm, promised myself it wouldn't happen again, but it happened again for the paper and then for the final. That is all definitely my fault, but if the lectures/teaching had been worthwhile at all I wouldn't have felt like i was learning an entire country's history in a night before each exam. 
Also prof is just weird. Collected all the final papers on the last day of class (as in like December 7) and said we wouldn't be getting our final grades until ""after January 7"" because he was ""going home to DC to spend time with his family."" The TAs proctored and graded the final exams I am pretty sure and did a first read on all the papers. He commutes from DC for lecture every week so I doubly don't understand why it is that early in the morning, and he only holds office hours immediately before/after class.
This class was literally the bane of my existence this past semester. If you're convinced you want to take it, don't take it as a senior. By the third week of class I didn't even bother pretending I would try to show up for Thursday morning lectures. Many thanks to all my friends in the course who signed me in at least once (or in some cases over and over again) -- I owe you a meal.

Banu. Banu. Banu. The best and worst teacher you will ever have. 
Note: She will most likely not be able to run her class the same way. The department will probably make her grade differently. Unless someone tried really really hard, I doubt there were any Bs in her class. 
But for our class, which was her first class at Columbia, it was beautiful. Two midterms and a final, but she will drop your lowest out of the three. Our first two midterms were take-home, with extra credit, and many questions copied right from the book. Most of the class did not even go to the final. Homework also easy and mostly from the book with lots of extra credit. Annoying group project at the end but if you showed even the slightest amount of effort (turning in a draft), you were set. EASY EASY EASY. This class helped my GPA incredibly. 
For the downside, you will not learn any Stat. We spent the first month and a half on chapters 1-2. So she was stuck ""teaching"" the really difficult material incredibly quickly. (Today class, we will do chapters 5,6, and 7). Because of her grading policy, no one bothered to learn anything after the midterms. And since they were take home midterms, no one bothered to learn anything anyways. You're screwed for econometrics.

Professor Schulz is a really adorable old lady but after one semester with her, i have absolutely no patience for her. Her classes are extremely boring and she doesn't really have a method of teaching. She really just reads from the textbook (which she wrote) and makes you memorize stuff. We had vocal quizzes almost every day which ended up not counting for much but were just a pain to constantly have to study for. I previously had Professor Song as a teacher before the intermediate class and comparing the two, its obvious that Song is more prepared and helps her students learn more effectively.

Dr. Elliott is super nice, generous, and always tries her best to help out her students. She's very helpful during office hours and always sits down with you to patiently work out your questions. I would also say she's a pretty lenient grader. I really enjoyed my individual, one-on-one interactions with her. That being said, I came out of the discussion sections usually feeling bored, confused, or frustrated. Dr. Elliott is not the most riveting lecturer, her voice bordering on monotonous, and I would often find myself zoning out or falling asleep. She is quite a reticent person, and that made it look like she lacked confidence in herself and the material she was presenting (except for the neuroscience unit, which is her area of specialty). I don't think she actually didn't know what she was talking about because she does seem quite smart, but her hesitance definitely did not clarify which information we needed to know most and encouraged an awkwardly silent atmosphere. Then she would halfheartedly call on people to participate, which led to even more halfhearted responses from the students. Sometimes it could get pretty miserable.
I feel bad talking shit about her because I could tell she was trying her best to make the class worth our time, and I really appreciate the fact that she brought us bagels for breakfast on the last day of class. Clearly she cares about her students and wants to see them succeed. However, I would advise you to switch sections if you get placed into her class. There are many other frosci instructors who will make your discussion sections much more interesting and still be helpful outside of class.

Professor Berne and TA Matt made a great team and made Physical Chemistry a relatively painless experience.  I really enjoyed learning the material for this class, but be warned, the textbook (though necessary to read) is riddled with errors.  Also, make sure to review the basic techniques of differentiation and integration.  You will need calculus for this class!
Professor Berne is hilarious and does not deserve the poor reviews he has received.  He truly loves the subject matter, makes himself available after class and during office hours for questions, and really does respond to student feedback.  Sure, he makes some mistakes on the board but he corrects them when someone informs him and as long as you are proactive and paying attention, the occasional mistake shouldn't be detrimental to your understanding of the material.
Please, please go to class.  There was a contingent of students who showed up to the final and I swear I had never seen some of them before.  Even though Matt posted his notes online, Berne is entertaining and his explanations are often very good.

Stephane is awesome. 
He really encourages every student to throw in his/her opinion, no matter how contradictory/unconventional. Therefore, he pushes the discussion deeper because it is more lively, more controversial, more honest. Even though he does spend some time lecturing (which is good, because it gives you a basis for the reflection), he also emphasizes discussions, from which he almost disappears (until it is time to be put back on track).
What is great about Stephane is that he is 100% honest: he'll tell you when he forgets his notes (which practically never happens), and he'll tell you when he doesn't like a book in particular. He understands that we are human and is therefore super chill about the reading (if you don't read a book in time, you're just hurting yourself by not being able to participate in class, but he won't make a fuss at all). 
This honesty can be a little harsh in his grading: his comments are not tender (quite sassy actually), but his intentions are solely good. He really does want the students to progress and he does so by pointing out their flaws. He genuinely reads the students' papers and gives personal advice to each and every one of them. He's also really great about office hours and is overall a super approachable person. He is the kind of professor who will take time to talk to you , to joke around and to get some news even when the course is over. As a whole,the class was delightful: I felt like our opinions were valued, therefore the class was a breeze. Also, Stephane made an effort to relate every work to common concepts and phenomena. I think he did a great job in giving details for each book, even though Lithum is really a fast survey course. 
Workload:

- Before each class, he posted 3 prompts on Courseworks' Discussion Board: 3 students had to write a 500-word response and all the other students had to comment with 250 words. Even though it is  great way of engaging with other students and making sure that the readings are done in time, it became kind of sloppy towards the end of the semester, when people were posting responses after midnight, the day of class..

Let's nuance these reviews... Xin Wan is not a ""terrible"" professor. 
He's a nice, young guy who certainly is not a good lecturer, but does have good intentions. During class, he would skip steps in problems and write notes quite fast, but he would gladly pause to answer any questions (he actually asks specifically if we have any questions at the end of each example/problem/demonstration). However, I must admit that his goodwill won't always answer the question and most often you'll have to resort to other students or to the textbook to understand entirely. It's true that a lot of the work will have to be done on your own (mainly going through the notes again after class and reading the entire chapter and practising the examples in the textbook). Prof. Wan takes almost all of his problems on the midterms/final from the textbook so honestly it's not that hard once, you understand the concept...
which is why I would encourage you to take Xin Wan's class if you are already slightly familiar with the concepts covered in Calculus II. If these are totally foreign to you, then the class might be harder, preciely because Prof. Wan has a hard time giving abstract definitions and introductory notions (the basics). 
If you're familiar with Calculus II concepts, then th class will actually be quite easy. Prof. Wan is an understanding person who will honestly admit that the examples/demonstrations he does in class are much harder than the problems that will be on the final. 
The weekly homework is about the same level of difficulty as what is on the exams. 
Overall, I would encourage you to take Wan's class if you don't want to spend your entire week doing calc (the worload is really light) and if you're already slightly familiar with Calc ii concepts.

Oh god, this class and this professor were awful. I couldn't agree more with the reviewer below me. This class was first of all so incredibly boring; he took the least interesting aspects of studying Israel and turned it into a course. The readings were average length but just so incredibly boring. I only read them when I had to write a paper for them. Professor Cohen is just not a nice person at all. Every time I emailed him with a question or approached him after class, he was always so unnecessarily snide. He's really just an unkind person and shuts down any opinions that contradict his, which is probably because a large part of the readings we had were his own or his colleagues'. The way he speaks to his students both in private and in class is nasty and he seems to have no passion for teaching at all. He puts up the same powerpoint every class and goes off on tangents about uninteresting and irrelevant things. Like the previous commenter mentioned, he expects you to know a great deal about the subject of the class before you take it, so if you have no background in the topic of the class, I would either be prepared to read a few books on the topic or choose another class. I would strongly recommend the latter. 
Maybe it was because this isn't my area of study, and I only took this class pass/fail for pleasure because I thought it would be interesting especially in light of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, but I thought this class and the readings were mind numbingly boring.

I took Tyerman's FYE Madness class. It was amazing. He is amazing. He's part of the Slavic Department and from what I understood his PhD work is on the relationship between China and Russia. Talk about madness. While I'm not sure he'll teach this seminar again, I can still talk to his teaching ability. Professor Tyerman cares about his student and the subject he's teaching. He gave a huge variety of texts to read- from Shakespeare to One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest to Chinese and Russian short stories. In addition, we watched films such as Solaris and Vertigo. 
Class discussions consisted of Professor Tyerman asking a broad question and allowing students to answer and articulate ideas. If a student had difficulty speaking, Professor Tyerman would reiterate back to the student and the class what the student had tried to say and ask if that was correct. He never stepped on a student's ideas or opinions, only asking more questions so students could better formulate what they were thinking. The only issue I found is that sometimes Professor Tyerman can be too nice, but perhaps this is because I had an extremely mean English teacher in high school. I once had made a comment in class and Professor Tyerman didn't agree and said so. I did not feel that it was mean, embarrassing or anything negative- he just didn't agree. He ended up writing me an email to say that he didn't mean to not listen to my ideas. He wants students to feel comfortable expressing themselves and definitely came across!
Essays were graded twice -first a rough draft. I thought he was always completely fair in his comments and grades. He would tell you what needs to be more clarified or supported, or perhaps your argument just didn't make sense. As long as you followed his comments and suggestions, you would get a higher grade.
Office hours were not only helpful, but fun. Professor Tyerman is genuinely interested in what you have to say and in what you think. I went several times to his OH asking questions about class discussions, potential essay topics, and first drafts. He answered my questions directly, but also posed questions about my ideas and thoughts, forcing me to actually, really think about what I wanted to say and not what I thought he wanted me to say.
In addition, since I had attended so many OH, I asked Professor Tyerman to be a reference for an internship I was applying for. He happily agreed and after I got the job, he asked me about my work and how things we going there. He really, truly cares.
I have no interest whatsoever in Slavic Studies, but I will without a doubt take another class with Professor Tyerman even if the subject does not interest me, because I know Professor Tyerman will engage me in class and I will end up caring since he does.

Calc II is just not easy, and that's no fault of Professor Altug's. That's just what the material is like, and since there's so much of it, the class has to be fast-paced. Professor Altug gives many and very clear examples of whatever he's teaching. He goes through them superquick and often I wouldn't be able to understand them in class, but if you write them down and look at them when doing Problem Sets it'll make better sense. Professor Altug also encourages questions in class and will often stop and ask if everyone understands - but when you're in a room with highly motivated engineering students (and I am not one of them- go Barnard!), it's extremely scary to ask a question in fear you'll look stupid, so I never did.
Also, he does not allow homework questions during office hours which is probably because everyone would then show up. I went once, only to ask about his thoughts on possibly doing the 3-2 engineering program, and while he didn't know much about it we still had a pleasant little talk about engineering.
Exams were extremely difficult. This is what I hated most about the class, since I felt exam questions never reflected the questions given in class or on Problem Sets.
Also if you did have a question on homework, you would have to to the Math Help Room which was not helpful and never had TAs.
All in all, I actually thought I would fail this class and considered withdrawing. I failed one of the midterms, but I ended up getting a C in the class, which is a miracle. My bad grade isn't a reflection on Professor Altug, it's a reflection on my inability to to do Calc II.
I also want to add that if you are an incoming first-year and tested out of Calc I with AP Calc AB, you really should retake Calc I here. Apparently this is common advice that I failed to receive until a week before the final.

Prof Doubleday is a genuinely nice enough professor--if you understand organic chemistry. If you don't get it, he tries, but the level of impatience escalates exponentially; and then he's pretty much useless (particularly as the class progresses) because he cannot seem to explain things on a level other than for the A student. I have seen it happen to people. And, let's face it, we aren't all gifted in the same way. But, I'm sure if you are here you have your gifts. So I'm celebrating them by telling you be sure you need to take Organic Chemistry before you take it. It's not just for shits and giggles. 
If you are one of those who likes to cram for exams, well this is not the class to take. In fact, don't take Organic Chemistry at all. Just move on to something you're passionate about. You'll be A LOT happier, and anyway, as interesting as Organic Chemistry is, it really isn't for the tangential polymath. You can't merely just be ""interested,"" sadly.
His first exam was a piece of cake. (See stats of previous review as they are accurate.) The second exam probably shocked most people as being significantly harder than the first. The third exam is about the same as the second. And the final was just ridiculously and unnecessarily long and tricky for no good reason; not to mention repetitive. I cannot fathom why this final exam had to be 15 pages long. Maybe to compete with Cornish's? I heard her exam was even longer. Regardless, I was bored to tears and pissed off because I had another exam to take; and I was sleepy and petulant by the end.
The work load, I feel, is heavy. Some geniuses might disagree. I also feel that he spends too much time on beginning concepts and not enough time on synthesis/mechanism stuff, which is where the class begins to fall apart in my humble (well maybe not so humble) opinion.
Doubleday is grandfatherly in his teaching style in class, which I found endearing. He also spends more time outside of class helping students than any other professor in the sciences (besides my physics professor: Humensky and Schaevitz). As the class progressed his lectures got a little bit more scatter-brained, and he starts to talk to himself and laugh directly at the blackboard without paying any attention to us. It's some sort of angel and devil on the shoulders dispute he has going on, which can be humorous at first, but gets very old and annoying particularly if the concept at hand is difficult and requires careful and focused delivery.
Bottom line: Doubleday is likable, and in fact, lovable if you're doing well. If you're not I'm sure you will find him annoying and you will complain about everything in the class--from his kowtowing to the textbook, to his overt internal dialogue, to his exams, to his office hours where all the sycophants gather weekly like hens to the roost. But maybe you'd find any professor annoying if you weren't doing well. You'll really have to soul search for the answer to this. I can be of no help there.
A word about the TAs: All TAs as you know are not created equal. This class was insanely unfair because of it. One TA gave her students plenty of help (via handouts and extra problems). The other did nothing of the sort, and was a poor lecturer. The quizzes were easy if you just read the notes again and did a few problems. I'd like to see statistically how the students faired in the class overall by TA. But that will probably never be allowed to happen at CU because they have a stick up their asses about grading and policy and an ballooned ego the size of the Hindenburg.

I am rather tardy to the party here in my review of Prof Casti's teaching chops. I took his Calculus 1 class, summer 2013. I write this because I think BY FAR Casti's class is the best I have had at CU. Mowch's Bio class lectures were good, but her exams are unfair compared to Casti's. He isn't personalizing the course to such an extent that it leaves out students who do not approach learning the way he does. This is not the case with Mowsch. Its her way or the highway. But, I digress....
I'm now about to finish my postbac premed courses, and well, Casti still takes first place. Mind you, I hear there are great profs to be had if you are at CU proper and taking the Core classes. Sadly, I am one of those people you see at the airport running to catch a red-eye with one foot wedged in the closing airbus door. My life has been one of so much curiosity that I find that career-wise, in the world we live in, I must now get serious, and hence, I am an older student with no time to take the classes I would really like to take from the utterly riveting profs out there, which I enviably here exist. I'm treating my time here as a sort of technical school; so I can make enough money to write my poetry. May I not be struck by lighting for this.
Now about Casti: everything is written out on the chalkboard. So unless you are asleep (which you cannot be because he's very animated, funny, and engaging), or have some sort of deficiency (hand-eye coordination, broken arm, personal calamity, etc.) there should be no problem keeping up with his lecture, which is crystalline in its directness, authenticity, accuracy, and detail. He is very generous of heart. How can anyone not appreciate that?! The man is sweating through his shirt every lecture because of the effort of writing across the board all class period. He does this because he believes this is the best and only way to truly learn calculus. There is no Powerpoint slide. He isn't lazy in any sense of the word. His exams are fair. If you did the homework and understood his emphasized concept in his lectures you should get an ""A"" in this course. There really is no reason not to, because believe me when I say that this isn't my forte; and if I can do it, you certainly can. It is possible to get a 100 on his exams. This does not mean the class is easy. Please don't misconstrue what I am saying here. You have to work for the A, but this you should know from being at CU, no?
I didn't have to read the book. In fact, I would have stopped after Chapter 2, but I'm way too uptight for that. So I gave the book a cursory nod, reread my notes a couple of times and redid a few key problems (which will become apparent to you after rereading the notes and having done them once prior). You must do the homework to do well. All of it. 
Casti really knows his calculus backwards and forwards, and I understood everything he gave in class just from his explanation and my notes of his lectures. If I needed clarification, I stayed after class and asked. This is a professor with a plan. He knows exactly what he's going to do each day, and it gets done efficiently. You are expected to participate; shy people you will just have to get over it, and you egotistical lot (myself, sometimes included here), you will have to check yours at the door. Looking stupid or giving a wrong answer means nothing to this professor. He has your best interest at heart, and you will never be made a fool of. He simply is too down-to-earth for that sort of pompous lack of generosity.
The final is cumulative. But so is his review session. He gives extra time on the exams. It's not about rushing through and getting it wrong. He isn't trying to trick you. He's a very reasonable person.

I took Art Hum with Tina as a freshman last year, and I consider myself really lucky to have had her as a professor. While it seems that some reviewers don't share my opinion, I can only speak of my own experience, which was excellent to say the least. 
That said, I won't argue that there are probably easier art hum teachers out there who won't push you to delve into the material like Tina does. She is a serious art historian and is fully prepared to offer a wealth of knowledge about the subject, for those who are willing to listen. As an economics major who may never again step foot in another art history or related course, I think it will carry some weight when I say that this was one of the most valuable classes I have ever taken. I say this because having taken art hum with Tina I now feel comfortable approaching works of art that before, would have intimidated me. Taking her class will give you the tools to interpret and unpack any work of art - from the Parthenon, to Pollock. She will teach you that art is not made for memorization, and that approaching art with curiosity and persistence can grant you a remarkable sense of understanding. 
Part of the reason I chose Columbia was for the unique opportunity that the Core presents - namely, the opportunity to learn about Western art and culture in a way that will be advantageous for years to come. And, I think many will agree that this was a big part of their decision, and that this is what the Core Curriculum is all about. The goal isn't, and shouldn't be, to pick up an easy A or to snooze through a semester of lectures. The goal is to walk away with a more complete and meaningful outlook, in this case with respect to art. 
In sum, I can confidently attest that learning about art and how to approach it from Tina has been one of the highlights of my time at Columbia so far. As with many things in life and especially the Core, this class and all of the things you can take away from it are fully dependent on how much you are willing to put in. Should you be so lucky as to have Tina as a professor in any capacity, I hope you will jump at the chance to learn from her a new way of looking at the art around you.

Very reasonable. There were weekly readings that she would go over in class, and the examinations were straightforward. In my class, we did final presentations (subject matter of our choice) at the end of the semester. There were also multiple trips to museums, during which we chose topics for our papers. She was always more than willing to talk about papers, even over email if you couldn't make it to her office hours.

I have to disagree with the previous two reviews as I feel like they are a bit too salty and biased. I had Heather for CC this past semester, and while I think she has plenty of weaknesses as a teacher, she has plenty of strengths as well. First, compared to other core teachers, she is in the middle of the pack. There are great teachers out there and shit teachers, I think she is neither, due to her young age she has the potential to be either. Heather is very rigid and clearly inexperienced as a teacher, and I think because of this she tries to impose too much authoritarianism on the classroom. She does prevent the discussions from being organic, but it is in the spirit of hearing everyone's voice. In short, Heather seems insecure about her authority and so choke-holds the class in an attempt to maintain it; put simply, she needs to chill. Now for the pros: Heather really cares, and she knows her shit--she isnt one of the CC professors who A) doesn't know what they are teaching or B) simply doesnt gaf, and this allows for some great discussions to take place, inorganic as they may be. Secondly, she wants her students to read the books, to engage in the discussions, and most importantly, to care; though some of her policies are pragmatically inept, they are well-intentioned, and a refinement of these policies will lead to her becoming a great teacher (looking at the quiz/grading style of midterms and the paper). Many people were upset by the quiz at the beginning on Plato and its brutal grading (along with the midterm and papers), though the grades seemed to be curved by the end--I think frustration of low grades angered students more than her actual teaching. If Heather relaxes, makes it clear that grades will probably be curved (or rather more clear what is expected and what will be given for types of work), but most importantly, chills out, she will make a great teacher. Contrary to a prior review, I don't understand how one would find her unintelligent--also, if you came to Columbia for the teachers, most of the good ones are reserved for the grad schools (refer to last year's Varsity Show- ""fuck the undergrads""

I had Alan for first semester Lit Hum. 
First off: Alan is completely brilliant, and knows all of the Lit Hum readings inside and out--not only in English, but in Latin and Greek as well.  This allows him to convey unique and interesting insights into everything from the Iliad to the Bible. Also, he always spends a part of class explaining useful Greek/Latin words and concepts, which adds a lot to the overall understanding of the course.  That being said, Alan is a misanthropic personality who allows his apathy to spill over into the classroom.  
With his knowledge, experience, and love of Greek literature, Alan could easily be one of the best Lit Hum professors at Columbia if he wanted to.  Instead, he chooses to show movies (which is fun, but ultimately a waste of time), discourage students from coming to office hours, rant about the uselessness of the Core, and ask students difficult existential questions before refuting or mocking their answers. When we read the Bible, Alan made a habit of calling out inconsistencies in the stories and doctrine.  This in itself was understandable, but he would also force the one self-identified Christian in the class to explain and defend contradictions that even a theology student might have had trouble understanding. This got to the point where it seemed like he was wasting class time just to try and ""logic"" her out of her religion, an activity that benefitted no one.  
If the point of Lit Hum is to turn Panglossian freshmen into cynics who suffer existential crises about the inevitability of death and can reference Euripides at the drop of a hat, then Alan succeeds admirably in his job. He pushes students to think about difficult topics and to question whether their deepest beliefs are blind dogma or legitimate ideologies.  In the process, however, he dismisses students' ideas and creates an environment in which the potential hazards of speaking up greatly outweigh any benefits. 
At the end of the semester, you WILL leave Alan's class having fully discussed, read, and analyzed the texts and broader thematic elements of the course. You will have a deeper understanding of some of the greatest literature in history and, as cliché as this sounds, yourself.  However, you will probably leave with an underwhelming grade, a new-found fear of voicing your opinions, and a hollow pit in your stomach that reminds you that, as Alan says, ""life it just the painful progression of mortality.""

Essays rarely receive good grades, and Alan takes points off for any ideas that he considers broad, general, or simply too pompous.

Saskia Sassen's class was perhaps one of the best I have taken in my three years on this campus.  While her lectures mirror her cornerstone ""Cities"" book (i.e. scattered at best) she does do a good job with reinforcing main concepts.  These concepts are stressed ad nauseum and are nearly impossible to misunderstand.  I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the guest speakers she brought in, which added nice real-world examples to the topics we were focusing on.  The TA's are all really nice and will help you out if you need direction or are having trouble understanding a concept.  Overall, this is a simple class that nearly guarantees an A in with minimal effort.  If you're looking for a global core or are simply interested in the subject, I'd highly recommend this course.

Silva is a man of strange and wonderful benevolence. I took this class to fulfill an English distribution requirement and while I can't say I enjoyed the material all that much, Silva himself was wonderful. He'll read your papers as many times as you want to write and revise them before the deadline, as long as you bring them to his office for him to read in person. You should definitely take advantage of this, because he will tell you exactly how to improve your writing and is quite charming to boot.
His exams are tricky. They're long and seem to defy studying in unexpected ways. But fret not, because his grading is mysteriously generous. I suspect that if he knows you and has some faith in your ability, then he will finagle the grades around to give you what he thinks you deserve, regardless of how the numbers fall. (This is another reason you should go to office hours.)

I took Professor Kimberley Johnson for URBS V1515, Introduction to Urban Studies. Professor Johnson is the chair of the interdisciplinary Urban Studies program (hosted at Barnard, but open to all Columbia College and General Studies undergrads as well), and is very knowledgeable on the subject. She kept lectures interesting with multimedia presentations, guest speakers, and a personal interest in the topic. At times the reading seemed overwhelming, but some of the readings were removed as the course progressed. Also, Professor Johnson was very good at succinctly reviewing the readings, so if there is something you didn't understand or get to, the lecture will fill in the blanks.  There were around 50 students in the class, so the discussion was limited, but Professor Johnson was always available after class or during office hours to discuss anything from the coursework to what other classes to take to pursuing Urban Studies as a major. Professor Johnson is not an easy grader (she apologized to the class for making the midterm more difficult than she had planned, then gave a final which was just as difficult), but there were opportunities for extra credit.

The texts were all right, but my experience was overall not so great. 
Prof. Ellsberg was consistently 5-10 minutes late, and a bit disorganized as well. She often went on long tangents that, while interesting, had nothing to do with the class. Consequently, we spent maybe 20 minutes per class actually discussing the reading, which was incredibly frustrating for me, and we were way behind schedule. Additionally, she often forgot whether she had handed back papers or not (usually the answer was no), and she never knew any of our deadlines (literally we'd all have our essays and ask whether she wanted them at the beginning or end of class, and she'd sometimes seem surprised that they were due that day).
She often made the class environment feel unsafe for several students of color, myself included (I have not discussed this subject with the white students in our class, but on some occasions they were quite vocal about disagreeing with some of the casually racist things she said). I honestly don't believe that she knew the impact of what she was saying, but sometimes what she said was totally inappropriate and quite offensive.
On the upside, she didn't penalize us for her disorganization and tendency to run behind, adjusting her syllabus as necessary to fit. Additionally, she gave good feedback on our essays--I do believe that my writing improved over the course of her class. We workshopped several papers in class, with Prof. Ellsberg explaining her reasoning for making changes and often having us suggest changes by the end of the term, so we could do the same thing on our own as we wrote our papers.
She also had us take field trips to various museums around NYC on our own time, which I really liked.

Professor Fogg is very approachable. He truly means well and will help in any possible capacity. He appears to be a man of infinite patience; a necessary virtue in anyone that listens to music created before the 20th century. It's also not a virtue many people have in spades, so yes, his class certainly felt boring. I personally enjoyed it, but I'll never forget the walls of silence in that room. I suspect a combination of inexperience (from both teacher and student) and brutal heat were the cause. This was a summer course, and to be fair, it was hard to hear over that AC. So off it remained.
There was a 5 minute presentation you had to complete about a piece of your choosing, at a time of your scheduling. The midterm and final were challenging. Roughly a third of the grade was based on your ability to listen to a piece and identify its period, composer, and title. Definitely not something you can wing. You also had to attend a performance by any artist and write a 5-page review using your newfound knowledge. I had fun with that. You could pretty much see whoever you wanted as long as you had something to write about.
Honestly, Music Humanities isn't very enthralling subject matter, unless you're already into it. I can only see Professor Fogg improving with time, assuming he continues teaching.

Ronald Neath is the best Statistics professor I have ever had at Columbia  (unfortunately there isn't much competition). He came in excited and energetic everyday and was a clear and thorough lecturer. During class he would take notes on the board and later he would post handouts that would help us complete the homework assignments. Take him if you can!

Workload:
Very reasonable. 7 assignments, all requiring R programming. Typically he would explain how to do any difficult questions the class before it was due. Midterms were multiple choice with some short answers and covered only material we learned. 10/10 would take again.

There are lots of great reasons to take this course. First, Professor Saskia Sassen is brilliant, and basically created her own field of study of which she is the expert. It's a terrific experience to sit in class and listen to her speak, even if she gets off track sometimes.  Her tangents are better than most professors' planned lectures. She's also incredible nice, very available for office hours, and interested in anyone who takes an interest in her work.  Second, it counts towards the Global Core, and third the workload is very manageable.  There are few required readings beyond selections from Professor Sassen's own book, instead students are suggested to pick one or two other readings each week and focus on understanding those instead of reading a lot and not comprehending it.  As a result, each student has some control as to what areas of Global Urbanism they focus on.  Grades are 50% on the take home midterm, 50% on the take home final.  Attendance is not taken, nor factored into your grade.  Both exams are two questions, each question requiring a 4-page response. Like in the readings, students have a lot of leeway as to what they want to write about in response to each question.  You'll get as much out of this course as you chose to put into it.

I took this class with Ricardo last term and wanted to give him some love since it seems like a lot of it is going to Xavier!  I learned a lot in this class without too much stress, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a more broad introduction to macroeconomics than what Xavier does.  
Ricardo organizes his lectures into weeks of different topics (13 weeks total) covering unemployment, inflation, growth theory, fiscal policy, monetary policy, and more, and the models behind each of them.  You don't need to know a lot of math for this class at all, though sometimes it helps in understanding the models.
Ricardo's lectures slides are very useful - definitely print them out and take notes on them in class (or do it on a computer).  Sometimes I didn't fully understand what he was saying during class, but when I did the problem sets and reviewed the notes everything cleared up.  At times he may seem like he's going too quickly (probably because he's just so brilliant) but I just wrote everything down and reviewed it one more time and it usually clicked.
Recitations weren't super useful - I was planning on going to most of them but then ended up not going to many because of conflicts or sheer laziness, and found that Ricardo's notes are enough.  But when I did go, they cleared things up and I think it's a great way to catch up if you're behind in class (shoutout to the awesome TAs Savi, Oscar, Jiawen! All three of them were great).
I learned quite a bit and in the end felt like I really grasped the basics of each of the topics he covered.  He likes to give real world examples of all the topics, which made me feel like I also learned a bit more about the economics of the world in general.  This is a great foundation class - plus Ricardo is really nice, flexible with scheduling office hours, and is very approachable despite being a genius!
Oh, and, he has a dazzling smile. Seriously. If given the option I would choose Ricardo again in a heartbeat.
Workload:
20% problem sets: 10 problem sets total, weekly (with a couple exceptions like before midterms). I thought they were pretty straightforward and it didn't take me very long to complete them.  Working with others definitely helps, but make sure you understand the problems since his midterm and final questions are similar.
30% Midterm (learn how to budget your limited time/do questions quickly)

A great professor for CC, and I was lucky to have him for a term.  He's very knowledgable about a lot of the books, and I especially loved our classes on Hobbes and Locke (he is less knowledgeable about Al Ghazali and the Qur'an).
He is full of himself and he knows it, and he tells us the most interesting, sometimes hilarious stories about his life.  My biggest complaint would be that sometimes he would follow a student's point on a tangent for a very long time and it frustrated me that it seemed like we'd gotten nowhere, really.  But generally he was able to keep conversations interesting and focused on the stuff that he prepared.
The essays are graded fairly.  He likes for you to be succint and not include lots of fluff.  Every sentence should have a purpose in the essay.  It's great to learn to write like this.  The essay prompts are short, just a couple of sentences each, all based on the texts.  But they are not often straightforward, and for CC essays you really should think through your points before starting to write. They are on the short end (1200-1500 words).
If you have him for your professor, I would definitely keep the class!  I certainly had a great CC experience.

I was skeptical of Ronald at the beginning but I grew to like him. Don't be thrown off if you do poorly on the first homework (he says he's a tough grader) but once you get used to his style and the sort of details you need to include, it's doable to get almost full credit on every homework after that. 
I've HATED every stats prof I had before this (1211, 3105,3107) and I finally started to appreciate Ronald as a breath of fresh air (Tests that actually reflect the homework we do! The average is not 50%! Wow!). He was receptive to homework questions over email and I felt comfortable asking clarification questions during class. He followed the textbook which was pretty good for concepts so definitely don't get too behind on the readings (He likes True/False questions and the book is really helpful for those!). He is open to not including highly computational chapters on tests (like matrices or stuff that can't really be done outside R) but you have to push him a little to explicitly say something will not be covered or emphasized beyond basic concepts. 
R is an easy program to use, and homeworks are 100% doable on your own (also refreshing, as I felt like I couldn't get through 3105/3107 without looking most answers up on Chegg). Ronald goes through examples in class that help a lot with homework (again, what a luxury in the stats department...). 
Also, he had soft deadlines on homework, which was pretty awesome if you were stuck on a particular problem or had to focus on another class that week. 
I did average on the 1st midterm, above average on the 2nd, got around 95% on homeworks after the 1st one, and I'm guessing average/above average on final and got an A (my first as a stats major).

Final: A LOT of T/F ( around 75%) and only 2 short answer. If you've done every HW yourself and read the book well, you should understand the concepts enough to do fine on T/F.

I would not recommend this class at all. Although I initially thought Professor Muir was an engaging professor and interesting person, my thoughts quickly changed. She requires a lot of weekly reading, which seemed redundant immediately because she would lecture about what we read the next day in class. Unfortunately, Professor Muir does not encourage her students to think by themselves, but rather encourages reiteration and regurgitation of the thoughts of the authors that we read as well as her own. During lecture, she tended to repeat the same sentence four or five times just in a different way, which was not only frustrating but also pointless and made the class seem insignificant and (again) redundant.
What I found most irritating about this class and the professor, unfortunately, was the lectures seemed superficial and overwhelmingly pretentious. Since the material of the course is extremely interesting and engaging, I do not discourage anyone from taking this course with another professor, but certainly suggest NOT TAKING THE COURSE WITH PROFESSOR MUIR. You will undoubtedly be disappointed.

Take Hansen's Calculus I course - you won't be disappointed. He's friendly, concise, precise, smart, good-looking, and all that but above all he's a truly good lecturer. Most of the time, he's done with lecture a little early even after always encouraging questions from students in the class. He speaks and writes fast, but never to the point where you can't follow, and you will almost always leave the class actually UNDERSTANDING the material - which I quickly discovered is rarely the case with most other professors in this Ivy institution. He always comes into the class with full command of the material and gives you just enough - never too much or too little.
Dave's method is intuitive - a good mix of visuals and proofs. I sat in a few other sections prior to settling on this one, but it was only in Dave's where I felt like I was following the whole class. But the real success of his methods is probably the wealth of examples he goes through in class. They usually progress from simple to quite complicated, but this really helps you understand the materials because he's putting you in his shoes. 
Homework is quite straightforward and he's always willing to help during office hours or after class. Right before the midterm, he will post sample midterms and generally you'll glean a couple clues about how to go about the midterms from the sample. 
All in all, I was really pleased - I never took Calc before but he was such a good instructor and I got an A. He makes you want to do well and doesn't turn your life into a nightmare. Take his class already!

I am going to be very honest. This class is probably the worst one I've had so far at Columbia. He seemed to know a lot about consulting, but terrible at conveying it to us. His lecturing style was unclear. Lectures consist of him talking vaguely about various topics. There were a bunch of required textbooks which most students bought, but ended up not reading at all because class projects did not really require us to know knowledge from them. He seemed to be very nice and gave all of us so many compliments.
Also, he is terrible at using courseworks. He uploaded a ppt including every team's grade in the assignment tab of courseworks.
After that, he did not bother to upload anymore. Instead, he sent these grades via e-mail when he was asked to do so.
What I expected when I decided to take this class was learning knowledge specific in the consulting industry as well as skills to find a job in consulting. But, all I got was 4 consulting projects and teams spend all class time working on the projects and he comes to all the teams and listen to our concerns and questions for 5 minutes. The worst part was that even if you get team members who just do not care to show up in meetings, you are still going to get the same grade as that person because this instructor does not use peer evaluation when grading.

I really don't think the class is worth the money and time. But, if you want to take a class where you can easily get a B, go for it.

      Lara was the best Spanish teacher I have had since I started at Columbia. I absolutely suck at Spanish and in other classes with native speaker teachers I felt a lot less comfortable speaking Spanish. She is very encouraging and worked on the things the class actually had problems with. She managed to correct many of the basic problems that had been overlooked by my previous 2 professors. Her class was the most comfortable I have felt speaking Spanish because she does not correct you every time you make the slightest mistake like the native speakers tend to. If you are struggling at Spanish or learning it for the first time I highly recommend taking her class.

If you check your SSOL and Eliza's name comes up, congrats! You got into the good section. Exhale. Relax. Forget about switching around your schedule and pushing off Art Hum -- yet again -- because you've struck gold this time. Let me break it down for you...
First, her teaching style... Eliza leads discussions really well. She lets class discussion flow naturally, but at the same time leads it along with her slides and keeps it moving. She was really good at getting everyone to participate (and as someone who participates often, it was not ever in an annoying or forced way that slows discussion down). She is excellent at taking what a student says and fleshing it out, making it more nuanced and informative.
Second, her personality... As you will realize from the moment you meet her, she is one of the top five nicest people in the world (maybe top three even). She is really chill about late assignments, and she would probably let you hand in an essay a week late if your pet turtle had the flu. She's very accessible and easy to talk to.
Last, and what you've been waiting for, her grading... In my opinion, and I can't speak for everyone, Eliza grades pretty leniently. Like other Art Hum sections, you never need to do the readings (except when there's a response paper). However, if you put in a decent amount of time on the essays you should get an A on them, and if you spend 5 minutes studying for the exams you will be stellar -- just review your notes and memorize the dates/locations. Also, she grades so that even if you get a question wrong, if you justify it well you will get almost all the credit. At the end of the day, I had the feeling that if she knew you cared about the class and participated often in the discussions, you were guaranteed an A.
Overall, there is every reason to take this class. It's a good time, you learn a lot, and if you devote a few hours to the essays you're bound to get a decent grade.
Workload:
15% Participation (including response papers): There are 4 one-page response papers due throughout the semester. These are graded on a check-scale, so it's pretty chill and she doesn't care if you hand it in late.
15% Paper I: Public Sculpture: 4-5 page paper comparing two sculptures on campus.

I always said that the main reason I wanted to come to Columbia was for the incredible professors, but even then, I couldn't have imagined the privelege of having such an incredible teacher as Professor Mercer. Everyone I spoke to in the class worshipped her, and, as many often said, hoped ""to one day become half the person professor Mercer is"". She was funny, charming, and highly encapturing. Anyone could tell that she was thoroughly passionate about her work, as well as about the general state of affairs at Columbia. I can honestly say that Professor Mercer changed the way I see the world through her lectures on oppression, power, change, etc. Take this class, any class, with Professor Mercer if you can. It will be one of your best experiences at Columbia, guaranteed. 
Workload:
Not too much. 3 essays. The first two are one page single-spaced (though dense), and the third is 3-4 double spaced. There is a final, which was graded very fairly.

I really enjoyed Stat ML with Cunningham. Having taken COMS 4771 Machine Learning with Pe'er, I think Cunningham's class was clearly superior. His lecture style was, in my opinion, really good. He was primarily working off slides (posted online at the beginning of the semester). He supplemented it with the blackboard for equations and graphs, which I found to be a good mix. At least on Fall 2014 he was lecturing based on Orbanz' excellent slides (with some updates, I think), so if you see those online you'll get a sense of what the class will look like.
Content wise, we covered some basic statistical review, including MLE, risk and loss; then linear classification with perceptron, leading to SVM; we then side stepped to discuss optimization techniques; then generalizing SVM with multiclass and kernels; then discussed trees, boosting, bagging, and random forest for classification. Then we had the midterm on all that. Post midterm we did regression, with a review of linear algebra and eigenvectors, which led to shirnkage with ridge and LASSO; then to usupervised learning with PCA and clustering (kmeans and EM). Then an unrelated feeling, but interesting, discussion on information theory. Finally crammed at the end was a discussion of Bayesian models. 
In contrast to 4771, there was MUCH less Bayes/graphical models. However, in exchange I felt like the coverage on everything else was MUCH better. 
Generally I found Cunningham emphasized the intuition and context behind ML techniques much more than other, similar, classes have. It really helped me understand how different techniques fit together, why you'd use them, and how you'd actually go about setting parameters, etc. There was some discussion about validating results and testing, which I think reflects the statistical approach of the class. If you want to go super, super heavy into deriving equations in lecture, I think 4771 is more your style.
Basically no assigned reading, but I think having Elements of Statistical Learning, and/or Murphy or Bishop was references can be quite helpful if you get to a subject you're either confused about, or interested in learning more about.
The TA, Ben Reddy, lectured about 3 times in Cunningham's place, and did a good job. He was helpful, but clearly overloaded and neither he nor Cunningham were especially responsive outside of lectures. Cunningham didn't offer standard office hours, for example. And the Piazza was very quiet, but they weren't especially responsive, either. The class needed at least another TA or two, in my opinion. 
Workload:
4 homeworks, which he posts. All involved coding up algorithms in R, and analyzing the results/performance/etc of the algorithm. Homeworks were clearly explained, and I found them pretty useful. It was a mix of using R packages (eg for SVM) and writing your own implementation of algorithms, eg for perceptron. They all had analytical/mathematical sections, but only the last one required much time or thought. Much lighter workload than COMS 4771.
Midterm + Final. Midterm was a bit rough (average ~65/100?), final wasn't as bad (maybe 80s?). Unfortunately the types of questions on the exams were totally unrelated to the homeworks and his hints/reviews about what might be on them.

This is for the flipped classroom in fall 2014. We were assigned small (10-15 person) sections, and each week had about 60-90 minutes of coursera videos to watch before hand. At the session he would spend 20 minutes recapping the key points from the videos, then maybe 30 minutes we'd be doing questions (very similar to the exam questions), and discussing the answers with him. Lots of opportunities to ask questions and talk with him, especially if you get a less crowded session. (Note that his original plan was that he'd only do 2 of every 3 weeks for each section, and a TA would do the other. However it seemed like he abandoned this after a while, and combined a few sessions so he could do all of them himself.)
I really enjoyed the format. Keeping up with the lectures before your session was a bit difficult when you have a million other things to do, but pretty important. I fell behind about 3/4ths through when we switched away from machine translation, and it took me a while to catch up again. It was also a little disappointing that you almost never saw who else was in the class, since a bit of discussion about the homework with other students was quite valuable. 
There is no textbook, but he has a set of classnotes online that's basically an alpha version of a textbook, along with the slides he used in the coursera video.
The biggest issue I had with the class was general non-responsiveness on Piazza. There were a LOT of questions about the assignments, and the TAs just generally didn't respond. The TA led discussion sections were also basically useless for me, although the TAs also seemed nice and were trying hard, they just weren't up to Collins' level. 
Workload:
5 homeworks. Each was split into an analytical and a coding section. The analytical weren't too bad, but the coding was quite time consuming. You had to implement certain algorithms to produce specific output. There were generally hundreds of tiny bugs you could make that would drive your performance on the task from like 91% to 3%, and it often felt like a bug hunting exercise. Starting early enough that you have an intelligent design for your system is highly recommended, since you'll generally iterate on part1 in part2. Each one was probably 10-20 hours of coding.
midterm + final, both of which were quite doable. However, the types of questions he asks are mostly of the ""do something with a toy grammar"" type that you're asked in the flipped classrooms. Which means that often understanding the bigger picture is less important that seeing the tricks in the toy examples. Still, with the flipped classroom exercises + cheat sheet, you should do ok on the exams.

Professor Kim was a great, engaging lecturer. She was clearly working hard to make sure everyone in the class understood the material, and showed a level of commitment to teaching that's unusual at Columbia.   She offered very clear and thorough explanations of topics. She took many questions during lecture, and answered them quite well. She was incredibly patient, including spending lots of time in office hours answering questions.
I didn't work with the TAs much, but they seemed to all be pretty decent, and were generally very responsive on piazza.
I felt like this class was the easiest in the CS core, along with CS Theory. However it was useful and I found it kind of fun. I would have actually appreciated slightly more workload, and slightly harder exams, since a tiny mistake could have cost you a lot given the structure.

The biggest benefit of Knox is that she's been teaching for a while, and she works at the Met and is well connected to the museum scene. So she'll offer lots of field trips, which are actually kind of fun, and an easy way to get face time with her. She's pretty passionate about lots of the art, and is well organized. She offered a review section for the final, alternate times for field trips, etc. 
The downside, IMO, is that she often seems to want a single right answer from the class, and when she asks questions she doesn't really embrace alternate or conflicting opinions. 
The midterm had some tricky identification questions, and involved a bit more memorization, and a little bit of writing. The final had easy IDs for unknown works by artists (but come on, at the end of the semester if you can't tell pollock vs rembrandt vs picsasso you deserve a poor grade), plus a bunch of written responses/essays. 
Overall she's a totally fine art hum professor and offers a very acceptable and normal section. You can easily do well if you show up to class, pay attention, and actually visit the museums to write your papers.

I'm much more lukewarm on Servedio than most folks here. I'm an ML type undergrad, not an algos type, so without taking analysis of algorithms or similar I was maybe underprepared for this class. A bit of probability is pretty key for the PAC model in the middle half of the class. 
The material was kind of interesting, but it's very much intellectual exercises with very little real world implications (which isn't exactly a hidden fact). The book for most of the semester (Kearns and Vazirani) is ok, at least it's nice and concise. 
In lectures Servedio was generally clear, but I found that his answers to questions were only so-so. I think part of it is that the class was huge this semester, and it seemed like he wasn't scaling well from 30 students to 100, but maybe that will improve.
The problem sets kicked my ass, I rarely got more than a few points above the average, which was typically 20-30 out of 50 points. They require a huge amount of thought, and almost all required some novel proof technique. Some questions were from research papers from only 5 or 10 years ago, many were papers Servedio wrote 10-20 years ago.  In retrospect I think those who did well were focusing much more on these problem sets earlier, and spending a lot of time in office hours.

I am registered to take this class this semester, however, after seeing the workload I plan on dropping it. The previous reviews made this class look appealing because though it has a moderate to heavy reading load, the only work (based on previous Culpa reviews) was supposed to be three short essays and a take home midterm and final. This is wrong. There is also a 20-30 page research paper due. Gertzog also made it very clear that while the midterm and final are take home, they are very difficult. Gertzog also takes random attendance in the beginning and end of class. This class is not good for anyone that has a heavy schedule or a heavy reading/writing load.

I was looking for a course that could either fulfill the History or Cultures in Comparison requirements of Barnard's 9 Ways. Admittedly, the title of this class is what first intrigued me, and I'm no history major type person (far from it- I'm a physics major). Also that review where it states that they took this class for two reasons, the latter being to learn cool things about pirates (which you do). 
I stayed in this course purely because of Professor Wennerlind. He is an amazing lecturer. I will say that it is difficult to write everything he says, so I recorded all of his lectures for this course after the first class. This helps a lot when you are reviewing for the midterms and finals, because he sometimes answers the essay prompts verbatim during his lecture, and points to authors that answer the question as well. Very useful for when you vaguely remember an essay topic and wrote less than perfect notes on a certain day (please date all your notes if you are recording his class, it makes finding information so much easier) and suddenly you have a professor given summary of the topics you should hit from a lecture a month ago you don't remember too well.
He is very engaging, and knows little details about this course that is frankly stunning. He gives a lot of reading per week, but he very rarely asks about it in class. He will stop to ask people about ideas and topics during the class, to sort of bring student-input, but he is fast to make sure that a student doesn't go on an unrelated sort of tangent. 
It's better to speak up only if you're sure you know what you're talking about. Which is intimidating sometimes, but only because you want to prove to him that you've gleaned some critical insight, if only to see him nod approvingly and bounce off of your work as a conversational jumping point. 
This class is also remarkably low-key. I am not sure if all Barnard history courses are like that, or if it is just this one, but I enjoyed the relax nature of the actual class; where I can sit back and listen to a very-precise-with-his language professor speak about a subject he is obviously very knowledgable of and appreciates. 

Workload:
Around 100 pages or so of reading a week, but not checked very often if you read. Certain texts he will focus on for in class discussions like Equiano or Captain Singleton, but he will tell you in advance to make sure to read a certain text, so you better do so. Three movie/reading responses that I believe factor into your participation grade, since very few people would rise to the occasion to speak during class. You watch 3 different movies (1 on merchants, pirates and slaves individually) and write a reflection and connect to your reading. Don't be afraid to discuss more esoteric subjects on these and have fun. if it's interesting to you, it will be interesting for him as well. Not going to I wrote an essay on a text from 1882 I found 1882 while looking for ""cheese pirates"" (if you watch the pirate movie Treasure Island with Eddie Izard and Elijah Wood you'll understand why I pursued this topic; for the record I got a check plus plus on that response, despite him telling us that the ""grades"" were check minus, check, and check plus. Think outside the box). 
There is one midterm and one final, and he gives the essays you will write for this a week in advance (or more). He gives you like five essays, says he will put three on the exam, and you write two (something like that). You write a total of 5 essays on the midterm and another 5 on the final, with more essay prompts on the final. You will feel crunched for time on the midterm, but don't worry. If you jot down an essay outline for what you don't finish you get credit. 
There is also an essay due about a two weeks before the final. Think about your essay early and often. Please email him about sources because only good things happen when you can jump off of the work he sends you to. He is so helpful with this, and asks his coworkers. Pick an interesting topic that wasn't covered in class, or something you want to know more about.
This class is doable, trust me. I'm not a history person and I got a solid A, with A- on both the midterm and final and an A on the essay, and great participation. 
You can do this class! Super interesting topic, work load not bad compared to what other classes are like, and the Professor is engaging.

Maja is a really nice person, but she isn't the greatest teacher. She isn't the loudest person, so she has to compete with the NYC sounds outside of Dodge. Her explanations in class aren't extremely clear, but not horrible to follow along with. She doesn't allow much discussion in class at all, and at least in my class the few kids that talked kind of engaged in a fancy pancy pissing contest. The blog posts, ten of which you have to post to the class blog, are kind of stupid, just busywork in my opinion. And the papers weren't that great. One was a cross-Core paper, which was not my favorite. We had to write it about super medieval stuff, and lot of my favorite stuff in the Core is of more recent history. The concert and opera papers also involved a lot of BS on my part. I wish she'd just ask us to write about our experiences at the events. The only period of music where I felt she wasn't on top of her game was jazz, which I personally enjoy. We did get three or four live performances during class from our classmates, a choir, and a jazz ensemble, which was really nice. One day she brought in her violin and played, which was awesome! I wish she did that more often. Where you'll actually learn something in this class is in the textbook, which actually is pretty nice to read. You can find it for free online as a PDF and rent the CD's from the bookstore (saves $$$). Overall, I wouldn't necessarily recommend her, but you have her by chance, just read the book and listen to the music, and you'll be fine.

Lindemann was a fantastic, funny teacher and an exceptionally fair grader.  This is definitely a great course to take for credit towards the science requirement if (like me) you're a humanities major.   
Attend class, because she takes attendance with iClickers, but also because I found that the way she presents the material helped me to recall it for the exams.  The exams themselves are challenging but not impossible.  She tells you exactly how to study for it: read the textbook, know all the vocabulary terms she gives you, but really only focus on the details of what is talked about in class.  Personally, I tried to spend about 2-4 hours reading and taking notes on each chapter, but I also often just took notes on the vocabulary when I was pressed for time, and I didn't get below an A on any exam.  The papers were more harshly graded (by the TAs) but they also count for much, much less than the exams do (I got a 17/20 on two and still ended up with an A in the class).  Lindemann also gives you extra credit opportunities each week.  Not a ""never go to class and still get an A"" course, but totally manageable, and Lindemann is a great professor.

Dr. Lloyd is a really, really kind person.  I would say that if you have to take FroSci, he really tried to make it as painless as possible.  He was a delightful teacher and generous grader who was genuinely interested in teaching the course well and frequently asked our class for feedback on how he was doing.    
None of this is to imply that I enjoyed the class--I think there were some people in my course who took it way too seriously, but personally I felt all the usual complaints with the course load (the material was rushed, explained only at the surface level, the seminar dragged on at nearly 2 hours).  I would say that, shockingly, there are a few units from FroSci that I really do remember and feel that I can say I got something out of.  I would attribute this to Dr. Lloyd's patience and kindness, and also the fact that I attended office hours at least once a month to make sure that I got solid marks on the homework.  Some other sections had weekly writing or monthly assignments, but the only real project we did was to write a scientific abstract and present a poster project at the end of the course.  Not completely time consuming and terrible!  Dr. Lloyd also offers a ton of extra credit opportunities.  I am not a math/science person at all and I'm ashamed to say that FroSci was not as easy-breezy for me as it was for some of my classmates, but I finished up with an A nonetheless.  Definitely stay in his section if that's where you were assigned.

Justin treats this class more like Philosophy 101 than like a course in ""Contemporary Civilization."" We usually extracted arguments from texts, and then evaluated them with no regard to historical context. A lot of times, Justin would take an argument and frame it in the form of a contemporary scenario. If you're not very into history or contextualization, and generally enjoy analytical philosophy discussions, this may be great for you. This also means it isn't very important to read - it's super easy to contribute without having read, and as long as you keep your ears open during class you should be fine on the exams.
The class also focused a lot on epistemology and consciousness, and less on ethics and morality. We would often spend entire class periods discussing whether it's really that bad to live in the Matrix or not and stuff like that. I didn't particularly enjoy that, but a lot of kids in the class really loved those discussions.
The papers are also different from those assigned to most other CC sections. We were asked to evaluate very specific arguments and critique them on their logical structure. Grading seemed harsh to me, but it did get easier once I figured out what exactly he wants us to do. Again, the papers didn't feel like CC papers, but they are a great way to improve your writing skills.
Also, I must add, he's a very nice and helpful guy. He's always willing to chat in office hours and help you out with papers and the class in general. He's also quite light-hearted in class. He's also very articulate and great at explaining ideas and concepts. However, he doesn't always assign readings on time, which can be a little frustrating at times. 
All in all, it's not too bad, but make sure you're comfortable with a class that focuses on the more analytical parts of philosophy.

I took Gorsky first semester and overall he is a good teacher. He does not go too in depth into calculus (he stops around using integration to find volume of simple figures) and for the concepts he does cover, he focuses on you knowing the concepts and not doing extremely difficult problems. His accent is a little difficult to understand initially but you will soon get the hang of it. If you have taken Calc AB or BC in high school, this class should be a breeze, but I can imagine people who have no experience in Calculus having a little trouble with some of the concepts, but because he does not go too in depth any difficulties you have can be solved by using google or simply asking him a question. As for grading, he is more than fair. Each exam has extra credit so you can score above a 100, and if you hand in the online homework early you also get 5 extra points on it. The class is an easy A if you keep up and go to class and make sure you understand all the concepts.

Professor Slaughter is one of the best professors I've had at Columbia. While this class was taught as a lecture, Slaughter always encourages his students to ask questions, to challenge his interpretation and to participate in dialogue. He knows that some of the material he covers is difficult to grasp, and always makes sure students are following before he moves on to the next topic. 
If you are taking notes by hand, you'll come out of each class with cramps in your fingers from writing so much: everything he has to say is relevant and fascinating. The readings he assigns are equally great. Each class is centered around 1 or 2 legal texts along with a literary or creative work (novel, graphic novel, film, comic strip etc etc), with occasionally some responses to submit on line (approx every 2 weeks). There is definitely a lot of reading, but Slaughter knows you might not be able to get to all the secondary texts.

One of the worst professors I have had at Columbia. Her discussions were always disorganized. She strayed so far from the text which made it difficult to follow her logic. When students attempted to challenge or questions one of her views, she would never seem to be receptive to these comments. 
The biggest problem with her class was her harsh grading. When you go in for feedback, she destroys your essay without acknowledging anything that you are saying. If you essay disagrees with her views on the text, don't expect to get a good grade. Her comments on the essay were not helpful. She likes to use a lot fancy phrases like the reviewer below described, but these comments never help you improve as a writer.

He never gave us our curved midterm grades and gave us no review material. The other TA's apparently expanded upon Saliba's lectures and gave study guides. But not Kenan. Kenan sent us two sentences with the format of the exam the night before. In class he mumbled at the board for half the semester until he realized that if he just had us discuss in groups, he wouldn't have to do any work.

Warren is simply not invested in the class he showed a movie in class at least 4 times and canceled class three times. He comes off as very nice and likable.

I know of at least half a dozen people who have emailed him and the TAs none of them have responded at all. The vagueness from the political science department implies that they to have been unable to contact him.

I took Calculus I with Dave and it was amazing. I was extremely surprised when I went on Culpa and did not see any reviews written about him online.
He brings a friendly atmosphere to the class and is 100% approachable in class as well as during his office hours. Dave really knows the material and occasionally adds interesting math problems and topics that diverge from the syllabus required concepts, but helps you think of math in a completely different way. They also show he has a genuine interest in what he teaches. Some of the teachers I have seen so far struggle to engage with the class or have a strangely tense atmosphere warding off all potential Calculus I students or students who just have an interest in math (not that only students who love math should take this class anyone and everyone should). He would often make random jokes here and there that always made the class laugh. 
The class goes over what you would expect Calculus I to be about: limits, differentials, integrals, the works. As long as you attend class, do the homework, and study you'll do great. We also did not need to use Webassign, which was amazing for any of you guys that do not like the idea of submitting complex answers online and having to buy the expensive code for the website.  
He allowed the class to use a one page sheet of paper with any notes or formulas for the final exam. WHO DOES THAT?? IT WAS DOUBLE-SIDED TOO!!!
I highly recommend this class for anyone who needs to take Calculus I or just wants to take a class taught by him in general. Definitely a gold nugget or at least a silver nugget.

- Has attitude 
- Unclear lectures
- Sets very little expectations of what is expected in written assignments, so it's pretty much a stab in the dark 
- After said assignment is handed in- will bring up some obscure argument from the text and complain no one in the class got it. 
- One of those professors who went to a crappy school and in order to make up for his lack of personal acumen takes pleasure in showing up Columbia Students and giving them low grades.

In the fall 2014, Tina didn’t even teach art humanities according to the course directory.

Exhibit C: Look at the number of disagrees with all the positive reviews of Tina.
Exhibit D: Look at the writing style of the positive reviews. Do they seem similar/use similar adjectives/sentence structure?

This is one of my favorite classes at Columbia. This is one of the very few classes where both theory and application of computer science comes together. And the manner in which Professor Edwards teaches this class is incredible. Professor Edwards is very organized and well prepared for lectures. His slides are very comprehensive and lectures are very clear. On the side note, he also brings in ""Stephen Colbert"" style humors in class which can be quite entertaining at times.
The project is the centerpiece of this class. It allows you to build a programming language on your own from scratch. This can be a great experience because you are dissecting every component of the building blocks of a modern programming language. 
Much has been written about OCaml which is the language used in the project. But half way through the semester, everyone realizes that due to its very important features like pattern matching and strict type referencing, OCaml is simply the best language for building a programming language in a semester long period. There is also a huge inventory of past projects done in OCaml in the class website that can be very useful reference. Some people who had taken this class with Professors other than Edwards often ran into challenges due to lack of resources and reference materials. 
I highly recommend taking this course with Professor Edwards. Make sure to find  good teammates and make use of past projects as a guide. You will end up with a great project and your own programming language. The things that are learned in this class such as project management, teamwork, testing, leadership have applications for rest of the CS career.

In short, Rocco is the best professor I had in Columbia so far.  He is kind, clear, and intelligent. He made a difficult subject accessible and interesting.
That said, if you hate proofs and theory, maybe this class is not for you, but this is not his fault. He already tried his best to focus on the concept rather than the details.
I don’t think that the class has no applications. It’s basically an algorithm class, but on algorithms that can learn. If you think algorithms have no real world application, then I am not sure what to say.  It’s cool to see that a seemingly simple-minded algorithm can learn complex concepts well, on par with humans (maybe it is how human brains work).
The homework takes a long time, so start early so that you have enough time to get help. He won’t tell you the solution directly, but at least can tell you if you are on the right track. A lot of times, people are just completely off the track because they have misconceptions. For me, I think part of the homework difficulty comes from my unfamiliarity with the area, so the 3rd and 4th homeworks turned out more difficult for me, but by the end of the last (5th) homework, I had already seen enough proof strategies that they became a bit like old tricks  (I’m not saying they are easy, but just more familiar to me).
As a previous post said, the final project turned out to be an educational experience for me. But I guess it depends on what paper you choose. I chose something closely related to what we learned and also not too ambitious, and it turned out to be a good choice.  I am glad that I was able to understand at least some parts of an original research paper in the field, which depends your understanding of class material but also adds onto that.
About latex, I have mixed feelings. It’s really a pain to type in latex. I feel I spent close to half of my homework time on typing up in latex. But I understand that it makes things easier for TAs, who already have a lot of work. Also, some other classes (e.g ML) may require latex.
In summary, I learned a lot without too much stress. (the homeworks can be stressful/frustrating , but overall, the amount learned/stress ratio is much higher than an average CS class at Columbia).

Ronna was by far my favorite professor first semester. She's knowledgable, sweet, and just an overall good person and professor. She made everyone in the class feel comfortable and was able to facilitate group discussions really well. Her office hours are also really helpful, so be sure to go to them. She tries to make herself available as much as she can.
She grades fairly, and is very conscious about handing drafts back so that we have enough time for the final draft. My advice would be to treat every draft like the final draft, so that you don't have to cram writing a whole new essay in a week. 
The readings she chose were really interesting too, more so than the other sections from what I could gather. They changed my views on a lot of different gender related topics.

Xiao laoshi is one of the greatest things to ever happen to my education. I can't say enough about her and I normally would never write a review for a professor, but she deserves more than just one review. I learned more Chinese under this woman in a semester than I did throughout the past four years of taking the language. She's efficient, and keeps you disciplined and accountable for your own progress. She's also sassy, funny, and genuinely cares about her students. The material never seemed cumbersome, and the amount of work she gave was definitely challenging, but in no way overwhelming (and I credit the latter to the fact that she made she we understood every single character and grammar structure). I cannot sing enough praises about her. 
Workload:
The class isn't a walk in the park, don't get me wrong. You'll have quizzes every single day, a test every other week or so, and little projects to do in between. There's about two midterms, and a final. But to be honest, Xiao loashi times the course material to the assessments (which are department wide) so well that I never felt out of my depth. I barely even studied because she had drilled the vocabulary and grammar structures into me so well that they were like second nature.

So I took this class as a way to fulfill my global core requirement. At first, on the first day, I was so confused as the class did not seem to have a particular structure, and everyone started so late so people were coming and going but I decided to stick with it.
Best decision I have ever made. Professor Ochoa is an incredible, smart and genuinely nice woman who just really wants you to understand and enjoy the music you discover in class. She enjoys and gets very excited when you share your opinion so do participate. All in all, do take this class as Professor Ochoa is probably the best teacher you will ever have!!!!

This content of this class was interesting to learn and so was the presentation of the material by Prof. Russell.  This isn't a strict accounting class.  If you're looking for that, you're in the wrong class.  I'll spend less time reviewing the content and more time reviewing the professor.
Prof. Russell seems to be a very nice person and certainly has a great amount of knowledge on the subject.  For all the enthusiasm and energy the professor has for his subject, and for all the work that the student is expected to produce, the amount of feedback the student receives is almost none.  I repeat, not one of the three major projects handed in merited any feedback from the professor.  This issue was the elephant in the room throughout the semester.  You won't know how you are doing (grade-wise) in this class other than the problem sets returned by the TA. Of the three major projects handed in during the semester, not one hint of feedback was given to any of the students in this class.
If receiving feedback from your hard work is important to you, do not take this class.  However, if you'd like to be exposed to corporate accounting practices that involve environment, social, and government (ESG) metrics while at the same time gain some understanding why this might be important, then this class is enlightening.

I took Calc I with Sachin three years ago. Since then, I've taken Calc II, Calc III (also with Sachin), and Linear Algebra. Looking back and comparing my experience with Sachin with my experience with other professors, Sachin is absolutely gold. He is incredibly clear, precise, and actually gets to know his students by name towards the end of the semester. I've had at least one other good math professor here at Columbia (shout out to Davesh Maulik!), but Sachin still holds a dear, dear place in my heart. A+
Right now he seems to be teaching more advanced courses in Math, which I'm excited for him about, but many other people are missing out on taking the initial math classes with this gem of a professor!

Pros:
Professor Gundogdu is a brilliant professor, and extremely nice.
I heard from many of my peers that she was very helpful in office hours.
No homework.
Readings aren't necessary, you could leave it for last minute and understand the parts you have to read and smart-read them. usually, you will have to focus on a chapter or two. 
No midterm, no final. 3 papers. 
She gives out a detailed outline for all papers that really help. 
Cons:
Mandatory attendance, you pass around an attendance sheet for each lecture. 
No computers allowed! (WHAT THE.... was my first comment but each to his own I guess...)
Mandatory disc sessions which go by quite fast since it's usually the TA talking and peers sharing thoughts. 
Since there are a lot of GS Students, many well thought claims come to light which help for the essays.
Each time a paper topic was announced, 70% of the class was confused. Like literally, the next lecture would go by with people reformulating ""WHAT SHOULD I WRITE?"" around a million times.. 
Personally, I enjoyed the class very much. She organized the class so that she begun with Plato's democracy discussion up until John Locke, etc. So, it was like a timeline of political theory. She is obviously very intelligent and extremely kind, yet not the most entertaining teacher, I must say. Grades really depend on the TA, hope that you get an easy TA for the final one!

Eleni is such a nice prof and great lecturer. She teaches very clearly and has very well written slides. She will often use the blackboard to go over a proof or concept more carefully. There were also two guest lectures from researchers at Google and Facebook on Ad bidding and MapReduce, which were nice treats and quite interesting. This material is not tested.
The only thing is that this class was the ""Data Science"" version of the normal Analysis of Algorithms class. This meant there were a lot of IDSE students, who didn't have much CS background. This really, really slowed down the pace of the class, with all the questions that were asked. If you come from a CS background, you would be better off taking the normal Algos class.
Homework was a combination of theory and programming, however, which is nice. Any language is ok, although Python is preferred, especially for the linear programming. TAs took a long time to grade the homeworks and offered little feedback.
Exams were comprehensive, and essentially tested understanding of the main results that were showed as well as algorithm design/analysis. Averages were very low, but I think that's normal for any algos class. Final is easier as long as you understand NP-completeness and reductions.

Katja is a very straightforward Lit Hum professor. She expects you to have done the reading, but will often ask about simple plot points to catch people up (which is a great way to get class participation points). She's good at facilitating conversation and leading people to the conclusion she wants the class to make--her lesson plans are all quite structured. There's food every class during break, provided by student sign-ups, which is nice. She's a reasonable grader, and expects straightforward essay structure and content. She's never woken anyone up during class (definitely guilty of sleeping through a few), though she does get frustrated if you're habitually late or absent, or use your phone during class. She doesn't hold regular office hours, but is happy to talk after class or by appointment.

Alessandra is a terrific professor. She's from Italy and has a great accent. All of her instructions (including the entire textbook) are in Italian, which is a little confusing but does help teach the language. She's outrageously sweet and gets to know her students almost immediately. I would absolutely recommend Alessandra, especially for people just starting out in Italian. She'll regularly have students listen to music during class, or learn about Italian art or food. It's one of the classes where you get out what you put in, because she's a very lax grader. My only complaint is that she struggles to articulate grammar rules in an accessible way because her Italian is so much better than her English, though she manages to get the point across.

This class was incredibly frustrating. The first four weeks covered material that I could have learned about by watching a semi-intellectual sitcom, whereas the rest of the semester moved at high speed. He very quickly covers or even completely skips over the very complicated formulas that deserved two weeks to discuss. The lectures were mumbled and filled with ranting, and whenever he worked out a problem on the chalkboard, he wrote small and scribbled, without properly explaining anything about it. I ended up teaching myself all of the materials, as he was never available and the TA's were completely unhelpful. You actually saw students in the class pulling out wikipedia in class to teach themselves the material while tuning the professor out. He once re-scheduled a make-up test without telling me that he changed the date, causing me to wait in the STAT office for an hour for no reason. He briefly apologized. The textbook is well done, easy to understand if you are willing to spend several hours a week teaching yourself.
The project took hours of data collection and analysis. He poorly explained the first part, so it was entirely possible to get to the second section of the project without having the information needed to fill it out. The grading was clearly done by a brief skimming of the material, and they docked me 10 points that I later got back for failing to notice information that I put in bold all-caps at the beginning of the second page- making it painfully obvious they picked a grade without looking at the assignment.

I agree wholeheartedly with the last review (June 10, 2011). The main issue I took with the class was that I never really quite understood why we were reading what we did, which was a big issue because there was a mountain of readings every week, most of them extremely boring and some just completely inane. Prof. Mazower never once tried to explain either the historical or historiographical significance of any of what we read; at times, he would even admit that what we were studying wasn't historically significant at all. E.g. there was one class on the subject of ""making money/the modern economy"", and the main reading for that week had to do with Russian fur trappers in Alaska. It wasn't a terrible book and made a case for its historiographical intervention, but in the grand scheme of things--when considering the history of the ""modern economy""--the case of fur trappers in Alaska is hardly significant at all! That was kind of emblematic, for me, of the nature of the class as a whole. It was a huge letdown, given the exciting course title/description. In class, he did very little to facilitate discussion, which ended up more or less monopolized by two or three students. Finally, I felt that it was unfair to have literally one assessment--the 25-30 page final paper--upon which your entire grade is based. As others have mentioned, he's a hard grader, which is fine; however, what's not fine is that there's zero feedback all semester as to what he looks for in essays, or even if he thinks you're doing well. I think that if a professor is going to evaluate essays rigorously, he/she should make it clear what those rigorous standards are.
Overall a frustrating experience. I definitely regret not switching out when I had the chance.

Honestly, this was probably the most useful, hands-on class I've taken in my four years as an Art History major at Columbia. Not only is Lynn a fantastic professor (engaging, stimulating, thoughtful, and extremely knowledgeable), but the course itself was a critical (and fun!) exploration of questions we don't examine often enough in other Art History classes at Columbia. The authenticity of artworks is something we all too often take for granted in the field, and this class forced me to adjust my eye, so to speak; to look at art afresh by revaluating the primary material itself. We discussed how authenticity is measured and determined, from connoisseurship to provenance research to forensic examinations (a discipline less practical than one might imagine!). 
Lynn always used specific – and fascinating – case studies to illustrate these complexities and conundrums. Lots of exciting stuff came up while unpicking these examples, of course – discussion of real-world fakes and copies and how to spot them, even with an untrained eye. Very often the case studies came from Lynn’s own career, which not only meant we were getting all the information first-hand and from the most knowledgeable source possible (and often got to see her as-yet unpublished work too, which was fascinating) but also that we got a glimpse into the field of authentication. (It sounds like an academic treasure hunt: about equal parts sitting in archives sorting through irrelevant and/or tedious material, and discovering wonderful, mind-boggling things that have a real-world impact.)
The final project of the class was a 30-40pg research paper (tailored to your specific interests) delving into the provenance of an art object of your choice. I chose to work at the Frick Collection, and a whole world was opened up for me because of it. I learnt the ins and outs of archival work and many valuable skills I will carry with me for use in my professional life. And it was fun! Stumbling across the gems scattered here and there made the hours spent in the Met’s Watson Library and the Frick’s Art Reference Library feel totally worth it. There's also the added bonus of feeling like your paper actually MEANS something: my provenance research discovered things about Frick artworks that the museum itself was not aware of, and in this regard I got to feel like I contributed in a tangible way to a field I'm passionate about (possibly for the first time in my life).
We also took some amazing field trips throughout the semester. My favourites were those at the Frick (where we were given a personal tour by some of the curators and got to explore the Collection's private vault) and Bonhams Auction House (where the head authenticator told us about the difficulties and practicalities of authenticating art when massive amounts of money are involved). But overall I think I enjoyed class-time even more: it was hours of listening to a leading authority speak passionately about a really interesting field most people know very little about.
TL;DR: The class has made me critical, in the healthiest possible way, about things I had taken for granted in the field of Art History. I genuinely believe I now look at artworks with a more critical eye than before, and Lynn is worth having as a teacher if for that skill alone. But also she’s great and the paper is great and you should take the class!

Depends on how much effort you put in. There were weekly readings that honestly were pretty optional -- we didn't discuss them in class. Most of your time will be spent researching your paper, but, again, the amount of time you put in is really up to you. I did spend two full workdays each week in the Frick researching my paper (+ more time trawling the internet for clues at home), but you could definitely break that into shorter, more manageable intervals of time. As for actually writing the paper -- well, once you've done all that research, the paper pretty much writes itself.

The only thing was even though she's really nice, she's also really direct which I found off-putting at first (she WILL put you on the spot or will just say ""that's wrong"" in front of everyone. Oh, and she hates Pride and Prejudice and let us know it). However, this directness also means she'll give you really practical rules for how to get an A or will give you a list of ""pet peeves"" never to commit in papers.

In short, this is a bad class.
For more specific information about the class, you can look at the directory, the course site, request a syllabus, and so forth. The class itself was a bore, and everyone in the class knew it. It was worthwhile in the sense that it covered material that is tangentially relevant to leadership however not necessarily applicable to organizations. Think of it as a cursory psych class, if you will. 
Unfortunately, there are too many downsides to this course. If you're looking for a good intro course to MBA material, I hope to high hell this isn't it. Wallen is passive aggressive, in that he appears to always understand contingencies and make allowances (as will inevitable come up for many people, since the class is run differently from a typical undergrad structure; for example, there may be zero tolerance for any absence. Not my experience, but a warning.), but always will leave you feeling like he's jotting it down with his other hand. Maybe this is typical MBA, maybe this is Wallen. 
The course evaluation revolves around group papers, some quantum of participation, a final paper you're allegedly working towards all semester long, and the final. As far as group papers, it's really the luck of the draw as far as collective ability is concerned. Worse, it's quite the luck of the draw what your final grade might be. Wallen clearly has trouble recruiting TAs to his silly class, and the TAs scandalously neglected replying to emails, requests for office hours, and so forth. So much so, in fact, that Wallen personally involved himself in turning the TA ship around mid-semester (to little effect). 
As far as participation, the class content is so superficial that you would get more from the material by reading through all the relevant Harvard Business Review articles online; to that end, participation usually involved the 3-6 people who did not shy away from discussing ""correspondence bias"" for 5 minutes while the rest of the class waited for Wallen's concurring. 
As far as the final paper, oh boy, you're in for a ride. He gives you extremely specific instructions, a formula most certainly, for how to synthesize it. On the face of it, it sounds interesting and worthwhile. The manner in which he grades the papers is, ironically, degrading. He leaves a disclaimer on his feedback that the grade and his response is his 'professional' judgement of your ability to follow the instructions for writing the paper. Please note, this paper is supposed to be your ""Personal Development Plan [for life and other endeavors]."" Essentially, what this means is that there is absolutely no latitude for expressing yourself. Is that enough to describe the quandary? It seems quite futile to develop a personal development plan, only to have it austerely evaluated by an arbitrary rubric. So it became kind of like a 9th grade essay from high school. Bottom line is, if you have the tolerance to be blatantly fake (in a ""oh so honest"" manner, obviously), go for it; otherwise, your personal development plan may be subject to harsh criticism. This leads to the greater issue with the class, that due to its superficiality, you have to make a pained effort to bother with it, rather than delve into it. 
Finally, the way that he ensures a complete grade distribution for the class (the resulting satisfaction of which he didn't fail to mention in the followup email to the final) is to ask arbitrary questions about readings from any corner of the syllabus. i think this is what one might call ""professorial guerilla tactics,"" and it is painful and very difficult to contend with. It also is a very poor approach to evaluating the material one might've learned over the course of the entire semester. Questions that appeared were even as unapologetic as, ""Author X discussed the concept of Y. Specifically in his discussion of Z, what were the 3 points?"" If you're the kind of student who memorizes all the details for a psych exam, this course is for you. If you're actually interested in leadership... well, you'd probably not be spending your time trying to memorize different lists from the literature. 
Overall, sure, this is just another 'easy' course offered by the B school to undergrads. people will continue to fight for a spot. But ask yourself, is this really worth your while?

I took this class my freshman year as a potential chemistry major. Thanks to her, I'm studying Latin American History.
Professor Pizzigoni loves what she studies (it's the lives of indigenous peoples in the colonial era in case you were curious) and loves to teach it even more. I wouldn't skip lectures as she doesn't put notes online, but I can't imagine why you would want to in the first place. Her lectures are fascinating, and with her delightful Italian accent she draws you into the material you can't help but gain an interest in. She very much encourages class participation (not an easy feat when lectures have 150+ students), but she fosters such a warm and open atmosphere that it's almost natural to do so. 
Also of note: she's one of the most approachable professors on campus. She takes an active interest in getting to know her students, and is always ready to help out in any way that she can. She has a playful personality and childlike sense of wonder that is exceedingly rare, but make no mistake she is one of the most intelligent people you will ever meet.

Textbook readings are assigned, but it's honestly not necessary if you attend class frequently.

Dr. Merchant, despite her best efforts to the contrary, is one of the most bewilderingly inept and boring teachers (if she can even be called that) to grace this university. She is totally oblivious to the potential for banality of the Frontiers of Science curriculum, and does her best to drag students down mentally and quash any interest they might begin to develop. In addition to the weekly FroSci homework assignment, she requires an additional piece of homework every week, which is normally a pointless writeup on the reading for that week. In addition, she holds regular quizzes and her section activities are truly truly awful. She doesn't display any motivation to make the course interesting, and often appears to simply be going through the motions. 
Don't make the mistake of not trying to switch out of her section - a semester with her is a truly horrendous 'educational' (if it can be called that...) experience.

Gulati is a fantastic professor.  His lectures were interesting and engaging enough to get me to class each morning at 8:40 am even during the dullest material.  His class is intense, however.  There are several pop iClicker quizzes, two difficult exams, and four problem sets throughout the course.  He seemingly goes into the material at a much greater depth than the other professors teaching Principles.

Great lecturer for CC. He definitely does the background research on the the different authors and texts. He even took a class just on Kant to make sure that he understood the text inside and out. He spends about half of class lecturing with slides and often includes real-life examples or multimedia, such as contemporary movies or news segments. For the readings, he sends out discussion questions beforehand to guide your reading and the discussion in class. The discussion is pretty lively, but that obviously depends on the other people, but he does a good job of keeping the discussion lively.

I think Mowshowitz is a very solid teacher--she's good at getting the information across, but she's not outstanding. She really cares about her students though and genuinely wants everyone to do well. My advice for people in this class is not to stress. If you over think tests then you just psych yourself out and do badly. Her tests are hard, but she doesn't usually want you to come up with convoluted answers or anything like that. My first semester I stressed so much about this class and didn't do very well, but the second semester I decided to loosen up and not study as much and I did way way better. I think for her class you really just have to accept that you are good at taking her tests or you're not. Some people are really good at them and some people just aren't.
My ""review"" of this class is to tell all people not to worry too much! It's really not worth the stress and you will do fine! Just do the problem sets!!

The problem sets were challenging, but the lecture notes and Office Hours made them more than doable, and she allows for collaboration with other students.

If you're ready to take Lit Hum all over again, take Colloquium with Professor Chung. The class is very discussion based, and because you only meet once a week (and only spend one week on each text), you get to dive into the text very quickly. Professor Chung has a few points that she tried to get to for each work, but the discussion is often led by students in the class. Each week began with Professor Chung asking students what they thought of the texts, and the class discussion often continued from these thoughts on one tangent or another for the majority of the course. 
The amount of reading really varied, with some weeks requiring only 20-40 pages of dense philosophy and others entire novels that you can skim fairly quickly. The amount of work was definitely manageable. For the first eight weeks of the semester Professor Chung required a one page reading response due at the beginning of class, but by the midpoint in the semester she decided that they were ""optional."" The two papers were also fairly straight-forward. Meet with her a week or two in advance and she'll give you some great guidance in choosing your topics and formulating your arguments, but you can literally wrote on anything you want. 
The best part of the course by far were Professor Chung's insights. She really knows her stuff, and while she's not a Titan in the field like De Bary or Schirokauer, she actually *teaches*, and everyone in my section seemed to really enjoy the times when she actually spend 20-30 mins giving background or her interpretation. 
Can't speak to everyone's grades, but I participated a fair amount, went to OHs a few times, wrote two fairly good papers and got an A. I'm guessing most people who expected to get an A/A- were successful. A very enjoyable course overall.

Professor Kallas is one of the most unique and interesting film professors in the department. Her lectures resist simplification and do not always follow a predictable structure however this complexity provides a refreshing contrast to the rest of the department. Students who prefer a clear and direct teaching style may not get the most out of this course. 
The course examines traditional cinematic structure in practice and history but more interestingly examines structures outside of this model. She has written extensively on nontraditional screenwriting structures in multiprotagonist film and lectures extensively on emotional structure theory (an incredibly interesting and complex screenwriting theory). The screenings, assigned readings and analysis are very engaging and current. The course may be an interesting and beneficial option for non majors and anyone interested in screenwriting.

Dr. Carr is one of the best professors I've had at Columbia. Yes, I had her for Frontiers of Science, but let me tell you: she made this class something I actually looked forward to going to. She is one of the sweetest, kindest, and most caring individuals I've met in academia. She really cares about her students and gives her all to ensure that her students are engaged, learning, and content. FoS was probably one of the worst courses ever, but if you had Dr. Carr, you'll know that she is the best. 
She's a teacher that just wants you to be happy as a student, regardless of whether or not you're actually passionate about the subject matter at hand. That being said, she really tries to find ways to incorporate interesting facts, scientific findings, etc. into her seminars so that concepts make sense and the material doesn't feel vanilla and superfluous. If you're in her class, you're lucky. If you're not and you're trying to be now, you're welcome.
Amber Carr is a super approachable person and she is such an interesting and awesome person. Her office hours were always super helpful and I personally went every week, some weeks to actually get help and some weeks to just turn in my homework and talk to her and have nice conversations.

Jeremy Forster was a fantastic preceptor for CC, and I can see him working well for any type of student. If you're like me, and you're just in a philosophy course because it's a core requirement, Jeremy will really sell you on these texts. If you have a genuine interest in the field, Forster knows his stuff, and he can get into very nuanced discussions about the arguments that most of the class will enjoy.
One of the best parts of the class was that Jeremy really limited the amount of reading required. Instead of trying to digest a book per week, Jeremy selects chapters and excerpts that you will actually discuss in class, and they were often only 40 or so pages per week (although occasionally you had to read the whole book). The class was usually structured as 1/3rd Jeremy lecturing on the work, 1/3rd class discussion on the work, and 1/3rd class discussion on a concept that was related to the work but allowed everyone who had not actually read the works to particulate. He also gave us a ten-minute break to eat snacks in the middle. 
Each week you had to write a one-page response paper, although I forgot to do one or two and it didn't end up having an impact on my grade. The papers were also very straight-forward, and you could either write a fairly straight-forward paper on one of the prescribed topics or a more creative paper on the topic of your choice. The midterm and final were both fairly easy, with one of them taking place in class and one as a take-home. The excerpts on the exams were incredibly easy to identity, and the essay topics were taken straight from the class discussion.

This class should not be called Photo-I, it should be called Thomas Roma-I. If you want to immerse yourself in a semester of Thomas Roma, take this class. Incidentally, if you're lucky, you might learn some photography as well. Thomas Roma embodies the phrase ""cult of personality."" He is quite the personality: funny, witty, mean, kind of like the extremely self-assured bully. But I do believe that having high standards and expecting people to live upto them is a good thing, and definitely developed me in some way. Having been the recipient of a number of brutal critiques, that often left me questioning my entire personality, I was definitely inspired to really think about why I was putting up the works that I was putting up and what they meant and in this sense the class was better than other workshops I have been in where professors are nice to your work whether they suck or are good. So as opposed to other people who didnt like him, I really was grateful that he was honest with his critique and called out things that sucked for what they were.
Did my abilities as a photographer improve in this class. Yes. However, the price one pays to obtain this in terms of feeding his enormous ego is almost not worth it. In a 2.5 hour lecture he spends about an hour or 45 minutes actually talking about why your photograph is good or why it sucks and spends most of the time relating random (and probably made-up) stories about his life that have nothing to do with photography. In critiquing your photo not only will he insult your photograph if it sucks but he will also make it a point to directly insult your personality and you as an individual, which to me didn't really matter that much but was quite unnecessary wrt to improving me as a photographer and was done more for his pleasure. He is an individual who knows that his popularity and cult-status affords him power and he definitely uses this power to the maximum and gets away with a lot of stuff that no one really could get away with. Thus a lot of this class is in my opinion quite unnecessary. As opposed to the students who hung on every word he said as if he appeared in the clouds and ordered us to write all he said on stone, I was quite unimpressed by most of his stories. The most annoying part of the class was that we each had to ask him a question unrelated to photography, about his personal life, after each critique. So that is like 20 irrelevant stories per class already, not counting the ones he launches into during a critique. I kind of went there to learn about photography, not to fill his ego by laughing at and being audience to his stories about his girlfriends and mother and son and what-not. You have to really have drunk the Thomas Roma kool-aid deeply and fully to willingly sit through his lectures with wide-eyed wonder.
In short my opinion of this class is that there is a lot of bull-shit, a lot of unnecessary insulting but in the depths of all this there is genuine honest critique to be found and genuine honest growth as a photographers to be realized. And that is actually pretty rare to find. So my final verdict is take this class, but take it with a an entire spoonful of salt

Professor Herb is the only man in the world that can raise a chimpanzee, basically teach it how to talk, dress it in awesome clothes and get a movie made about himself and his off the wall adventures with his furry companion... then turn around and bitch about it.

I didn't find the negative comments about Dr Shohamy below substantiated in the slightest. My perspective is that of an engineer and premed taking this class. I took MBB to fulfill the premed psych requirement while learning about the biological aspect of psych (i.e., none of the dodgy handwavy psychology of Science of Psych). I don't understand the people who say she's awful and goes too fast. I would say my experience has been on the whole positive.
Professor Shohamy is quite a good lecturer (again coming from a hard sciences+engineering background). She seems genuinely passionate about the subject and lectures clearly and compellingly, often using interesting videos, graphics, and recent culture (i.e., memes and viral phenomena) to make her points. The material is very interesting, though I don't understand why she doesn't just call the class Intro Cognitive Neuroscience. We learn about the brain and techniques in psychological experimentation to understand how it works, starting from the structure of a neuron. My one complaint is that the amount of material presented is low; the information density of the course is such that one could get 100% of the material attending half the lectures and doing no outside studying or reading.
One think that did take me aback was the sheer number of random questions asked in class. The number of times someone began a question or comment with ""Once my mom..."" or ""I have this aunt who..."", etc. (followed by a completely unrelated anecdote or crackpot theory) was staggering. The class almost becomes the clearinghouse for every random curiosity about psychology and neuroscience that any liberal arts major who otherwise would never interact with a real scientist could have. Mostly being facetious but I suspect a large subpopulation of the class are only there to fulfill the science requirement.

No homework, two easy (curved) exams, plus a final. They're just regurgitating information and she gives you the essays beforehand; I honestly cannot understand why this class is curved. I scored over 90 on both exams with minimal studying. If you've had Mowsh, this class is a breeze.

One of the best courses to be taught at the MAFN Program. Prof. Cheklov is a Princeton Math PhD and is well known in the Columbia Math Department as an extraordinary researcher and a brilliant communicator. 
In the course one studies financial time series analysis , from the statistical physics point of view. A parallel is drawn between theory of turbulence  and how its laws can be adapted to study today's financial time series such as those of S&P 500 Index etc. Various concepts such as Frequency  or Energy spectra of Long and Short term memory processes and their relationship with auto-correlation function is studied in an altogether different context. 
Another big attraction of this course is the study of Levy processes and its properties and advantages over the traditional Weiner process( a subset of Levy processes) in explaining the actual or observed Price returns of the Assets .
There are other fascinating topics, such as dynamics of limit order book etc, for which one has to take this course in order to fully appreciate.
To conclude, a must take course for anybody who is willing to think outside the box and is in love with both Physics and Finance.

I am amazed at how unbelievably awful of a lecturer Professor Kao is. Most of the lectures cover either obscure psych studies that are barely relevant to the material or very detailed anatomical and physiological information about psych topics that she tells us we don't need to know. She occasionally goes over some important definitions, but she basically repeats what's in the book. If she goes into anything with any level of excitement, it's usually a biological process that she tells us we don't actually need to know. 
For our midterm, she's given us very little information (and unlike most science of psych classes, we only have one). We've been told that it will be 50% multiple choice and 50% short answer, but I honestly have no idea how to study because there is no practice exam, no list of topics, and little help from her in class. 
I'm halfway through this course and thankfully she isn't teaching the second half, but even a semester of these lectures was too much - and by too much, I mean too little important, course-relevant information and too much random, useless information.

Professor Collins is, simply put, the best professor I have ever had at Columbia.
But if he's not your style, you will not have a good time in his class.
I had him for both methods and problems and epistemology, and the difference between a 120 person class and an 8 person class was huge.  In Epistemology, Collins could actually get to know each and every one of us, and he was honestly interested.  It's a tough subject to master, but he went clearly and methodically through every subject, making sure everyone got what was going on.
If you are a fan of syllabi and structure and knowing exactly what's on the exam, this is not the professor for you.  Our ""syllabus"" was a list of topics that he wanted to get to at some point.  He writes his exams the morning of the test, and if you ask him what's on it he will honestly tell you that he doesn't know.  If that bothers you, don't take a class with Collins.
If you're a fan of philosophy and really thinking critically, this is the class for you.
This is the kind of class that will keep you up at night, not because you're in butler studying but because you're lying in bed thinking about that days lecture and wondering if we know anything at all.

This class (art hum) was incredibly interesting at times. I really enjoyed working on the essays. The amazingness of the course made up for the fact that Caitlin was the most boring and uninspiring teacher I've ever had. She practically discouraged participation with her blandness. We (the few of us who contributed to class discussion) were able to guide the conversations which was good but I often found myself on the verge of sleep.
Overall great class but terrible professor.
She's a sort of fair grader I would say.

Kasara is definitely not the most clear of lecturers and she goes incredibly quickly through her slides which are often packed with text - I would sometimes just give up trying to copy things down because there was no way I would get it all. She mumbles and often seems a bit disengaged with the people in the room while she lectures, so if you can't handle that than this isn't the course for you.While she clearly knows what she is talking about she isn't great at communicating it. 
That being said, I learned a ton in this course and overall I really enjoyed it. She has dense lectures and she often expects you to know about the situation or event that she is lecturing on, but if you have done the readings you will have a pretty good understanding and should be prepared. The reading is pretty textbook and dense, but it definitely helps you understand the course - you can often skim to find the key points and she will fill in the details in class. I thought that my TA held great discussion sections and was incredibly helpful - he went over anything we didn't understand and made sure to cover all of the tough topics in an engaging way. The TA's also hold review sessions before all of the exams which are really helpful. The exams required quite a bit of studying but if you have good notes and can determine the key concepts you should be fine (she also uploads all of her powerpoints online so you can review from there before exams). 
Workload:
Weekly reading of 2-3 long chapters and  a 20 page case study on a particular nation or an outside article, kind of dense but can easily skim for main points. 
Three exams throughout the semester, no real final. If you review her powerpoints they aren't that bad. Each had 5 IDs and a few short answer Qs and two of the exams had an extra credit short answer as well.

This was an incredibly fun course for a student who didn't know much about theatre. Seeing a show every week was amazing, and it really opened my eyes to amazing theatre off-Broadway. The shows were all very different and while not completely traditional, I didn't think that they were overly avant-garde (but I don't have too much knowledge about what counts as avant-garde theatre). I was very impressed by the line up of the shows we saw - we went to The Public, BAM, Soho Rep, Theatre for a New Audience, and many more. Many times the show we saw would have a front-page rave review in the NYTimes Arts section the next day. For someone who wants to experience the NYC theatre scene it was amazing.You also only have one class a week so it's relatively low stress. One note - a lot of the class time focuses on how the theatre works and how the business works as a whole. I found this really interesting but if you don't care about how they run a theatre or put on a show then McMath's class may not be your favorite. 
Each week you write a response paper (about two pages) for the previous weeks show. My problem with this was that we NEVER got grades on them, just a check and maybe a comment or two about what you could improve. There were also no guidelines for these papers. I literally had no idea what my grade in the class would be until I got it. In addition we had two research papers at midterm/final time that were very easy - each had to be ten pages but there was a checklist of topics to cover that easily got you there if you were willing to look up all of the info. There were readings each week but you could get through the entirety of the semester without really reading at all - we would occasionally discuss them in class for a few minutes but thats it, more often we focused on the general topic of the readings so if you had skimmed a bit to get the gist you were completely fine!

I actually LOVE Professor Cohen. I will admit what the other 2 reviews said about knowing background information on Israel is true and important, but you certainly don't need to be an expert on the region. Professor Cohen caters towards those with a real interest in internal Israeli politics and issues and he is certainly opinionated and has an Israeli attitude. However, he can be quite hilarious. The readings were very interesting, very readable. His class is pretty chill, as are the assignments. It is easy to do well. I learned a lot from him and found class discussions to be very valuable. He doesn't want you to memorize statistics and figures, but rather he wants you to get a larger picture and be knowledgable enough to have discussions about particular issues.

Hector is a great professor who really commits to his teaching. Although occasionally I find it a little difficult to follow his accent, in general, his lectures and coursework materials are really helpful for someone who wants to construct a sound basis for calculus. What I like most about his class is that he has a lot of bonus questions in the homework as well as exams, which can boost your grades up to 50%. Even for a lazy student as myself who never starts doing assignments until the last minute, the outcome of homework and exams were very well. BTW, Prof. Hector likes to use graphic tools in homework, which is really helpful to build up a graphic understanding of Calculus. He also gives us a lot of supplementary materials like history of mathematics (not a must-do, though), which I find both fun to read and learn. 
During office hours, Prof. Hector is very laid back and likes to help students with their questions. He is not the sort of instructors who will ask how're your parents doing, but he is really friendly and tend to foster a close personal ties with his students as long as you are willing to ask him.

Don't know how this man has a silver nugget. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.
I entered expecting Avgousti to be competent and challenging, and while he was certainly challenging, his lecture style is far from competent. 
I'd often leave class with a jumble of nearly incomprehensible notes that were absolutely useless for studying for his midterm and final. He would get stuck on exploring a paradox within a work and never get around to lecturing as to the big picture and the actual objectives of the authors. 
Also, he picks names out of a jar to introduce something interesting to start off the discussion, but it was never clear exactly what he wanted from these presentations, and as the semester progressed (and less people did the readings), they became absolutely horrendous. 
Perhaps worst of all, he has an incredibly rude and condescending way of speaking in class (needs to show his students who is in charge or something).

This was an excellent course. Blattman managed convey exactly why development is so interesting by demonstrating how it's at the intersection of many, many fascinating subfields. The scope of the course is enormous, but the readings are well-chosen and I felt as though I'd ultimaetly read at least a bit of the key literature in every he discussed. Blattman's lectures were engaging, he was always well-prepared for class, and he clearly knows the material incredibly well. Perhaps most importantly, he did an effective job of connecting niche research projects to broader trends in the field and deep philosophical questions about development.  
That said, this class could be way, way better if Intermediate Macroeconomics or even just Principles of Econ were required as prerequisites. Watching Blattman -- who has a PhD in economics -- explain simple macro concepts to people who just haven't taken any econ was painful. If you know some econ beforehand, you will get significantly more out of this class.
The TA's for this class were terrible across the board, through no fault of Blattman's. They did not know the material and at times they took months to return assignments. My TA in particular would regularly cancel section because she overslept -- but that's okay, because section was pretty useless anyway.

I am not exaggerating when I say that Jay is one of the best professors I've ever had. His classes are lively, the discussions are interesting, and he is a fair grader. He comes prepared to each class with PowerPoint slides and up-to-date videos that relate directly to the texts. He is funny, charismatic, extremely intelligent and kind-hearted.
Jay makes sure his students understand the key details in each text which is beneficial in doing well on the exams. If you don't completely understand the readings or if you haven't had a chance to finish reading everything, Jay makes sure he explains the important ideas in the text so that you always leave class understanding at least the bulk of the material. 
His exams are fair as long as you take the time to make the study guide at home. You will get an A if you prepare the essays in advance and study the main ideas of each philosopher. The slides and videos Jay shares during classes are engaging, but make sure you take note of each one and not simply enjoy them because they usually end up on the exams. 
Before each class we take about 5-10 minutes discussing any news or personal stories students want to share rather than diving right into the teaching material. Overall, Jay treats his students with respect and never puts himself on a pedestal. His positive attitude implies that he is learning just as much from us as we are from him. 
I definitely recommend taking this class.

Vovsha is a very confident and organized lecturer. He has powerpoints of all the lecture slides he uses and his lectures are NOT just reading off the slides (or the textbook, for that matter).

 I'm writing this before the first midterm so I won't be biased by how well I do on it (i.e. I think I'll do well, and I don't want that coloring my opinion of a fairly bad class), but if last year's midterm, which we were given as study materials, is anything to go on it'll be comically awful. A good chunk of that midterm dealt with advertising engines' business decisions -- roughly, if they conduct their auction at time X, how does this impact their revenue? -- which has literally nothing to do with networks. In the case of another question, the correct answer was ""sledding in Morningside Heights."" (Don't ask.) 
I think the core of this review can be summed up in a single sentence: ""The lecture slides are in Comic Sans."" That fact captures the combination of a) trying a bit too hard to be cool (the professor has a pony tail) and b) totally failing to adhere to normal standards of professionalism.
Anyway, on to the review.
As others have noted, Chaintreau is an entertaining lecturer but very poorly organized. His assignments are poorly written to the point where virtually every question contains important ambiguities, and important terms and concepts are poorly specified, e.g. we are asked to find property X of a system, but there are multiple conflicting definitions of X and despite repeatedly being asked, the TAs and professor staunchly refuse to pick a particular one. 
The first programming project (a chat room) had virtually no networking component because you could just use Java or Python's network API; the whole thing amounted to basically just writing lots of switch statements to handle the umpteen-gazillion different chat room commands. 
The TAs try to be helpful, but their mastery of English is below what's needed to communicate effectively. (NB: This isn't true of just one or two. It's almost all of them. And students from past semesters tell me that's how it was then, too.) Whoever writes the problem sets has the same problem, which is probably a source of some of the ambiguity. That, or sloppiness. Often there are just words missing in the middle of a sentence. They also don't respond usefully to Piazza posts; a non-trivial share of posts get responses like ""well, I think X"", when what we want is not ""what do you think?"" but ""what is the official expectation for students in this class?""
As best I can tell, grading is arbitrary -- I'm doing well, so that's not sour grapes talking -- and the solutions are poorly written enough (and dependent enough on particular interpretations of ambiguities in the questions) that it's basically impossible to argue your grade.
Oh, and did I mention that the textbook sucks? It feels like one of those high school chem textbooks, in that it both doubles nicely as a doorstop and is jam-packed with unnecessary verbosity and cute little asides about real-world applications. There are glossy graphs, and maybe an equation every 30 or so pages. Not coincidentally, the book seems like it's written for a high school student, or maybe a smart middle school student. It is decidedly not written with the time constraints and intellect of a college student in mind, particularly not those who have spent enough time immersing themselves in CS to be taking a 4000-level class. Protocols are never proved correct, elementary concepts like a hash function are explained at length, and so on.
What this class needs is a big dose of rigor, not to mention a more disciplined professor. So, please, Columbia, can you get Jae Lee to teach this class, too? Give him a time-turning or something. I'm sure he'll do it.

I had professor Diebel for freshman year literature humanities and I have to say, she was one of the worst professors I've ever had. I've never written a review on here before, but I was so surprised to see that people gave her good reviews that I had to put in a comment. She doesn't say much of anything useful and seems to be on some sort of ego-boosting trip. As someone else mentioned, she'll always agree with people, even if they aren't saying much of anything worthwhile. Kids seem to participate just to get the grade (though this may be the same in other classes). She assigns a lot of work and pop quizzes and grades essays harshly, unless you go to her. She's one of those teachers that likes to have their ideas repeated back to them, and doesn't seem at all interested in letting you develop your own analysis. This is not a good professor for anyone who cares to get anything out of lithum.

My recommendation is to decide what kind of course you want to take and how interested you are in the topic. Professor Sassen is, no doubt, a brilliant sociologist with some influential ideas and interesting perspectives on globalization, urbanization, and the social repercussions of those processes. She is a passionate lecturer who is also quite funny and who very clearly knows a remarkable amount about the course material.
However, this class starts off somewhat structured and devolves into chaos over the course of the semester. Eventually it seems like the lectures don't follow the syllabus or any pattern at all- making it hard to follow what exactly you are supposed to be learning about ""global urbanism."" The readings are interesting but again, seem pretty random especially as the course goes on. Professor Sassen also doesn't even end up giving that many lectures, because she hands class over to the TA's who are supposed to lead some kind of clarification session (that you don't actually have to show up to). While it is a day off from class, it also makes you feel a bit cheated since you signed up to learn from a professor but got some random, unhelpful review sessions instead. 
All that being said, I did leave the class with an understanding of some of the major issues in globalization and urbanization as well as new perspectives to look at this issues from, and I gained this understanding through interesting readings and Professor Sassen's engaging lecture style. If you're looking for a more structured course that really helps you grasp the ideas, engage with them, and feel like you attended a cohesive set of lectures/classes---- do not take this class. It is scattered and disorganized. If you don't mind the chaotic nature of the class and are up for having a bunch of ideas and theories thrown at you for a semester, you'll probably enjoy it. These ideas and theories are, after all, interesting, important, and vaguely related to the topic of ""global urbanism.""

This is a solid class for anyone interested in the neuroscience behind brain development. The first half of the course focuses on the neuroscience specifics and biological processes involved in forming the infant brain. The second half touches on a variety of issues related to brain development like parental substance use, epigenetics, abuse and neglect, and how life experiences can actually biologically change brain structures as well- especially during development. While the focus is on the infant and young child's brain, the course does cover some issues related to adolescence. 
Professor Champagne is not an exciting lecturer, but she is clear, organized, and obviously very knowledgeable about the subject matter. She has power points for each lecture- though going to class is important since the power points alone are not enough to fully understand the material, and we followed the syllabus exactly, never veering off-topic or falling behind. You always had a clear idea of what her expectations of you were and where the course was going. 
Only drawback, again, is just that Professor Champagne is not a very engaging lecturer, nor is the class incredibly exciting even though it does touch on fascinating topics. 
Definitely recommend it for someone looking for a good introduction to various brain development issues who wouldn't mind being a bit bored sometimes.

I had O'Rourke for art hum last summer. Despite the short time-frame, she managed to make it an intellectually engaging and relatively painless experience. If you get her, do not switch out! She's obviously sort of brilliant but also engaging and actually quite funny. I went into the class with some serious skepticism and found to my surprise that it was so much more interesting and complicated than I would have guessed. By the end, I was definitely that annoying guy who puts his hand up to answer every question. If you have to sit through three straight hours of art hum, you would be hard-pressed to find a better instructor to do it with. She knows a ton, but still wants to hear what you think about things. The readings were a nice mix of contemporary and historical sources. I especially appreciated the emphasis on visual analysis and critical thinking over rote memorization. It was the best core class I've taken yet, and probably one of the best I've ever taken at Columbia. In sum: great instructor, fair grading, enjoyable experience.

This is not your grandfather's math class. Not your great-grandfather's either.

In fact, Gallagher is the most brilliant mathematician I have ever seen. He loves the material and enjoys teaching a lot, and sometimes tell jokes about Prof. Goldfeld (who was his student!) or other mathematicians. Try talk to him after class, especially if you want to major in Math. He has notes for all the math classes taught here and knows every professor the extremely well. He is absolutely the best adviser you can have. (Also ask him about what he did on Goldbach conjecture, what his middle initial X stands for, how does he translate Vietnamese songs to English  etc.)
The con side of this course are that Gallagher go over the more advanced stuff pretty fast(maybe because they are not the main focus of tis class). It can be pretty hard to grasp when it comes to Analysis. Another problem is the way he teaches is based on theorems and definitions, which can be really hard to understand. But you are more than welcomed to go to his office hours to ask him for a geometrical explanation or questions on any problem for any math class.
For the exams, midterms are straightforward, but final is something like 25 tricky true or false questions---they will be the most tricky true or false questions you will ever have unless you take another course with Prof. Gallagher.

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!
For those of you who are not dissuaded by the first statement, please let me elaborate.
It's quite sad that I have to tell you not to take this class because Pflugfelder is a great lecturer and attempts to be very engaging. However this class is ruined by unbearable required recitation and poor TA choice.
There are four TA's in the Spring 2015 class.
2/4  TA's are certifiably insane
1/4  obviously paid someone a good amount of money to take the TOEFL because her English is not understandable
1/4 appears to be normal
In this class the 2 crazy TA's pace the back of the lecture and torment students who are using their computers to distract themselves from the droning lecture. Personally I cannot pay attention during this class and the behavior of these 2 TA's serves as more of a distraction than a benefit to any persons involved. Instead they should just mind their own business and allow people to self-distract instead of not coming to class (due to this unnecessary policy).
TLDR: Japan studies grad students are crazy and ruin the class. Take rise of civ and hope that you get an A-.

This class was literally terrible. If you're interested in neoliberal, white savior complex human rights, then go ahead and take this class. I feel like John Martin doesn't know anything about human rights and that if I studied international law for a year I could do as good or better of a job. The TA doesn't know anything about human rights either - he's a lawyer and he said he was asked 3 weeks before the class started if he wanted to TA it. I literally did not learn anything of value the entire semester. John Martin's viewpoints are so limited and watered down, I find myself constantly confused by what he's saying and can't imagine that ideas would improve anyones life besides rich white people.

Denise Carroll is by far the worst professor I have every had both in high school and college. Perhaps some of the previous reviews had been posted prior to her complete lack of hearing and inability to follow a sentence. Although I cannot blame her for her extreme age, there are certain things a language teacher should be able to accomplish and hearing their students in order to correct them is one of them. We spend a good 15 minutes every class period trying to help her understand that what we originally said as our answer was correct or getting her to hear an answer in the first place. If she apologized and asked us to speak up, that would be one thing, but she gets angry at us for not answering questions we most certainly already have. 
On top of this, she is consistently 5-10 minutes late to class, does not follow the syllabus, and assigns random exercises that take hours to complete, and then never collects them. For instance, she asked us to prepare a 10 minute presentation on a European city for our class today, and at the end, says that she will have us present at random classes if there is time. 
She explains the most rudimentary concepts repeatedly, but often fails to address hugely important ones. I honestly learn more from looking things up online than I have ever from her. She also speaks French with a Belgian accent that is very hard to understand. 
I would avoid taking a class with her at all costs unless you already speak french and would be in it for the laughs..because at the end of the day, this class is so bad, it's comic.

I'm aware that almost everyone who takes this course is required to do so, but if you have any choice at all, stay far away. Take the course in another department if you can. Plan your four years at Columbia so that you never have to take this course.
This was hands down one of the worst courses I've ever taken at Columbia, which is sad because the subject matter is important for anyone interested in physics or engineering. Cole goes through each lecture at such a ridiculous pace that it is actually impossible to follow what he's saying in class. Most professors, when covering difficult material, make it a point to repeat important points more than once or tie the end of their argument back to the beginning, but Cole doesn't do any of this. To emphasise this contrast, another professor once substituted for Cole and the material during that lecture was perfectly comprehensible. The only option you have left is to copy down what Cole writes on the board and try to decipher it later, which is extremely difficult if not impossible for most people to do.
This brings me to the other sources of frustration in this class, homeworks and exams. Problem sets often take days to finish in groups. They are almost impossible to do alone. Worst of all, the problem sets do not actually test your understanding of the material and instead seem to be an assessment of whether you can find which textbook or website Cole has pulled the problems from so that you can search for the solutions. (Occasionally Cole writes his own problems which are even more painful to solve.) I cannot emphasise this enough: the homeworks in no way add to your understanding of the material. Anyone who has taken a physics course knows that you can't have a good grasp of the subject unless you've solved many problems and really understood how concepts can be applied to solve problems. The problem sets achieve none of this.
Exams do not necessarily test the material that has been covered in class. Quite frankly, considering the amount of real learning that happens in this class, it would be a surprise if they did. You normally end up using whatever you remember from intro physics courses in an attempt to solve the problems.
Cole also tends to get frustrated quickly when people ask questions and do not understand his answers. This course is a waste of tuition money and Columbia would do well to refund everybody who took it.

Worse teacher I have ever had. If you see that you have Jenny Boulboulle for CC, DROP OUT IMMEDIATELY. Switch sections, even if the only available section is with a very hard teacher at an 8:40am class.... To stay in Jenny Boulboulle's class is to learn nothing at all, thus wasting 100 dollars an hour for 4 hours a week being bored out of your mind by a ""teacher"" who does the reading at the same time as her students....Jenny Boulboulle is thoroughly unprepared to teach - not only CC because she hasn't read or understands the texts - but she cannot teach, period. She is even less capable of leading a class discussion, because she simply does not know what she is talking about. When students contribute a comment to the discussion, Jenny Boulboulle stares back at the student with blank, uncomprehending eyes, and then without a single word of acknowledgment of the comment, points to the next raised hand she sees. And so on, for the entire 2 hours. 
Not only is class incredibly dull, Jenny Boulboulle consistently demonstrates her belief that CC is the ONE AND ONLY class that each of her students take...she has no regard for course load, piles on reading and assignments over school breaks like Spring Break and Winter Break. She gives egregiously inconsistent examinations and requirements for papers and assignments...on one paper, she only wants completion grade (and won't hand back the papers until several months later, no exaggeration)... on the midterm exam, she out of the f**king blue decides that in a half page ""quote close-reading,"" she wants us actually to reference other authors from the last semester, and touch on all general themes and ideas of the entire book - opposite from what everyone has learned thus far to entail ""quote close-reading"". 
I could go on for days about why you must avoid Jenny Boulboulle at all costs. Save yourself the feeling of slowly withering away for 2 grueling hours with an incompetent teacher twice a week, only to be slammed with ridiculous expectations of reading material and ""take home midterm"" exams that take over 10 hours to complete... only for her to flippantly declare in class (read: not on paper, but to the whole class, because she cannot take the time to write valuable comments/explanations as to why you received a B- on an exam you spent a full week and 2 all-nighters on and was incredibly proud of). No explanation at all - and when a student asked for her reasoning, she straight up looked at the student and then IGNORED HER QUESTION.

His class seemed to be the ideal class which had just enough reading to be serious, a well-organized syllabus, and discussions that related directly to the readings. However, the readings began to relate less and less to the class and the class itself became about who he knows and what he is writing about. Don't get me wrong, the entire semester was incredibly fascinating. He also becomes increasingly frustrating. You really need to have thick skin when it comes to dealing with him. During our midterm presentations he was incredibly rude and acted like a middle schooler in a class he hates.

Professor Baswell changed my life. I went into The Canterbury Tales having half-read one Tale - not set on keeping the course past the shopping period.

Blanchard is by far my favorite teacher and Columbia and I try to take as many classes with him as possible
Admittedly, he's way better in smaller classes than lectures. Intro to IR with him can be boring, but in the way that every poli sci intro class is. But at least he has a witty personality, makes jokes, organizes his content in powerpoints (which he posts on line), and is fairly straight forward.
His grading on exams/papers can be harsh, but the class is curved in the end so it doesn't really matter (at least I'm assuming, because I had a B+/A- on everything and ended up with an A in the class)
Bonus: he's a feminist IR scholar (of which there are very few), so if you're interested in this aspect of IR then definitely take one of his more focused seminars or go to his office hours - he's fascinating and full of knowledge

Nancy Worman is one of the best professors I have ever had. As another reviewer put it, she is staggeringly intellectual without forgetting to be realistic, empathetic, and even sassy. She never sacrifices intellectual content in order to make it ""easy"" for students, but at the same time, she understands that not all students share the same background (I was a non-Classics major taking the course with a few very well-read Classics majors) and is completely willing to pause and explain a tricky theoretical concept. 
Most importantly, although she is indeed ""intimidating"" - as some other reviewers put it - in the sense that she's basically incredible, she will never talk down to students. And she is completely uninterested, unlike some brilliant professors, in having students fangirl over how perfect she is. (Although we do.)
I took Tragic Bodies to fulfill my visual arts requirement while staying as close to literature as possible, so that's my bias. But I think it was the most consistently interesting course I have ever taken. The syllabus begins with Greek drama and moves as the semester progresses to Shakespeare, Tennessee Williams, and movies like Paris is Burning, Her, and Peter Greenaway's creepy artsy films. Another feature I appreciated in the course is that it incorporates canonical and non-canonical works and theories seamlessly. You will read Greek drama and Kristeva, but you will also read Fugard, Hrotswitha, Bataille, etc. Anyways, I feel like I'm getting a little nitty-gritty here. The point is that this course is the best.

This will be a very specific review. First I'll support the many, many previous reviews that attest to how incredible Vandenburg is as a professor, a teacher, and person. Her content is interesting and challenging without being impossible, and in addition, she is ALWAYS there for students outside of office hours. 
The important additional claim that I want to make, however, is about how ""phallic"" or whatever her course is. As past reviewers have pointed out, Vandenburg likes Freud and Lacan, argues that Virginia Woolf embeds androgyny in To The Lighthouse, etc. The thing that people seem to forget is that while it's clearly true that ""androgyny"" is Vandenburg's main theoretical interest, she is not teaching Modernism because she loves imposing weird Freudian imagery onto literature. She is teaching Modernism because the Modernists ACTUALLY WERE a group of people who literally read and wrote about Freud ALL THE TIME, and WERE unhealthily obsessed with the phallus and escaping femininity (or, for the few women, with escaping the phallus). This can be attested to, if you don't ""see it"" in their books, by the actual books that the Modernists read, by their letters, etc. In other words, it might be that Freud isn't your cup of tea -- Cool. You don't have to be a Modernist. You should still probably read their works through, because they're fucking great.

My first year at Barnard would have been way worse without Masha every morning. She is really incredible. Our class was small- 5-8 students. We all bonded with her and our class had this incredibly fun, loving, and engaging dynamic. Masha is a really interesting person and so sometimes we would get distracted from our lesson and talk about life and tell stories. Usually when we did this, we would talk in French so I felt like my French were really improving because I was learning to converse about normal stuff in French. She is really good at explaining stuff, but if you do the very light reading and the worksheets and you participate, this class should not be hard.
Masha really cares about our learning and our interest and it really shows. My whole class adores her, and one boy even scheduled our class during his mandatory Core class and skipped it just so he could take Masha's class. On holidays she will bring bags and bags of Dylan's Candy Bar candy and give it to us to take home, and twice we also had a fancy cheese and cracker party. I feel like I've learned so much French and that I really wanted to learn it and enjoyed it. 
She is a badass- she will not take shit from you so don't try and pull anything over her. ALWAYS print your essays and bring them to class. Don't skip unless you have a good reason and she really likes you. She has a lot of really fascinating stories and a ridiculous background so get to know her if you get the chance. Respect her, and she will respect you.

I absolutely loved this class, and Milnor definitely contributed to that. The nature of this class is that the professor doesn't participate in class very much, but she did a great job of introducing the set up of the game and giving us help with our characters and papers. 
Honestly, this class turned a little cultish and we loved it. We had such a good time that we scheduled a class dinner at Symposium and Milnor came and somehow used a budget to get it all paid for, which was awesome. We got to talk to Milnor and it was so fun. She told us that our class was the best she ever had, sooo that's pretty cool. We all had such a fantastic and ridiculous time arguing and having crazy things happen. I would absolutely recommend this class to students who love participating and debating, like history, and are willing to take some risks. If you are scared or bad at public speaking or dislike being involved, this class will definitely not be as fun for you. Some kids just never participated and they missed out.

I am not a math person and I dislike calculus, and the only reason I kept showing up to lecture was because Dave is hilarious. He's young and nerdy and ridiculous. I would just laugh at him all class. He makes the best jokes which are usually very out of the blue and bizarre. He also is quite a good teacher, definitely one of the best math teachers I've ever encountered. Although I got a C- in this class, it wasn't anything he did wrong (I just hate math). He was available and helpful and friendly during office hours, and always answered questions during class. I think he's a great professor for a hard subject. Always in a good mood.

Professor Sever is probably the most incompetent professor I have ever encountered here at Barnard and Columbia.  First off, she is extremely unreliable in handing back assignments and tests.  I have to say, she was quite good with the first test, but we have not gotten back our second test and it has been over two weeks.  Furthermore, we haven't gotten back our problem sets from several weeks ago; she also is not timely in posting solutions to the problem sets on Courseworks.  Furthermore, the problem sets are difficult and students do put in effort into them, but she doesn't even to bother to check them; the few problem sets that we have gotten back have no markings on them whatsoever.  
She is also a very poor lecturer, simply reading off the slides that she posts.  She also frequently says wrong information in class, someone will point it out, and then she'll get confused and flustered and ultimately confuse the rest of the class.  She is not responsible; one time, she missed a recitation section and we all waited for her to show up for twenty minutes!  It's super disappointing to be in a challenging class and to not have a professor who is responsible and reliable.  Professor Sever has really confirmed the inadequacies of the Chemistry Department at Barnard.

Overall it's an interesting class. At times there's more of a focus on Indian cultural rather than the religion itself.  There is a lot of assigned reading - 100-200 pages a week and you should probably do them because the lecture will not prepare you for the exams or papers. Grading really depends on the TA's, they weren't very lenient this year. 
Keep in mind that a lot of students taking the class come from Hindu backgrounds and this can discourage you at times but if you do the readings you'll be fine for papers. For the Midterm you're given a list of 60 terms and you're told you'll have to talk about 5 of them on the exam for the first part. The second part will be a random essay topic. Final is similar.

This review is for the course project COMS E6901.
Apoorv Agarwal is the most unprofessional person to work with. He has absolutely no proper schedules when it comes to working with project students, and is very demanding and inconsiderate towards other priorities such as coursework.
His goals kept shifting during the project and was different from what he discussed at the start. He is very disrespectful and rude. He is quick to blame without proof and sends impolite emails without giving you a chance to get back and reply. The meetings that are scheduled, usually left me waiting. He would change deadlines as per convenience and would expect you to work through vacations, and entire nights. In spite of communicating results, etc through emails and documentations, he ignores those and continues to ask for the same multiple times, which is annoying for the other person.
He keeps shooting work giving short notices and when asked for some time due to other coursework conflict, he would intimidate saying grades would be affected. He asked for writeup, other questions about the work I did after the semester ended. These are not clarifications  but those which had been explained during the semester. Though my deliverables were timely and documentation to support it, he still had many questions, often asked with sarcasm and insults.
He gets a lot of his work done from students for his PhD. Being a student himself, he treats students working with him with such disrespect. His advisor Owen Rambow was not involved at all in the project, but ended up coming on the research fair as if it is a project with him or at least you would expect he would be involved since he showed up and spoke with you, but that was not the case in reality.
It is a horrible idea to do a project with him in my opinion, it is a waste of your tuition money! It is like paying to do work rather than getting paid! I would strongly suggest taking up coursework rather than a project with Apoorv Agarwal. My purpose was to have a good research and learning experience, but was completely the opposite!

I have trouble understanding those who say that Prof. Lax's class is disorganized. While the pace is fast, there is a definite structure to his course; you begin with the basics of sentential logic, and as you move through the semester he gives you additional tools and methods which outline decision-making processes and group dynamics, and which ultimately yield some pretty interesting conclusions! The class is especially valuable if you're a poli. sci. major like me (and I assume that most of you are); you will definitely look at democracy and social decision-making differently. In any case, there is at least a handful of professors whom I have had at Columbia who are worse than Lax, so take the vitriol on some of these reviews with a grain of salt... 
The important thing to remember is (1) take lots of handwritten notes--there is no textbook and NO useful information online, and representing the logical symbols on a laptop is just a chore; (2) pay attention in class--it's not that hard to do, because he's always cracking jokes (which can be pretty bad, admittedly, but at least entertaining); and (3) just do your problem sets well ahead of their due date, talk to the T.A., and attend the review sessions for the exams, and you'll do fine. Trust me. 

Workload:
Problem sets maybe twice a month, two mid-terms and a final. Problem sets require about an hour each if you've paid attention, and are straight-forward.

Consider the exceptions to rules, because he loves to test you on those (as all teachers of logical methods do, apparently...)

Professor Moore's class is absolutely excellent. The syllabus provides for a very broad range of discussion on Black life in America from a variety of angles including race and gender, race and politics, race and motherhood, race and cultural capital and many others. While it is a lecture course, Professor Moore really encourages discussion and often wants us to voice our opinions on what we are learning. She also encourages us to relate our own lives and experiences to the content regardless of racial identification. It is an eye-opening and thought provoking class that I would definitely recommend to anyone from a freshman, which I was when taking this course, to sociology majors, which the majority of my classmates were.

Professor Cohen is fierce, smart as a whip, and a bit scattered. Expect no emails longer than a sentence, cozy office hours, or gentle let-downs. Do expect to learn from a scholar who knows her stuff like no one else and teaches the texts as theory more than literature. By the standards of Contemporary Civilization, this class will include relatively little discussion. Thorough notes of her perspective on the text is absolutely crucial for the 1-2 papers, midterm, and final. Both exams comprise essays. She is a stickler for use of clear language and her own ideas (but her ideas may well be better than yours - at least better than mine - so that is not such a big deal). She will not tolerate questions about grading or rubrics, which she sees as secondary to the actual business of learning.

Ken Light is probably the most well-intentioned professor one could imagine. Yes, learning the very basics of APA style and how to graph on excel can be boring at best, Prof Light is ready and willing to help you every step of the way. It's unfortunate that the class is 3 hours once a week because it's hard to remain engaged from week to week. At the end of the day, he's really there because he wants you to succeed. He's very available via email and in person, to answer any and all questions. He writes very clearly on the board, which is almost unnecessary, but honestly very appreciated. If you're ever confused about anything at all, he's willing to explain. Also, as another reviewer said, he's really helpful about getting you into a section. At the beginning of the semester, he has everyone fill out a form with their top choice sections so that he can get everyone (or everyone he can) into a section that fits their schedule. I didn't get into the section I was originally on the waitlist for, but then he accidentally put me in a section that didn't fit in my schedule. When I told him, he was very apologetic and actually asked another girl to switch into my section so that I could still take the class because he did have a space for me.

Professor Remez is an incredible lecturer.
If you absolutely, with no wiggle room, need to stick to the syllabus and have clear idea of what is relevant to the exam in every lecture, he may not be for you. 
His lectures are more conversational and involved than powerpoint-style organized. Tangents are frequent,  but always interesting. Questions at all related to the material are welcomed (though he may come back to it later if the class needs to cover a lot). Professor Remez is clearly passionate about not only his field, but about applications of his field in other disciplines. 
If anecdotes help you understand concepts, his lectures can really help to lock down the information you get from the book. If at the end of the lecture you have a pile of unanswered questions, is office hours can either be getting bullet point answers to them all, or talking in depth about the ones you are more interested in/worried about. Either way, you lead the office hours how you want them to go. 
It's not very difficult at all. All you have to do is be engaged in lectures, at least skim the book (though reading helps with context in lecture), and go to office hours a couple of times. The three midterms are pretty straight forward. 
I would definitely recommend this class to any one who is passionately interested in psych, but not necessarily to those who are looking for a lab credit and are indifferent about the material. It's an amazing experience, but I can see how the lecture could be frustrating if you're not all that curious about the ins and outs of his field.

This is by far the most interesting and enriching class I have taken in the history department at Columbia University. And Joel Kaye is an extraordinary professor. This is by no means an exaggeration. This is one of the classes that will leave a mark on you.
Regardless of what you may think about the Middle Ages, you will come out of this class fascinated by what you have learned. This class will open a world of knowledge and it will shed new light on the origins of the modern world. Professor Kaye often takes a moment to reflect about the way history unfolds and invites students to think with him. He always creates a comfortable and engaging environment.
This class will train you to think historically. You will mostly work with primary sources, which includes philosophical, religious, and literary materials. Instead of always giving bland lectures, Professor Kaye spends some time analyzing the sources during most classes, so he really brings the material to life, which makes it much easier and pleasant for students.
The course is writing intensive. There are 3 essay assignments, which comprise most of the work. There is also a final, but it is light and nothing to worry about. The essays are not easy, but they are exciting. Professor Kaye is also a fair grader who really gives his students the means to do great in the class. He gives thorough comments on each paper and makes time to give serious advice and feedback in person. Even if you already consider yourself a good writer, this class can really improve your writing skills.  
This class will have applications for you beyond the Middle Ages and beyond the discipline of history. I highly recommend it.

The way that Prof Martin conducted this class was appalling. The review before mine was right- he teaches from a neoliberal white savior complex point of view that can sometimes be so naive and offensive that I have to get up and leave class to take a breath and come back. He has referred to Africa, ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS, as an entire country. Apparently he did field work in several countries there, however he failed to recognize the distinct differences between countries, cultures, and the human rights violations/concerns that different countries deal with. 
On another note, the class itself, despite his disgusting rhetoric, is unorganized and a waste of time. The way he goes over the readings is terrible; he essentially just reads through the whole text and calls it a discussion because he asks a few arbitrary questions that no one wants to answer- you might as well not read beforehand. I don't. I have an A in the class.. The only reason I did well on the midterm was because of the definition sheet he put on the syllabus. No, he did not go over most of these definitions in class. I taught myself through google and the text book. Which reminds me-- the textbook is written from the same white, privileged, naive, ignorant perspective that Prof. Martin teaches from. 
If you'd like to learn what it's like to live inside the head of an old British man who was a former missionary (yes, missionary) in Africa who only wears monochrome corduroy suits, this class is for you. If you want to have an engaging, interesting class that discusses the nuances of the current HR structures in place in the modern world, stay the fuck away. 

Do not take this class. After the first few weeks most people just stopped showing up because he simply stands in front of the class blathering on about random texts he reads off of the internet and the poor little people in Africa.

I found this a fun class that was good for maintaining my current language level without doing a ridiculous amount of work. If you're looking to improve your grammar or oral ability significantly however, this is probably not the class.
Class generally involved a light amount of reading, or watching a film beforehand, which we then discussed. Mme Jouanneau-Fertig was good at pushing everyone to speak and I felt she tried to use the occasion to really know you.
All in, she's a good professor and a kind lady who goes out of her way to help her students, especially if they're going abroad to study or hoping to do graduate work in France. You won't see great improvement in your French from this, but that's not what this class was designed to do.

I took the Barnard equivalent of Methods and Problems, and while it was good, I appreciated that Albert took a less structured approach.

I would highly recommend taking the course with him, and YouTubing some of his talks because he always has something interesting to say.

Honestly, I am outraged seeing the comments below.  I don't know how anybody can claim that Ken Light is a good professor, because frankly he is the worst professor I have had in my time here at Barnard.  The reasons are many, so I decided to number them:
1.  Do not think that he cares at all about your success in this class.  He does not.  He can and WILL dock you about ten points for slight formatting errors, not caring at all that this is an intro class and we don't all know how to write perfectly formatted APA papers.  Today, he walked into class and announced that no one had done as well on the essays as he had hoped.  As I looked around me, I saw seventies, eighties, and nothing in the nineties.  The man does not like to give good grades, period.
2.  His absurdly harsh grading might be understandable if he only explained assignments well.  Once again, he does not.  You would think somebody would realize, if less than half of the class got a decent grade on a paper, that he was doing something wrong as a professor.  He truly does not explain the formatting thoroughly, and WILL dock you points if you get something wrong that he didn't explain thoroughly.
3.  His comments on papers and presentations are rude, abrasive, harsh, and bordering on unprofessional.  He has no problem telling you that your slight formatting error is ""completely and totally unacceptable"" or that you ""would have been docked more points if I wasn't being nice.""  Simply put, he's mean.  He will make you feel bad about yourself.
4.  Once again, I can't stress this enough - it is absurdly difficult to get good grades on certain assignments.  Often times, it seems like it all boils down to luck.  You're honestly lucky if you get all his nitpicky formatting right.  And if you have a bad lab group, good luck; he WILL decide he doesn't like your lab group, and he WILL target you and grade you unfairly.
5.  This brings me to my next point.  If he doesn't like you for whatever reason, and it could be the fault of someone in your lab group, he will grade you unfairly.  
6.  Come on, guys.  I shouldn't see a classroom full of seventies and eighties on papers; he obviously gets pleasure out of giving bad grades.
There has to be better lab professors.  If I could have not done a lab this semester and held off until I could have a better professor, I would have.  Ken Light was not worth it.  A 1.5 CREDIT CLASS SHOULDN'T BE MY HARDEST CLASS, AND IT SHOULDN'T BE THE ONLY CLASS INDUCING PANIC ATTACKS.

Absolutely ridiculous for a 1.5 credit class.  You will have an assignment every week, and good luck not getting anything wrong.  Maybe you'll write your name wrong in the heading and get ten points knocked off...(not even an exaggeration.)

Incredible, life changing class. Professor Maldonado-Torres is the most incredible professor I've ever had. He is really invested in the class, knows his stuff, and is invested in the students. Don't be put off by the first class where he talks logistics of the course the whole time. It gets 10000000xs better from there. His lectures are engaging and sometimes funny. The course is extremely relevant and the professor connects current day events to the texts we are reading. He's super helpful and responsive and is always willing to chat or hear your ideas.

Really challenging material at times, but he always explained it in depth during class. I'd suggest not taking the course if you have absolutely no interest in latin american / colonial studies because that's all this class  is. If you're looking to take any other course with Orlando I say to do it, he's super chill about like any assignment and is very flexible with the syllabus. 
If you do end up in his class, just be honest when he asks for questions. He seems to genuinely enjoy clarifying any of the readings.

I have never once given CULPA reviews the benefit of the doubt until I took Brendan O'Flaherty's class. If I could turn back the clock and take a different professor, I would do so. I have never met a more inarticulate, Harvard Ph.D in my entire life. His lectures can be interesting and occasionally humorous, but he will put you to sleep.
My biggest concern: His problem sets. He is absolutely horrible at phrasing questions and letting you know what he wants you to include in your answer. He lets you use Piazza to ask questions, but his advanced age is evident in his use of the website. His internet grammar makes the average YouTube troll look like an articulate, well-informed member of society. And the way he answers questions on Piazza is cryptic and makes just as much ""sense"" as the question he asked in the first place.
Pro: Because his problem sets are absolute bullshit, they're easy to knock out in a few hours if you use Google, but good luck getting the same results on the test. He will justify any grading mistakes he makes in the most ridiculous way possible.

It's surprising that someone could be such a bad lecturer.  She speaks in a monotone voice and is able to make even psychology seen super boring.  In many lectures she says, ""You will not need to know this for the exam"" and i am shocked that we spend so much class going too much in depth on neuroscience and complex experiments that we don't need to know for the exam.  Her power points are mainly just graphs and images with only the broadest main points listed, making them hard to study from if you miss class.  
However, she pretty much follows the book and the material is relatively easy to learn.  Over half the class was taking the course for the science requirement which brought in a curve for the exam.

Professor Smoliarova's Lit Hum class is one of the most enjoyable classes I have taken during my time at Columbia. She has no arrogance about her even though she is obviously brilliant. She requests the class call her by her first name, something not often done by professors. 
She strikes a beautiful balance in the classroom of leading the discussion while engaging the class and having us chime in with what we think. She will keep conversation going but always wants to hear what we think.  
I would take pretty much any class she is teaching because she is not just a teacher in the classroom but genuinely cares about her students and their concerns. If something is going on in your life she understands you and will work with you one on one to catch up with the material--without you even asking but with her approaching you.

Professor Graham has been my favorite teacher at Columbia thus far. He has a strong command over the material, and is incredibly eloquent in presenting it. He is a “to the book” kind of professor, meaning he doesn’t believe in adding or subtracting from the typical lit hum syllabus. You know exactly what you are getting from him. 
In terms of grading, Professor Graham is incredibly fair. Visiting his office hours before a paper is due is a must. He gives incredible advice and direction in his discussions during office hours. When he gives a paper back, he provides literally a page of feedback about your paper and how he thinks you are progressing as a writer. I have never seen a professor more dedicated to his student’s progression.
Previous reviews of Professor Graham state that you can get by if you just read sparknotes. While that may be true, Professor Graham loves delving into texts and digging up its meaning, so reading the books is incredibly helpful. 
If you get Professor Graham, just know that means you have to participate in class discussions. A third of your final grade is participation, so that is definitely the difference between a B+ and an A-. 
If you are a first year, stick with Professor Graham.

I'm so damn bored in this class that I feel compelled to write my first CULPA review. I really cannot state enough that this one of the worst classes I have taken at Columbia. Sure, I'll totally concede that the subject matter is intriguing and that I enjoy reading the textbook, but the rest of the class is an absolute farce. Class participation seems to be entirely based on mandatory attendance and the occasional poorly supported claims people make in class. Furthermore, Vargas-Ramos is awful. Not only is he an incredibly boring professor, pretty much just reading eyes-to-notes in complete monotone and racing through powerpoint slides (which no one takes notes on because let's be real, what's the point), but I also find him quite annoying and oftentimes patronizing. Typical class-participation dialogue:
Professor: What is the reason [insert dumbly obvious question stated word-for-word in reading]?
Student: Bla bla bla... The American Dream—
Professor: And what is the American Dream?
Student: Bla bla bla...
Professor: And what does that mean to you?
Student: [Insert completely subjective comment that has no relevance to the course]
Stupid stuff like this happens all the time. Vargas-Ramos has no distinction between the necessary and the stupid. All is fair game.
Pretty much the remainder of the class involves writing: choice between paper and five written responses. The written responses are more a waste of time than FroSci in its entirety. These involve literal regurgitation of the readings. No analysis necessary, that's too difficult!
TL;DR: This class feels more dumbed down than any of my high school courses. Vargas-Ramos has no concept for what affects interest and true learning.

Professor Watson is an incredibly nice woman who is very approachable and receptive to helping students. That being said, I didn't think she was a great professor. 
I wanted to get a lot out of uwriting and develop into a better writer. However, I don't think Professor Watson is the best teacher in terms of helping students grow as writers. Professor Watson will rarely/never edit your grammar, so if you aren't good at that, then this may be the class for you. She is much more focused on bigger ideas and the content than on the style of your writing.
Perhaps the biggest flaw I found in Professor Watson was the randomness in giving out grades. Each time I thought I wrote an excellent paper, I received a B, and each time I thought my paper was below average, I somehow conjured an A. She does provide an extra credit opportunity at the end of the semester, but in general, her grading is totally subjective and random.
I recommend going to her office hours and talking through her comments with you. 
 
Workload:
Probably less than average for uwriting. Many of my friends who took uwriting constantly complained about a ton of readings, but Professor Watson doesn't give too many. As for the writing, all uwriting classes have 4 progressions with similar deadlines. Her class is no different.

Ok lets get one thing clear, Ochsner is amazing at what he does and has accomplished many things. So, there are two people. One is the type of person that success does not affect them in any way shape or form. The other type is the one that inflates their ego. Unfortunately he tends to side with the second type of person. HOWEVER, this is Columbia University and the man knows his things! You're in an Ivy not in high school where ""everyone is important and must feel warm embraces every time they open their mouths."" Yes he is a bit egotistical but he never made any students in the class I was in feel badly about themselves. With that said, if you are the typical young student who thinks they're the best thing since sliced bread and you raise your hand to not ask a question but to simply try to impress him like many young CC students do (I'm GS), then he will very quickly make sure his class isn’t interrupted by someone who is a showoff. This is amazing! It keeps the class going smoothly. He loves it when the class participates and will ask many questions throughout class. He expects students to participate. You will learn a lot.

I took FYS - The Enchanted Imagination the first semester of my freshman year, and it was (hands down) THE best class I've ever taken.  It's not merely the interesting theme and readings; Professor Pagano simply took the entire experience to the next level, and nothing can ever top that.
Professor Pagano is more than a professor to all the students in the Seminar: he is an approachable man with a big heart, and only wants to be there to help you make the best of this class.  By the second day, he already has not only our names, but also our hometowns and prospective majors down as if he had known us for weeks.  As a professor, he is one of the most passionate teachers I've ever encountered.  He knows the material virtually by heart (not to mention the fact that he's able to recite the entire poem Rime of the Ancient Mariner), and his love for fantasy and literature has been absolutely contagious.  He is well-prepared for the class, and is able to provide new ideas when the discussion falls short.  He highly encourages self-expression, and is very open minded when students present their own opinions.  Thus, every class is like looking at the world in multiple lenses, which is made possible because Professor Pagano would never impose his opinion on you.  While he does have the tendency to digress, it's never for more than a minute, and we are always back on track after two sentences tops.  His fatherly energy also brings in a homey feeling the second one walks into the classroom, and the chemistry amongst the students was cultivated by the end of the first week.  The bonds between not only the individual student and Professor Pagano, but also said student and her peers have grown to be very strong thanks to Professor Pagano's aura and passion.  Professor Pagano is also one of those professors who loves keeping in touch with former students, and is willing to make time to meet them and catch up.  In other words, he's a wonderful professor, moderator and human being, and he will make you unconsciously want to do well in this class for reasons far beyond merely understanding the literature or having a wonderful GPA.
Personally, I've always walked out of Seminar feeling like I had just been through something life-changing, no matter how small - something I rarely feel with my other classes.  His insights on the readings has been very inspirational, and many students leave the class with a more positive attitude towards life.  Basically, he's a great professor teaching a great class, and this will gift you with one of the most memorable classroom experiences in your college career - one that you will look back on and be eternally grateful for the experience.

The worst professor I've ever had. The worst lecturer, cares waaaay too much about his class, nitpicky, critical, dry and uninspired. He finds joy out of forcing his students to sit through his monotonous lectures for three hours. He makes you do group projects that take weeks to complete. He needs to chill. I don't know why he hasn't been fired yet.

If you're reading this because you just discovered that you got Liza Knapp as your Lit Hum instructor -- breathe a sigh of relief, because you're in for an amazing experience. I honestly don't know why Liza doesn't have a gold nugget yet, because she is certainly deserving of one. Out of all the teachers and professors I've had in the course of my education, I don't think I've quite met someone so passionate and enthusiastic and eccentric as she is when it comes to reading these texts. Liza will gasp, ooh, ah, and scream out whenever someone says something interesting or she comes up with an exciting new idea, which definitely keeps you on your toes. It's pretty hard to fall asleep in her class because she's too excited about the literature for you to not get pretty excited about it yourself. I personally have never been a really big English Lit kind of person, but I found a serious enjoyment in reading most of the books because of the way Professor Knapp taught them to us. 
That being said, I will list whatever can possibly be seen as a negative to this course. Liza does make her own distinct midterm and finals, which tend to be longer and can be seen as more difficult than exams seen in other courses. Her quote IDs, however, are abundantly obvious and beyond fair (they're almost impossible to miss, so don't sweat these, she just cares that you can analyze themes and whatnot). Her essays can be a bit long or difficult to answer, but are usually fun and interesting prompts that provoke thought and force you to be creative and connect the books from the syllabus.
Overall, I wouldn't trade my experience with Liza as my lit hum instructor for any other professor at this university. Her kindness and enthusiasm goes a long way in this class, considering a lot of my friends who had less than great professors ended up hating lit hum. I, however, love it, and going to class is always exciting. Also, if you're interested in the English Lit department at all, take another one of her classes. You won't be sorry.

Typical lit hum workload -- try to keep up with all reading, realize you can't, and bs your way through discussions on the days you didn't have time to read. 
3 essays per semester - each one is 1,000 - 1,250 words. Not long to write, but she is very particular on writing style and ideas and whatnot, so don't expect the best grades ever on these.
Midterm, final - IDs are a cakewalk, you can't miss them. Essays can be long and thought provoking, but definitely nothing you can't handle if you have a decent grasp on the general ideas in lit hum.

I took this class despite the mediocre reviews on CULPA and I was so pleasantly surprised! 
The class gets off to a slow start and feels like a very broad intro level course, but it is interesting and gives a basic understanding of race in America. Professor Smith is a funny and engaging lecturer. He doesn't use slides, but rather a document projector so get ready to take good notes. That being said, it's okay to miss a few classes as long as you do the readings. Keep in mind that you don't always have to agree with the course material he assigns and that you're meant to engage with it. The paper topics are engaging and creative. Professor Smith makes an effort to get to know the students in the big lecture class as best he can and is super friendly. He also includes current events in the class and leaves them up for discussion. I think his sense of humor can be hard to catch and seem pretty harsh, but if you get used to it you can see he's a really caring softy.

This class was probably the most immediately applicable class I ever took, and it's easy, too.  Jae teaches you C, much like in the Advanced Programming Course, with an emphasis on the subtleties of memory allocation and pointers.  In the last 5-ish weeks you make the transition to C++ and focus on references and object-oriented structure.  During all of this, you're also learning about fundamental data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs.  It's a crash course in everything you need to know to get your foot in the door for programming and helps a lot for physics, chemistry, economics, or whatever you're trying to do (if you're not a comp sci major).  Highly recommend it.

Professor Ko is the best professor I've had at Columbia all year. Her lectures are funny and engaging-- she won't spoon feed you the reading, but rather work to explain the full historical moment and place the reading in context. She *will* ask that you participate and answer incredibly difficult/leading questions, and you shouldn't be afraid to. 
She's very good at making sure white people don't dominate and derail a conversation about China, especially in a room full of women of color-- she's super mindful of class dynamics. Professor Ko is real about asking white students to check their orientalist impulses and encouraging students of color to be more forthcoming and bold in their answers. I found this to be incredibly empowering as a student of color. 
She's also genuinely the kindest person in Office Hours. I've gone to talk to her about articles I've read, about pursuing a history major. She is serious about mentoring younger women of color who want to go into academia and is *very* serious about her teaching in general. Professor Ko truly goes out of her way to help you.

For a class on quality control, it is tragically ironic how poor this one was.
Ullman is well-intentioned, but possibly one of the worst lecturers here. He makes mistakes often, is scatterbrained and jumps to topics haphazardly, and has no idea how to set expectations of the class. He probably will not be back to teach the next rotation, but it constantly amazes me who this university will hire.
I learned nothing regarding quality control, except how to plug in numbers into an excel sheet and spit back esoteric jargon that was never put into context or made significant. It was all quite the dead-end. He doesn't use slides, which is probably why his lectures are so roundabout and twisted. It is also the reason why we are constantly trailing the syllabus, as he revises the schedule so much that it loses all significance.

ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS CLASS. I thoroughly enjoyed the History of the City of New York with Professor Sullivan. The man is a walking fount of historical knowledge of NYC. I thought the curriculum was planned out well for a twice weekly class, meeting one day for lecture and one day for a walking tour to various sites such as Central Park, the Lower East Side, lower Manhattan, and Brooklyn Heights. Professor Sullivan often added his own personal anecdotes to both lectures and walking tours which made the class more interesting. It's also a perfect class to take during the summer session since we had beautiful weather for all of our walking tours and it sure beat sitting inside a classroom. Stephen does go off on tangents (as he admits) but I find his lecturing style refreshing. But he really shines as a tour guide because of his vast knowledge of the city. As a native New Yorker who thought knew everything about the city, I was amazed of how much I actually didn't know about the city. 
The bottom line: If you love both history and New York City, then I wholeheartedly recommend this class. It was the fastest (and most enjoyable) 6 weeks I have ever spent in a class at Columbia.

   I found the experiments and dissections to be interesting, but hated the lab reports and felt they were huge waste of time and our TA's grading was harsh. I didn't feel that I learned anything more about Biololgy than I did from my intro course,  I just spent allot of time doing calculations and trying to figure out how to make interesting pictures of plasmids on my computer.  As someone who wasn't fond of the class I can say that the professor is probably one of the nicest I've had at columbia and made it allot less painful. I recommend taking it in the summer when it won't interfere with other classes. The lab reports are very time consuming and, of course, are heavy right before finals. If you have a cool TA, this class will be much better for you. But you're not going to find that out until it's too late anyway.

Wijnie is amazing. I only took one semester with her (because I didn't care for my classmates and, in a course like Dutch in the US, your current class is who'll have until I2) but it was a fantastic time. She's incredibly down to earth, even helping students find free textbooks because she didn't know they were so expensive! She's from The Netherlands and knows all about the culture and the language. I highly recommend her to anyone interested in actually learning this under appreciated language.

I have mixed emotions about this class.  First off, the class itself is really great and straightforward.  Professor Van de Mieroop does a really good job explaining the different periods of Egypt.  This is definitely a class to take to fulfill a Global Core.  The assignments and midterm were not that difficult, it's the TA's that were awful.  Your grade entirely rests on your TA and depending on which one you are assigned, you can either have a really chill one or a up tight one.  My TA is down right awful and has really ruined my experience with this class.  I would take this class again but make sure you get a good TA.

I. Love. This. Class. No, seriously. Eric Blanchard is the man. I mean, yes he makes small stupid jokes in class, but everyone laughs and actually enjoys him. i don't see him being disorganized at all; before class, he basically outlines the major points of the class on the board in headings and bullet points and goes through each one clearly. The review for the exams was so comprehensive. Now onto the course material. This class is really incredible. The course material explores the various roles of women across the globe, from the more obvious domestic roles to the not-so-obvious public sphere and warrior roles. The best aspect of the class is that you study things that are severely understudied, material you likely would not encounter in other classes. It also gives you a whole new framework with which to view injustice. Yes, there are a lot of readings and you get out of the class what you put into it, but the work is absolutely nothing even close to unmanageable. You also don't have to do ALL of them in depth, but they really are interesting if this is what you want to study. He also only gives you one of his own writings, which is a rarity. He encourages discussion and debate in class and forces you to think about the concepts. Also, his midterm and final are so clearly defined; he gives you 20 possible IDs that will be on the exam and picks 5. The essay questions are so open that its really impossible not to have anything to write about. Tells you exactly what elements he wants to see in the responses and does not try to trick you at all. The grading, however, is a bit harsh.

Professor Morrison is one of the worst professors I have experienced in terms of caring that his students learn the material.  He is a decent lecturer but makes it difficult for his students to succeed. There are no answer keys for any problem sets, quizzes, midterm exams or even practice exams, because professor wants to prevent cheating (a situation in which an upper year student passes on an answer key). However, this also results in students simply not knowing the correct answer with no way to find out besides office hours. Problem sets are returned with barely more than a score; midterms and quizzes are the same. 
I understand that the professor is trying to prevent cheating for his exams. Perhaps he can make different exams for different years? Just a thought. He says that we can visit his office hours to ask for some answers. Perhaps he has not considered that students have other classes or part-time jobs and may not be able to make his and the TAs office hours.

I cannot say enough good things about Simona Vaidean, I've never had such an amazing professor. She came in every day with a smile on her face, even if she had a hectic morning with her two kids. The students in our class contributed to this as well, but she created a friendly and fun environment in which to learn, something invaluable when the class meets for 2 hours, 4 days a week.
She is very kind, understanding, and genuinely cares about her students. She knows that we are trying to learn a ton in a very short time, so she makes it easier on us whenever possible. I was deliberating between taking accelerated versus elementary I, but when I saw the previous post about how great Simona was, I chose to take her class. I am so happy that I did. It was a pleasure to have her as a professor, and I strongly recommend you take a class with her if you have the chance.

I took this class Spring 2015 with Professor Jeon and would recommend him at least for a silver nugget.
He is the first mathematics professor I have encountered here that uses colored chalk, and it greatly helps in gaining a visual understanding of the material. He explains most steps very clearly, and if a student does not know how to get from one step to another, he'll answer the question right there. Sometimes his handwriting can be a bit unclear, but because he writes down most of the steps, it's easy to follow his work and point out any (rare) mistakes he makes on the chalkboard.
He also takes the time to go through the proofs of various theorems, which I appreciated because most of them were unfamiliar to me before taking this class. He teaches well, and I think I learn better in my one hour in his lecture than in three hours with the textbook.
At the end of the semester he spent the last couple of lectures on complex variables.
He does have a Korean accent, but it is not thick enough to hurt his teaching. He makes an effort to learn the names of his students (and even recognized me outside of class and said hello), and cracks jokes every so often about his Korean-ness and about how mathematics is better than physics.
His tests are fair, bordering on easy for those who are mathematically gifted. There are no trick questions - it is just six questions, where usually one of them is multiple choice. I am not particularly strong in mathematics, but I have done well under his methodical teaching style.

Somedays he can be a good lecturer. He defines things like a mathematician would - clearly and precisely.
However, not everyone is a mathematician, and his definitions can sometimes get lost on me. Most of the time I found him to be reading off the slides, though he is quite helpful in explaining some portions of the course.
But he's pretty funny, and he has had more lectures that were good than those that were bad. One lecture was amazingly funny - he performed a card trick that will leave you bewildered, and offered bonus points to those who could solve it (hint: it used the principles taught in class).
I would take his class, but also be prepared to study from the textbook. I didn't find the textbook to be that bad, and the combination of textbook and Vovsha is more than enough to pass the course.

Take him, he's great.
He broke his hip this semester, and has been cracking jokes nonstop about morphine and his hip. He's hilarious.
He is also a clear lecturer, and I understood all of his chalkboard work. However, after he broke his hip he switched briefly to reading off the slides - which was not that helpful. The textbook presents all the material, so you can study from the textbook, but sometimes he does slip in some hints about the exams in lecture, so I would encourage you to attend the lectures before exams.
Three midterms - the last one is right before finals week, so be prepared for some cramming. The lowest equivalent is dropped (so either a midterm, or half the final if you bomb the final). The midterms are fair - they're usually short answer, and range from easy to difficult.

He seems like the man. Nope. I took this class as a sophomore with a good understanding of spanish already, thinking it would be a walk in the park...overall it was, but it was so incredibly frustrating.  The class itself is so dull and you will learn nothing on any given day. (if you're pretty good at spanish overall take this class, don't do anything during it and you'll get by fine, if you have no knowledge and want to actually learn something, find another teacher).
Oscar is super nice and you can tell he wants to be a cool dude that is fun etc - at times he is and its great - but at other times nothing is conveyed in a straightforward manner, nothing is organized he can be a little rough and confusing, did I mention nothing is organized? There is also a lot of work to be done for such little reward.  Homework twice a week online, about 4-6 exercises each with about 7-15 questions, some multiple choice, most written, 4- one paged compositions, a project, midterm and final, a few short quizzes.

Had failed the midterm, guaranteed failed the final and did fine on the paper and got like a B- or something just to fill the global core req.  If you want to learn don't take this, if you want to get by and fulfill a req this is your go to.

I had written a much longer and better review of Josh last semester, but somehow it got lost or maybe I just never hit submit. 
In any case, Josh is the professor you want for Music Hum. He is very understanding that many of us have no musical experience, and that many of us could not care less about meter or instrumentation before taking this class. With that in mind, he tries to make Music Hum entertaining and engaging for everyone without placing too much stress on us as students. He is more than clear in explaining everything, and will tell you when he is not too sure about something. When you come out of Music Hum, if anything, you will likely have an appreciation or greater appreciation for classical and even non-classical music. 
Even though it was his first semester teaching, the readings were very appropriate and the assignments were incredibly reasonable. Seriously, for quizzes and even the final, he prepared a study guide for us! That’s how much he wants you to learn. That being said, if you're a super music whiz who has been playing the piano or violin for years, you might find him boring, as he will likely explain things you know or can already pick up on. However, Josh is also very good about asking you about more specific questions (musical key, technique, etc) and then he builds off that for the rest of the class. 
There are unknown and known listenings, some listening assignments, the trip to the Met, essays, etc. like every Music Hum class. But all in all, if you’re looking for an engaging teacher who will make learning all this Music Hum stuff worth your time, Josh is the professor you want. 
If you manage to get him as your prof, don’t switch out! He is so worth it.

I'm not sure why she has a silver nugget. She is very nice but her class is not. I'm not the best Spanish speaker but picked it up well enough to get an ""A"" in Spanish 1 but got a ""C"" in her class despite putting forth much more effort. She will post assignments sometimes hours before class and expect them to be completed. The projects she assigns are extremely confusing and of very little benefit. More often then not she replaces actually teaching the material with just having the class do exercises for an hour.

Imagine if, on the first day of classes, Stefan from Saturday Night Live flounces into class and begins to lecture on New York's Hottest Club, The Box. Only Stefan isn't tame and just annoying, he's your professor who gives you grades, is blatantly rude to the students he doesn't like, and spends half of his lectures talking about himself. He puts together a banging syllabus, sure, but then spends his lectures talking about all of the different clubs he goes to as part of his research. At around halfway through the semester, he just seemed to stop caring and just started talking about his life. It's quite clear that he really cares more about his own work than he does about teaching.
He also does things that no professor should ever do, like read out the names of the students who received A+'s and A's on the midterm paper, and talks pretty openly about how some statements that students have made in class make him want to ""throw himself out of the window."" He's smart and sassy, sure, but he passed that point, and there were several students in the class (including me) who were scared to speak up because he shut us down so quickly.
Bottom line: if you're interested in the course material, show up and get the syllabus on the first day and then drop the class and do the readings on your own time. The readings are all amazing and interesting. Corona, however, isn't.

Seems like a nice person (she always brings us candy on exam days) but is by far the worst and most incompetent lecturer I've had during my time here. Frequently cancels office hours/problem sessions and this makes her inaccessible, it's impossible to get some 1-on-1 time with her, and she once didn't even show up to a session because she ""totally forgot."" During lecture she often forgets what she says, or backtracks and confuses the class (I'd actually prefer she read off the slide because then it'd be easier to follow). I also think it's pretty hypocritical of her to expect us to remember and regurgitate months' worth of information when she can't even get through a single lecture correctly WITH notes. She assigns problem sets due every two weeks that are a hassle to get through, and doesn't even grade them. I don't think she grades anything that gets handed to her in its entirety because I've definitely received exams where the grader's handwriting changes halfway. You'd think she would hand things back quicker if she had a bunch of Chem department drones doing her work for her.
I don't recommend taking biochem with her. Take it at Columbia instead.

Jeffrey was a fantastic teacher. This review will undoubtedly get some downvotes as I know of some people who disagree with me (and they are probably the most likely to come to review on CULPA), but I know of some others who agree with me on this as well.
I came into LitHum dreading it and thinking it would be the most painful class I’d take at Columbia. I end the class grateful that it was required and having learned more than I ever expected. This is largely a function of the incredible literature that we read, but is also reflective of Jeffrey’s teaching.
When I saw that Jeffrey was a Grad student (and in the History Department) I was pretty disappointed that my longest class wouldn’t be taught by an expert. But honestly, if anything his being a Grad student was a plus. He was never overbearing in his knowledge of the books or the historical context and was open to any ideas the students had, while still guiding the discussions in a way that helped you look at the books differently. This was especially important given that the amount of reading in LitHum was (at least for me) very overwhelming – I had to skip a lot of the readings and skim even more. While some of our discussions were less interesting than others (Medea basically devolved into a feminist dispute; we had a baffling conversation on the semantics of “power” vs. “authority” in King Lear, which I am convinced are effectively the same word; and an odd discussion of the effects of the Napoleonic War on Pride and Prejudice), the majority of the discussions were very interesting. We had some especially great discussions about Don Quixote, Crime and Punishment, and To the Lighthouse at the end of the year.
All said and done, Jeffrey was a very intelligent, fair, and attentive teacher, in addition to being the nicest guy in the world. He always listened to everyone’s opinion and guided the discussion skillfully without ever being condescending. He had an awesome tendency to respond to emails within minutes (always with his signature sign-off “Cheers”) and was readily available to meet, during or outside of Office Hours.
Tl;dr Jeffrey may not be a tenured professor but he has the exact qualities you want for a class like this. Taking this class made me more appreciative of the Core (barf, that’s something I thought I’d never say) and definitely of the literature.
Workload:
Participation – 20%. There are definitely too many readings but obviously this is not teacher-specific. Sparknotes is your friend. A couple reading quizzes first semester which didn’t factor into your grade much (thankfully, as I averaged a 60), but he dropped those second semester. Posts on the CourseWorks Discussion Board before each class; all you had to do was ask a question – this was by far the easiest part of the Participation grade as long as you remembered to do them. Word of advice: To do well in LitHum, you HAVE to force yourself to participate. Not only is participation worth a hefty part of your grade but it is also vital in giving your teacher a good impression, which will factor into other parts of your grade as well.
Papers – 40%. Three 5-page papers first semester with prompts, two 7-8 page papers second semester where you made your own prompt (these were much more interesting). All reasonably evaluated as far as I could tell.
Midterm – 15% first semester, 10% second semester when we also had to do a “Study Guide” for one of the readings, also worth 10%. Very reasonable midterm with Passage IDs that are much longer and easier than the final.
Final – 20%. Same final for (almost) all LitHum classes and is much more difficult to do without reading.

I doubt that this course will be offered again, though I should still write something here in case it is. 
Even though Prof Alarcón was a visiting professor here, I should write a review in case he comes back to visit or if you find this review and he's at another school. Rafael was a very knowledgeable professor able to answer all our questions and incorporate the latest research and information into our class. He works in migration studies at the Colegio de la frontera Norte in Tijauna, Mexico.  
The class was incredibly small (six students) so we all got to know each other and partake in small discussions from time to time. This class was honestly a joy, as a Mexican American it was great to be able to learn about the trends of Mexican migrants in the US and how they were treated or characterized. All in all, the course was straightforward and Prof Alarcón was a very reasonable professor. He would upload his PowerPoints and make himself available to discuss exams and the final paper. His lectures were a bit boring but he made up for it by being incredibly knowledgeable and open to answering any and every question. 
Though the course was mostly historical in nature, Prof Alarcón was more than interested in looking at the issue of Mexican migration through other lenses. We discussed issues of gender, race and sexuality and how they have changed, impacted and continue to impact Mexican migration. I also felt there was a large sociological aspect in the way we discussed social networks, monetary remittances, etc. In the end, I took in a variety of approaches to the question of Mexican migration and I wrote a research paper about a topic that was not so explored in migration studies, the issue of queer immigration (both historical and contemporary). The paper ended up being a mix between queer-studies and historical analysis, but he was more than happy to accept it. 
If Prof Alarcón does come back to Columbia or if you get the chance to take a class with him at another school, I would highly recommend it.

However, the class is about so much more than music.

TL;DR: Hsu is a solid professor if you're a math-y sort of person who wants derivation, proofs and (by CS standards) rigor. But if you want an easy ML survey course, go take AI, which is pretty much that.
The good:
Professor Hsu is by no means the most charismatic lecturer at Columbia, but he teaches a solid ML course. His lectures are thorough and rigorous -- he does not succumb to the temptation to use teaching a survey course as an excuse to skim easy topics at a high level -- and the online lecture notes are quite good. 
Also, it was really nice that the two textbooks the course uses are both available online for free, legally, and that he provided us links to them, unlike so many professors who assign the $300 latest edition of [insert textbook] without giving students' finances a second thought.
I was absolutely amazed how fast he responds to Piazza questions; he was single-handedly more responsive than a crew of about 8 TAs in another of my classes. The responses, always within a few hours, are sometimes not what the poster is hoping for (monosyllables aren't unusual: quite a few questions get a ""no."" and no more, particularly if they're stuff like extension requests), but the question is invariably answered in full. And that means stuff like ""what should we review for the final?"" gets answered with a 28-point bulleted list.
The bad:
No floating late days. There's a reason almost every CS class offers them, and it's both because they avoid all the whining on Piazza from people who put their work off to the last minute and because they provide a way to grant a bit of deadline flexibility without being unfair to anyone. Professor Hsu, if you read this, you really should consider having a few floating late days.
The first midterm was to a considerable degree just a speed test (caveat: I didn't feel that way; I mostly missed points for not being able to remember material. But everyone else I spoke to felt it was a speed test) and the curve was, by CS department standards, fairly tough.
The lecture hall (the huge one in NoCo) was dimly lit and has poor acoustics, which didn't make staying awake through lecture any easier given that Hsu isn't exactly lecturing at John McWhorter levels of energy most of the time.
Workload:
The homeworks (5 of them, max 5 hours apiece) weren't particularly hard, and there was a fair bit of hand-holding on them. Personally, I liked the hand-holding because it reinforces the material in a way that blindly guessing your way through a multi-step problem does not, but mileage may vary. Each homework had a programming component, to be done in MATLAB, but Hsu provided code to handle a lot of the tedious/extraneous stuff (e.g. rendering two images side by side); I found the programming to be a really effective introduction to MATLAB, which I'd never used before, and liked being able to focus only on the ML parts of programming.

If you’re looking at this review, it’s probably because you were placed into Professor Buonanno’s section. Lucky for you, Lorenzo is one of the best professors the core has to offer. He emphasizes visual analysis over rote memorization. Although participation is factored into your grade, he never forces students to speak and instead prefers natural discussion. He will entertain any question and will never mock a student’s interpretation of a work (no matter how ridiculous). Perhaps his best trait is his ability to keep the course material relevant--he incorporates pop culture references and contemporary issues into the discussion using his quirky sense of humor.

Perhaps the best thing about this course is Professor Jackson’s genuine love of the subject matter. He is passionate about the material yet maintains the tact and sensitivity necessary for a meaningful analysis of modern warfare. Professor Jackson claims that he cannot do the material justice and often incorporates outside sources to compensate. He supplements his lectures with film selections on an almost daily basis and, on several occasions, he brings in guest lecturers. 
There are sporadic reading assignments which are too long to be practical. As a non-history major, I didn’t have time to dedicate to over a hundred pages of overly-technical battle accounts. The written assignments are somewhat vague, which can adversely affect your grade if you don’t meet the TAs unclear expectations. The tests consist of short answer IDs and essay questions. Some of the IDs are really obscure names that were only discussed in a single lecture. This is probably the best reason for attending lecture regularly.

I have mixed feelings about this course. Firstly, there is the whole three professors thing. Ralph taught Monday lectures and then the class was split into three sections for Wednesday seminar. The professors rotated the sections as the semester progressed, so you got each one for several weeks. At first, I hated this chaotic organization but I came to appreciate the fact that, unlike most classes with discussion sections, the seminars weren’t in addition to the M/W periods.
The workload is fairly heavy and attendance is required. There are approximately 60-80 pages of reading a week and “reading response questions” due every Sunday night at 7PM. The majority of your grade, however, is determined by two short writing assignments and a term paper. The two writing assignments require off-campus visits on your own time (one to an exhibit at the MoMA; the other to the Seagram Building). The term paper is due progressively over the second half of the semester. The first draft represents the first half of your paper; the final draft represents your entire paper. Finally, you are twice required to co-lead the Wednesday seminar along with another student in your section. Each of you must present one of the readings for that week. 
Arguably the most annoying thing about this course is the due date for written assignments. Hard copies of all written assignments are due Friday mornings by 10AM on the fifth floor of the Diana Center. Submission deadlines at the end of the week take some adjusting to, not to mention that it’s difficult to drag yourself out of bed after staying up until 4 in the morning finishing said assignment. 
The course also entails two site visits, one to the Lower East Side (led by Todd) and one to New Haven (led by Ralph). Both excursions were incredibly informative and fairly well organized. My only complaint was the unfortunate weather conditions on both occasions. The Lower East Side visit was on a cloudy day in late February, so the cold was to be expected. The New Haven trip occurred in the middle of a late-winter snow storm. It is difficult to appreciate New Haven's architecture with snow blowing in your eyes.
The professors themselves each have their own quirks. Ralph is pretty straightforward, always attempting to present as much material as possible in lecture. He is amicable and genuinely interested in the material, wishing to instill this same interest in his students. Leah is a bit more abrasive and will not hesitate to correct you in seminar. That being said, she knows her stuff and truly cares about her students. Todd...well, Todd is Todd (do read his CULPA reviews). He is approachable, light-hearted, and just so sassy.  He always wears a smile and rarely speaks without even the slightest comical intent (dry humor to say the least).

The class was difficult to follow because of my weak foundation in Greek/Roman literature. However, he was a pleasant enough individual. He occasionally goes a little off topic and I think that discussions could be facilitated a little better, but he does do a good job at teaching the class. He's respectable and kind, for the most part. I didn't like the readings, but he did a good job at sparking interest in the texts by framing discussions with historical context at the beginning of some classes. He also has a strong personality---in a good way, and is brilliant. I would take another class with him, but he's apparently not teaching any classes but fye/fys classes? 9/10 reccomend.

Bad: Lectures too fast and reads from his textbook/readings word for word in class. Sometimes, he reads verbatim to the point where it's so difficult to follow what he is trying to convey because everything he says runs together. At that point, it becomes had to contextualize what he is saying and how it relates and my mind shuts off. I don't feel like I get as much as I could from the lectures; he should try to read less verbatim/from slides and make it more conversational. There were a lot of times in class where I've thought ""what is the main point?"" ""what am I susposta be learning?"" 
Good: The manner in which he facilitates class discussion allows for an interesting exchange of opinions(usually related to the reading). Trying to participate in class discussion usually involves some level of trying to form an intelligent and coherent thought, so for me personally I really felt the intellectual challenge from it. The readings are usually beneficial(except from that urban politics reader(sp?) book---which is terribly cumbersome in rhetoric). He also is a really nice person overall, and seems to go out of his way to converse with some of the students before class starts. It makes it seem like he actually cares about the students.

There are certain ways that she set the class up that I feel like could have been better---for example, the readings could have been more cohesive/tied together. Instead of doing three distinct phases of reading themes, I feel like they could have been interwoven, for example. 
She's very kind---although kind of aloof. My male professors show more emotion/affinity than she does. 
Many students look up to her and kind of idolize her, however once you get past the fact that she is literally brilliant in every sense, it's easy to see past that. I feel like I would look up to her if I was able to actually relate to her in some way as a person---I wanted to identify with her but I couldn't. 
Seemed brusque during office hours. Very good lecturer though. Very good communication skills. Good readings. Enthusiastic. I feel like she would be better at teaching upper-div courses. 8.2/10 overall.

These reviews really do give a great representation of Tina, and it's easy to see why.  The fact is, great professors are often polarizing, and Tina is no exception.
She has an effective teaching style, with an approachable personality conveying a dense amount of information that is made easy to understand if you put in the effort. If you come to her class with an open mind, you will learn a ton. She is a tough grader on papers, but she gives good criticisms and guidance for how to rewrite your paper for a higher grade and just expects you to write well-thought arguments. She includes readings for every class, which greatly enhance the class and while not strictly necessary, if you don't do them you'll miss out on a lot of what's going on and only superficially understand the lectures.
As these reviews show, if you're like 95% of students, you'll love her. She is accessible during office hours, and still takes time to help former students long after they've taken the class (especially if you go on to more Art History), which is why so many of us think highly of her.
Unfortunately, if you have the stubborn arrogance to suggest that you know more about a subject matter than the professor (while simultaneously not being able to appreciate the depth of her arguments and differentiate them from wikipedia), if you are the type of humorless misanthrope to become enraged by the fact that your professor has a personality, and if you have a frail ego that cannot accept having your superficial, elementary opinions questioned and corrected, then you will no doubt have that illusion shattered by a professor like Tina, who refuses to feed your delusions.  
If you're that guy, you should probably avoid her class and just read wikipedia instead. Otherwise, you'll end up here a year later, still nursing a grudge that she didn't give you the A that you didn't earn (but you still felt entitled to), and trying to exact your revenge by impotently lashing out in multiple negative reviews, failing to understand why most people actually love her class and unable to just let it go and move on.
For the rest of us--healthy, well-balanced students who just want to learn from someone who knows their stuff and isn't boring--you will be glad you took Tina's class.  If she does ever teach Art Hum again in the future, I can't recommend her highly enough. At the risk of repeating others, she's pretty awesome.

I don’t understand how Dr. M still doesn’t have at least a silver nugget. She is a fantastic lecturer and when you are sitting in her class, you can easily tell that she is well-seasoned in teaching and talks with ease. She gets the material across very clearly, and as long as you do the problems honestly, you should be able to do fairly well in the class. Yes, introductory biology may be more stressful than it needs to be because of the exams, but that does not mean Dr. M is a bad lecturer. In fact, she is one of the best I’ve had at Columbia.

This was definitely one of the more rewarding classes I took over my time at Columbia. To put it in succinct words, at the end of the last lecture prof. Neuhouser got a standing ovation, and he deserved it. 
In terms of the class structure itself it was a really good mix of lecture and discussion. Neuhouser knows the material so well that he can really engage with students when they ask questions and often understands what the student is saying even when he/she doesnt fully know what they dont get. He is pretty smart in applying the concepts to thought experiments and real world scenarios, even ones that students come up with on the fly and this gives one a more intuitive sense of the material that can be pretty complex and abstract. He really is a great lecturer in this sense and going to class was always interesting and rewarding.  
However, one criticism I have that it is difficult to disagree with him in class. He seems pretty convinced of his ideas and that Marx is right (he has a set of hammer and sickle cuff-links that he wears to class) about a lot of things and engaging him with other models of economic thought or bringing in ideas not classically within the realm of the material he covers usually meets with being quickly dismissed. The students in the class as well tend to be of the communist/activist variety and there is an unspoken agreement in the class that modern economic means of production and 21st century capitalism is evil. In this sense the class can be a little ideological, so if you're the type to get offended by that you should avoid it. As someone who generally disagrees with that line of ideology, myself I found that this class really helped me develop a more nuanced view of social issues through this lens and even led me to change some of my beliefs. So if you are thinking of taking it as a fun class or as an elective outside your major or have found yourself curious to delve into Marx and Hegels views on the world and social theory, this is a pretty great class. Its rigorous enough to be satisfying and accessible enough to allow you to participate effectively.
In terms of grading, I do not know why people are upset. As someone who had not read most of the stuff before and as an engineer I did pretty well in the class with the usual amount of effort. I didnt have to try super hard or struggle or anything. Doing the readings and spending maybe 10 hours on each paper is good enough to get you an A-. Although people well versed in philosophy were the ones that probably got A's.
He says he has a strict grading policy and gives average work a C, good work a B and excellent work an A. But if you write a paper that makes sense you will definitely get at least a B+.
Neuhouser himself is a great guy, very approachable, and will always engage with you whether your question is basic or well-informed.

RJ was the saving grace in this class. Whereas Professor Corona was rude, frequently absent, and useless for advice, RJ was kind and more than willing to sit with you for an hour and discuss your paper and your life. I talked to Corona once for my paper and after that, all contact I had was with RJ because he was just so much better. He gives you suggestions, helps you work through difficult issues, and is all-around a great guy. He knows something about almost every topic you can think of and will be able to direct you to resources to improve your work. He also always smiles which is great in a classroom as toxic as Corona's.

I think Maybe the previous reviewer's comment that Judt's book is the only redeeming part is perhaps strong, but the lectures were pretty dry.

Unlike the previous reviewer I rather enjoyed this class. every two sessions was devoted to another play: measure to measure, troilus and cressida, king lear, antony and cleopatra, the tempest, etc. I thought her lectures were generally good although she seemed to enjoy explaining shakespeare's references to human sexual behavior the most.

The Power Point images need to correlate with the ideas presented in lecture. 20th century art is very conceptual and theoretical, but I would appreciated lectures that were more directly linked with artworks. We moved at such a rapid pace that we were unable to really focus on any movement.  
Ironically, Alberro is much like the enigmatic artist Jeff Koons. You can never tell if he is being tongue-in-cheek about artwork that was often made to mock its audience. This is strangely appealing, because he seems to mirror the artists at hand. I wish that he spent more time acknowledging the widespread criticism of 20th century work for ""not being art."" 
Spell Check is not a fan of this class. Alberro makes up his own words, such as ""spectacularist"" and ""anthropomorphical."" One of his favorite words is ""phenomenological."" He could condense his longwinded lectures by speaking more straightforwardly.   
Nearly every person in this class was on Facebook, e-mail and other social media websites during lecture. It would be helpful if Alberro banned laptops from the class, because they are extremely distracting. However, it is difficult to pick out the key points in Alberro's lectures. People usually end up typing the lectures verbatim. 
As an aside, this was the most well-dressed group of students I've ever seen. Be warned that no one wears sweatshirts and jeans to the midterm. Chanel minimalist clothing is a more fitting choice.

O'Keeffe's class is a usually a one-man show, but no one seems to mind. Sometimes I wish that he would make more of an effort to stimulate class participation and listen to our ideas. My confidence in speaking French did not improve. Oral skills are targeted in Composition and Conversation, which I will take next semester. 
I valued O'Keeffe's passion for the French language, literature, art and history. He sparked my curiosity about linguistics, since he'd tell us about how words were formed. For example, the word ""mayday"" in English evolved from the French ""m'aidez"" or ""help me."" 
Writing about artworks in French vastly improved my writing skills as an art history major. It is helpful to copy the model of O'Keeffe's sample essays, handed out in class, because they are very straightforwardly and poetically. 
O'Keeffe is obsessed with literature and fables. Many of the paragraphs that we completed in class (by inserting the correct verb conjugations) were excerpted from Baudelaire, Baudrillard and other French authors. This made the usual painfully boring grammar exercises more fun and engaging.

I valued Stokes' accessibility as a professor. It is easy to ask questions in class or approach her after lecture. After hearing anecdotes about her husband Ronny, suburban upbringing, adverting career, and vacations to exotic locales, I feel that I know her as a person. I do wish that she would eliminate irrelevant anecdotes, and just tell ones that pertain to psychology. 
Throughout the course, I craved more information. I know that this is an introductory class, but I felt that we barely skimmed over the brain and other critical topics. As Columbia students, we are intelligent enough to handle a more rigorous and in-depth curriculum. 
Whenever Stokes was asked about the neurochemistry that drives behavior, she would stumble and have to look at her notes. She is most knowledgable about problem-solving and presented a fascinating powerpoint about the psychology of Monet's creativity. The math program that she created for elementary-school students is also impressive. 
Stokes is clearly a visual learner, and often would present information in schematic diagrams. It was difficult for me to digest concepts in this way, since the connections between ideas (drawn with arrows, lines etc.) were vague and confusing.

My friends complained of Professor Bodart's French accent, because it was sometimes difficult to understand. However, I found myself entranced by Bodart's intelligence, subtlety and eloquence. She has an immense amount of knowledge about Spanish Baroque history. Her love for the subject matter shines through her lectures. 
Spanish Baroque art is purely fascinating. My mind was blown when we learned about how polychrome sculpture functioned in processions. In order to create a more visceral, physical religious experience, Baroque art pushed the boundaries of the ""real."" We also learned about portraits that were used as a political tool, to spread idealized images of the Hapsburg kings. This is still relevant today, as politicians cultivate images of themselves. My lovely TA, Ray Carlson, discussed Chuck Close's tapestry of Obama in Britain's U.S. embassy in relation to ""body politic.""

Prof. Malkin is the best. Not only does she understand and explain the material very thoroughly, she also makes a genuine effort to learn her students' names and engage the class. She has this one-liner which she uses when nobody raises their hand: 
""You either do not understand and should ask a question, or you understand and can give me the answer."" - Prof Malkin's honesty/authenticity shows through in one-liners like this one. 
Lecturing style - probably one of the best lecturers in the department. She does this thing where she gives a hand-waving, intuitive explanation of something, and then shows it formally. 
She is extremely approachable and very open about how grading is done in the class. Prof. Malkin and her TAs put in an try very hard to make the course fair, always retroactively applying a policy change to all students if one student brings it up, and I think that this attitude starts at the top with Prof. Malkin setting the example.

Prof Rubenstein is clearly very smart - it shows because he makes really good slides that explain things well. But every lecture, he gets onto the stage and fumbles for 75 minutes. It is frustrating for students who do not come in with a lot of knowledge about computer organization, because he appears unprepared. 
There were quite a few times where I skipped the lecture because it was more helpful to spend the time studying the slides on my own. Ended up doing just fine on the homework and exams.
It's not as bad of a class as everyone says - just that if you come in w/ less knowledge, you have to put in the work to make up for that gap (and Rubenstein isn't helpful for that). Talking to the TAs makes a big difference because many are knowledgeable and good at explaining stuff.

This class started out very well - Prof. Olvera-Cravioto explained things very clearly, providing both intuitive and formal explanations. I think she probably went too slowly - do we need to spend more than 30 minutes reviewing how double integrals work?
Then, there was a period of 2 weeks that she was gone at some conference, and two TAs filled in for her. The first TA was fine but the 2nd went way too fast and didn't explain things well.

This was a great class! Samuel is a great professor who always made class interesting and lively.  Very talkative, funny, and honestly just adorable.  He always provided creative and fun topics of discussion or exercises to do in class as a way of practicing whatever it is you're learning -- which forces you to learn it because you're using it in conversation but also helps students understand how to practically use the grammar rules in real conversation.  My only vice is that we didn't get back graded work in a timely manner at all -- it's the end of the semester and I only know my grade for one test and two compositions.

A really engaging lecturer, absolutely hilarious commentary on the texts you're reading, and so very knowledgeable about the field in general.  This course is great -- a lot of really interesting texts (Beowulf, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, some Canterbury Tales, etc.) and even if you've already read some of these Professor Johnson will absolutely teach you something new and provide really insightful and interesting information.  The syllabus also includes poems you've almost definitely not read previously, but they're great and Professor Johnson obviously loves them and will make you love them as well.  The lectures are so organized and easy to follow -- she will basically walk you through the poem from start to finish and make sure everyone understands what's going on (which is sometimes difficult, especially with the texts read in Middle English).  She also makes sure to take time to pause at various points throughout the lecture and take any questions students might have, which is great because it adds a slight discussion aspect to the course.

Beware of this class.  I'm not going to say take it or don't -- just know that this section is not for everyone.  The class is basically a debate class, so if you like that sort of thing then this is the CC section for you.  If you prefer a class where you will learn about the themes and complexities of the texts (which, in my opinion, is the point of CC) take someone else.  The basic setup of this class is this: every class period, students are required to come prepared to speak about a short passage (like 1-3 lines) and pose an opinion on that passage, at which point the class becomes a discussion over the various opinions about that passage.  Alex doesn't seem to prepare for class at all because, honestly, he doesn't need to since the entire discussion is dictated by the passages students pick and the opinions formed about them.  The workload is very different from most other sections with the blog posts and C3 experiment (explained below), but neither the syllabus nor Alex himself were ever very clear about requirements, so there was a lot of student discussion outside of class just trying to figure out what was required from us to get a good grade, which was insanely frustrating.  I felt like this class was a waste of my 2 hours 2x/wk, but I know there were students in the class that really enjoyed it so maybe it's just me.  Just know that this is not a traditional CC class in that you will not even attempt to unpack what the text is saying -- you will only talk about very little snippets at a time.

There's always a lot of flipping back in forth in really large texts and it's easy to get lost.  She'll also cite a page number and then immediately start reading from some undisclosed and random point on the page, so by the time you figure out where she's reading from she's already moved on to commentary and you've missed half of what she said.

Professor Bauer was a really nice guy and very approachable and helpful one-on-one but he failed to command the attention of the class. It was a bit hard to understand/hear him when he taught and his class was severely boring. That being said, if you take the time to attend his office hours he is very patient and will sit with you and explain things you don't understand. The homeworks he assigned were much harder than he realized and took several hours to complete- often dealing with little Java technicalities such as generics which were usually much more involved than Bauer taught in class. Additionally, the textbook for this class absolutely sucks but for the most part Bauer's slides were helpful.

DO NOT take this course if: 
1. You are not interested in either art or history. The class contains both in-depth discussions on artists and their artwork, and lengthy readings about the history of Spain. The readings are assigned in each class, and the Professor expects students to make outlines on them (though she doesn't usually check if you have). She hands out sheets in class with questions and students are expected to be able to regurgitate information learned in the (way above vocabulary level, especially if you are not a native speaker or have not spoken Spanish in a while) readings. This was definitely the wrong choice for me, a person for whom the only thing worse than history is art history. 
2. You have not spoken Spanish in a while. I had not spoken Spanish regularly for over 6 months prior to taking the class, and had forgotten a lot of my grammatical and vocabulary skills. The Professor is not forgiving about this at all, and on top of not allowing any English in the classroom (expected for a 3300 level class, so this isn't really a problem), she refuses to review vocabulary or grammar and gives major side-eye when asked to provide a word if a student has simply forgotten it. Additionally, at the beginning of the class, she makes explicit that she will not teach grammar; students are expected to do additional work outside of class if they wish to learn about grammar, as if we are not already taking four or five other classes at an Ivy League University. 
3. You don't like to speak in class. The Professor expects students to speak up and speak often; speaking once or twice every couple of classes definitely doesn't cut it. She expects students to speak at least once during every class, so do that. She also requires that students do multiple oral presentations throughout the semester. 
4. You enjoy clear due dates and organization. The Professor does an extremely poor job of clarifying due dates for each essay, and does not warn students when they are coming up either via CourseWorks or in class. She expects students to be constantly checking the syllabus, which she often does not follow anyway. 
5. You like to cite other sources in your research papers. She has very high expectations for student analysis and learning in the class, and does not like to see students citing frequently in their papers. 
Pros: she is very understanding if you need to turn something in late, and makes herself available and keeps in touch. 
Cons: (other than what was stated above) she can develop a grudge against a particular student if she feels that he/she is not performing satisfactorily

Don't believe the silver nugget for a second. She's a bad teacher, and it's a bad class. It might be better than the other econometrics classes, so you might still be better off taking it with her, but don't get your hopes up. She's a boring teacher, and the class is very poorly run. There were frequent mistakes in her problem set solutions, test solutions, and final review slides, to the point where we were having to guess which of the two contradictory things she had told us was right. The material is boring and frustrating as is, but the way her class is run made it much worse. Nobody I know who went to class ever managed to stay awake, and her half-assed attempts at being funny just make it that much more painful for everybody who tried to pay attention. She's worthless as a lecturer, and you're guaranteed to feel at some point as if you've been wronged by the way she does things. If there are other options to take this class with, do that.

Chris can't teach for his life. Yes, the course was pretty easy. Yes, the exams were very much like the review sheet, but I can't really say that I learned statistics in the process. Chris stops regularly to ask if people have questions and encourages student participation, but he always seems exasperated. On the first day of class, he said to us: ""when you raise your hand and ask a question or make a comment, make sure to tell me your name so I can judge you when you say something stupid."" 
I have a pretty strong math background - I've done well in both Calculus and Chemistry thus far in college. But, for some reason, it is very difficult to understand the material when Chris lectures. I think the problem is that he doesn't provide an overview or even say what topic we're covering, he'll just write some numbers on the board and forget to say which test statistic it is, what formula we're using, what assumptions we're making, and the general purpose of the test.
If you have to take statistics, I'd choose a professor who uses a powerpoint. At least the lectures would be somewhat standardized...If you're a Barnard student, take psych stats for goodness sakes. I thought regular stats would be fine, but it's honestly just been a hassle...

Professor Stroessner is a great lecturer! He provides interesting examples related to education policy, the legal system, and discrimination (his area of research), which makes class fun and engaging. 
There are four exams during the course of the semester, none of which are cumulative. He requires you to read the textbook, but I looked up the terms at the end of each chapter an hour before each exam and it's worked out very well. On the first day of the class, he will say he doesn't curve - but it's not actually true. He curves at the end of the course, not each individual exam. 
Highly recommend!

Worst class I have ever taken. Dabashi clearly has some kind of big-shot rep, but this class was no evidence for why. I have seen Facebook posts from him that show more effort than this entire class. This class was pain, and everyone spent the entire thing on Facebook
He arrives with no notes whatsoever, says 'What are we doing today?' and riffs on a couple sentences unhelpfully for the rest of the class. There is no structure or substance. The syllabus was a hilariously ambitious list of history books, films, poetry collections, books and blogs - none of it organized by date or session, in no particular order, and with no excerpts, just whole works. Some of this impossibly large collection of assignments was at Book Culture - I bought the books; we ended up never reading them. We were, however, apparently meant to read things that were out of print, unavailable from Butler, or from Book Culture, or anywhere in New York. Dabashi would say things like 'Isn't it all on the internet? You'll find it.' At any rate, that didn't really matter, because the class's absurd 'presentation' format meant we were never accountable for doing the reading anyway. 
The class was entitled 'Film, Fiction, Poetry, History'. We spent about half the class on history and about half on film - or rather, on Dabashi's book about film, with no watching of the actual films, apparently. Fiction was barely skimmed over, poetry just did not happen, and the 'blog'/internet section we were meant to get to at the end obviously did not happen either. I was taking the class for fiction and poetry, which we just didn't do. On the second to last session, Dabashi expressed surprise at the date, and tried to get through about half the syllabus in the last class.
If I were convinced about a kernel of this man's supposed massive genius and well of knowledge it might have been OK, but he actually seemed to know nothing whatsoever and have the least sophisticated thought process of any prof or TA I've ever had.
The midterm paper was never graded, so the class has ended and I have no idea how I'm doing.
The sum of what Dabashi actually said during the class would probably fit on two sides of paper. He has 2 or 3 spiels that he trundles out, more or less verbatim, now and then, in extensive monologue, apparently without remembering that he has already said them. (Once, we spent about 20 minutes discussing a film scene and watched it in class; several sessions later, Dabashi brought up the scene apparently thinking it was entirely new to us, introduced it, and summarized the whole thing to make the same point.) These spiels can be found in his books, which he assigns. Neither sheds any light on the other, it's just more repetition. On the rare occasion that Dabashi manages to elicit a comment from a student, he tends to misunderstand it. His response is usually patronizing, and tends to consist of side-eyeing your supposedly problematic phraseology before launching in to rant A, B, or C, as outlined in one of his books.

Horrible, horrible class. As an African I was incredibly ecstatic to see an Art history course focused on African art on the course directory, but little did I know I had signed up for an awful, boring, at times offensive anthropology class, with a Professor that is not at all hands on with students, doesn't communicate, doesn't seem to give a damn about her students at all. I didn't ever want to show up to class after the first 2 and when I did just rolled my eyes at the ridiculousness of some of the cultural ""facts"" that were supposed to have somehow informed West African art (coming from a West African). The grading is hard and expects you to know minuscule details about every artwork (which is probably normal for any art history class) but is pretty ridiculous considering you are learning mostly about outdated cultural beliefs, not the works themselves 75% of the semester. If you are not required to, do not take this class. And if you already have, please do not let it shape your perceptions of Africa.

Professor Mehta and I got along like oil and water. Shade was thrown 24/7, and I think there was a mutual dislike of each other, which you could tell even whilst in class, where she would subtly try to make all of my arguments fall through, and always look shocked when I said something that could be construed as smart. She also is very easily side-tracked, and picks favorites.
I came into the class not quite knowing what to expect, but I'd heard good things about her. We had much more work than other seminar classes, and it was treated more like a first-year English class than a seminar. Each paper had its own spin on it; one time we had to give a speech to the class, one time we had to do a creative writing, etc. 
You don't really need to read the books to keep up in the class, and most of the class is discussion. This is, however, a pretty work intensive course, with a great deal of readings as well as writings. However much we did not get along, I will admit that my writing did improve in her class. I felt my writing tighten and was much less wishy-washy. which is funny, because she always gave me poor grades on my assignments because she felt I was ""too concise"". She very much likes students who are prolix and are deeply interested in subject matters that come up in her class. Otherwise, she won't really be fond of you. Mehta is very good with drafts, and she always meets with students one-on-one to help them out, and responds in decent time to emailed drafts for more input. Her grading is generally quite fair.

Hands down, my favorite course of the semester. Professor Wennerlind knows exactly what he's talking about, and it is truly enjoyable to listen to him lecture. I'd come in even when I was sick, purely because I wouldn't want to miss out. He gave me a lot of insight into Trans-Atlantic relations and I really came away feeling like I had learned something and that it would stick with me.
The first half of the semester was an overview of the time period and the set-up for each of the different groups, the merchants, the pirates, and the slaves. It gave context to all the countries involved, from political to economic to religious reasons. The second half of the semester focused on these different groups of people. The most time was spent on the merchants, than a bit less on the slaves, then the least on the pirates. Professor Wennerlind tended to repeat himself a lot, but I think that was merely for emphasis rather than filling up time. 
There was a heavy workload, with perhaps a hundred pages due per class, but it was a lecture style class, so while doing the readings enriched the lecture, they weren't necessary for your survival in class. There was very little class participation, though Professor Wennerlind would encourage it sometimes, and was very good at answering questions to the best of his ability. There were also three short essays, and one final essay, along with an in-class midterm and final. My only qualm with him is that while we were a class of around thirty students, he never bothered to learn anybody's name. 
Overall, I would definitely recommend this class, even to someone who did not have that much background in history.

I came into this class with a lot of doubts. I was taking it to fulfill my quantitative requirement at Barnard, and was very worried about the amount of mathematics and physics was going to be in the class. To my relief, there was barely any of either, and I absolutely adored the class.
Professor Agueros knows exactly what he is talking about, and his lectures are interesting and engaging. He encourages questions and comments, and always replies to the best of his ability. He also makes people write questions on slips of paper before they leave class everyday, and starts the following class by reviewing the previous lecture and answering some of the questions he got. 
Professor Agueros is very approachable and happy to help, and just wants his students to come away from the class with a basic knowledge of astronomy. He grades harshly but fairly, and arranges for some cool lessons (such as a visit to the rare manuscripts portion of Butler to see first editions of Galileo, Copernicus, and Newton). The work load is not that bad, with seven homework assignments over the course of the semester, and a midterm as well as a final.
I would recommend this class to people who are bad at math and trying to fulfill their quantitative requirement, as well as anybody who was every interested in the solar system when they were kids. I very much enjoyed myself.

This class was a major disappointment. I had read such great reviews of the class, and to be completely honest, was intrigued with not taking a midterm or a final. Big mistake. The readings at the beginning of the semester were interesting, but about a month in they got very boring. The essays became a struggle to write, and the class is curved so much a 70% is a B+. It's ridiculous. 
Professor Khan himself I did not find particularly compelling. There were certain days where he would have some interesting points about sociology and society. Other days, he was incredibly boring, and I was reduced to bringing a sudoku book to class to fend off boredom. Some of his lectures I found did not even pertain to the readings we were doing, and focused more on philosophers than on applied concepts. He also has an electronics policy, where if someone is caught on the internet or with a phone up to three times, the class is then banned from technology use. 
I would not really recommend this class to anyone, except people who are very interested in sociology and don't want to take midterms or finals.

I can't figure out how I feel about this class. On the one hand, I learned a lot of certain wars, as well as strategic maneuvers, which is why I wanted to take the class. On the other hand, Professor Jackson frequently gave out irrelevant or incorrect facts, had not very useful power points, was easily led on a tangent, and had virtually pointless readings. 
However, you could tell that Professor Jackson truly was interested in the subject matter, which is a plus, so for some battles he would be able to give a very good in-depth analysis of what happened. I came out of the class with a stronger knowledge of military history, and an interest to take more history classes of the sort. 
The class was often divided up in the first forty five minutes was Professor Jackson lecturing, and the latter half was watching a movie clip. It was a very easy class work-wise, and there was little class participation. When there was, the question was generally not fully resolved, and a comment was generally waved away.

The below reviews are, quite frankly, ridiculous, and clearly written by students who didn't put any effort into the class. I think we can all acknowledge that Intro Psych Lab is not the most enthralling course that Barnard has to offer. All the same, it teaches the fundamentals of lab work in psychology, a skill which an alarming amount of people simply don't have upon entering college and are in desperate need of learning. 
Professor Light is, simply put, a brilliant professor. His specialties are in behavioral neuroscience and intelligence. Have a one-on-one conversation with him (that is, if you're not the typical ""I'm only taking this to fulfill the requirement"" students who probably doesn't give a damn and shouldn't be allowed in the already scarce psych labs, anyway) about his research and you'll be floored by his knowledge and inspired to take more upper-level psych courses. I've heard great things about his Learning Lab, and would encourage anyone who wants a hands on experience to try it. He does a damn good job of trying to make required material as interesting as possible-- a nearly impossible task, which Light does with humor, wit, and the occasional 80's or early 90's theme song. 
The workload is reasonable and entirely manageable, and Professor Light is incredibly approachable and a very funny, interesting guy if you actually take the time to get to know him. Unlike many Columbia and Barnard professors, Light cares about what you have to say, is incredibly available to help with assignments and explain material, understands that his is not the only course you're taking, and sets reasonable requirements and goals for coursework. Showing even a modicum of intelligence and effort (increasingly a rarity at this school, I'm sorry to say) will set you on the right track to success. Put in the time and effort and you will see the results (as all courses should be).
I couldn't recommend Professor Light any higher.

Professor Cooley is an extremely laidback guy, and you can tell he knows what he's talking about. He's done his research. He's fascinated in the material. And he's an interesting lecturer too. I went to class often during the first half of the class, but then workload from other classes got too heavy so I missed a lot the second half. Going to class isn't *necessary* to do well at all, but I do generally find the class interesting. Sometimes, though, I thought he focused too much on global regions that I'm not fascinated in (mostly Middle Eastern countries). That said, I did learn more about it because he brought it up a lot.
Workload: not bad. There's a lot of reading, but I did most of it while writing the papers. There are 3 papers--one short one (4-5 pages), one long one (10 pages), and a take home final (2 prompts, 4 pages each). They're pretty straightforward and you only need the readings as sources. And if you actually do your readings, it should be fine. Even not doing the readings (like me), you can read what you need and write the paper. I usually wrote them pretty last minute, but still managed to pull decent grades, which leads me to my next point: it seems like a pretty easily graded class. There are a lot of grad students, so I think they're a little easier on undergrads.
Overall: not a bad course at all. Not necessarily the most interesting, but still relatively interesting with a pretty awesome professor.

Dr. Deopurkar is the best professor I have had at Columbia (1 year). Dr. Deopurkar has the uncommon ability to take a seemingly abstract and/or complex idea and break it down into steps that are understandable. The pace of the class is slow so if you are passingly familiar with calculus you will do fine. 
Most importantly, there is a high correlation between what is taught in the class and what is on the exams. There are no curveballs. He will definitely ask you the most challenging version of a concept SOMETIMES (IE, a more difficult limit vs. an easier one) but it is all stuff that was either on the homework or covered in class. By the time that the test comes, if you can do the homework and get them all correct without having to get help, then you can get a 100% on the exam. Quite doable. Other professors in other departments don't have as high of a correlation between material on the exam and material covered in class. Just want to stress again that he didn't have any curveballs; this alone makes his class worth taking because you know what to expect. He puts out multiple practice midterms and finals for each test so there is no shortage of material to practice with. 
On a downside, he seems fairly busy and doesn't seem to make a whole lot of time for students, as far as I can tell. I never really sought out his help but I know that other students have had a hard time getting a hold of him. However, the math help room can answer any questions you need answered so honestly I don't think this is that big of a deal, unless you're just trying to get face time with him or something.
The average for midterm 1 was 68% +/- 18% and the second midterm was very similar, I think 70% +/- 18%. Don't know about the final yet. 
I would take him for any class I needed. I am sure that his teaching and class administration style carry over from subject to subject.

Professor Huber is a kind man.  Friendly and approachable.  His TAs are a bit arrogant but helpful.  HOWEVER, the disorganization and inability to maintain consistency cripple his effectiveness. This crippling was noted by Professor Huber a few times, stating that the results of quizzes and assignments are how he knows he has failed as an instructor.  We started with being told we would have up to 12, two of which would drop(15%).  We had 7.  We were told we would have 6 assignments, we had 5, last one due the final day of class and an optional 6th due during reading week(40%).  The first 4 favored heavily the knowledge of Stata, not statistics. A midterm(20%) and a final (25%).  The final was held the last day of class, regardless of heavy end of semester work loads.  The final was extremely complex and like the quizzes was loaded with trick questions.  That would not be an issue if early in the semester Huber and TAs had not explicitly and repeatedly expressed their intention not to trick students and to be looking for what you know, not what you don't.  During the quizzes it was common place for the professor to admit multiple answers were correct, or that the question itself was poorly written or wrong all together.  During the second to last week of class we were informed that that structure of the grading was going to change, still unclear of exactly how that went.  The professor explicitly said, in the beginning of the semester, that there is no required reading, but if for some reason you do not understand the lecture the readings were supplemental.  He did so in a way that implied that if you needed the readings, you were not paying attention.  NONE of that is true.  Many students resorted to purchasing textbooks as an attempt to understand what he was teaching.  If you find yourself in this class, form a group IMMEDIATELY, do ALL the readings, seek out a tutor or additional resources and keep personal record of quiz answers, returned assignments and midterms.  Compare all answers and grading with others in your group to ensure fair and accurate grading.  This class required heavy student monitoring of all aspects of grading.  If you are not working in a group, or posses a strong statistics background, it will be extremely difficult to succeed in this course.  That being said, for my class, a 75% on assignments and quizzes was great (At one point the professor stated that when 42% of the class got a question right, the class was doing ""Great"").

This is the single best class I've taken thus far in my college career! The first day of the course, Professor Autesserre will tell everyone that the class is very challenging, so those who are not ready should drop the course immediately so other students can sign up. She has the very best interests of her students in mind, but I don't think the course is too challenging at all. In fact, the amount of reading was manageable, the take-home exams do-able, and overall the material was easily understood and INTERESTING! That doesn't mean the material wasn't challenging to a certain extent, but it made the class all the more engaging. 
Professor Autesserre is also a fantastic lecturer! Each class is jam-packed with information and super engaging - I only missed one lecture during the entire semester (for an interview). Note that they do take attendance every class though, and in every discussion section.
During the first half of the semester, Professor Autesserre presents different theoretical models for understanding civil war - colonialism, economic opportunity, etc... Then, during the second half of the semester, she covers humanitarian aid, peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding. Each lecture, she also describes cases of civil wars in a few countries that exemplify these models. At the end of class, she asks students to share the strengths and weaknesses of each model, and then she shares her own perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses. 
This structure is fantastic because it's EXACTLY what you're expected to do on the take-home exams. At the beginning of the semester, I didn't really understand what constituted a strength/weakness, but by the end of the semester I knew exactly how to perform this type of critique. The take-home exams do require a bit of outside research, but she provides an entire list of sources and you don't need anything more than that. Essentially class lectures and readings help frame your argument, and research just provides case details of civil wars in the country you're analyzing. 
Discussion section was also great! Professor Autesserre expects the TAs to help students understand the readings during section, and then we would have a discussion about a larger question like how much aid countries like the U.S. are morally obligated to send to countries experiencing civil war. 
You will not regret taking this class!

This class was a bit disappointing. The premise is great - studying late 19th/early 20th century immigration in New York City and comparing it to current immigration patterns/issues. Unfortunately, Professor Kobrin typically teaches seminars, and this class - her first lecture course - wasn't great. I am already very interested in the topic, but the lectures didn't quite meet expectations - they just didn't feel very in-depth or rigorous. Professor Kobrin kept saying ""next week we'll explore xyz,"" but we just never seemed to get there. The best lectures though were presented by Jessica, the teaching fellow, who is fantastic! I felt that she covered more material within the class period, but still provided more insights into the greater theme for each week (i.e. race, gender, cross-neighborhood interactions) than Professor Kobrin. If you're a self-directed learner who will be satisfied with interesting readings, then this may be the class for you. Otherwise, I'd wait until Professor Kobrin teaches it again as a seminar (or until Jessica teaches a course!).
The best aspect of the class, however, was the mandatory volunteer component. Immigrant New York was supposedly Columbia's first service-learning lecture course, and overall that part was a great experience. We volunteered 2-4 hours per month at the Riverside Language Program as conversation partners for students in their English classes (immigrants living in NYC who have been here for less than 2 years). RLP, as we called it, is a fantastic organization and volunteering there seemed like a great way to learn about (and interact with) some of the most current issues that the city is facing (for example, how to provide language learning services to the huge population of newly arrived immigrants; how to make healthcare and education resources available to residents who don't speak English).

Although she gave students the chance to engage in dialogue about the text, which was helpful and insightful, she also made the students engage in an unbearably infantile exercise in which students would form groups and answer a set of easy and uninteresting questions. This kind of exercise really belongs in middle school, not in college. This infantilizing attitude pervaded her entire interaction with students; she was more interested in proving her competence than in teaching.
In addition, her feedback on papers was incredibly subpar. This has nothing to do with the grading, by the way, which I thought was entirely fair. But she never offered any ground or reason for her comments. She would just write ""irrelevant,"" ""not detailed enough,"" which hardly explains or even describes the irrelevance or lack of detail of a passage. Otherwise her comments would be themselves petty and irrelevance, such as claiming there is a strict rule for when to use commas instead of dashes, which is false -- and if it weren't, I'm sure there were a hundred things more interesting and important for her to tell me than that.

Miguel is a wonderful art professor. He is patient, personable, and kind-hearted. For example, he adopts stray cats and allows them to live in his studio. Enough said. He cares about every one of his students, and is invested in our improvement as painters. From an artistic standpoint, Miguel is highly qualified. He attended RISD for undergrad and the Columbia MFA program. 
Although he is a working artist, Miguel takes his job as a professor seriously. He brings hardcover books to class to teach us about a variety of artists. The way he is able to discuss art is unlike any Art History professor I've had. He brings an artist's eye, and a fascination with the personal backgrounds of artists, to his teaching. While touring MoMA as a class, Miguel illuminated the work of Rousseau, Picasso, Mondrian, Dali etc. by telling us historical anecdotes about their lives.
Our class was able to visit the Met and MoMA, and even took the train out to Dia Beacon (a Minimalist sculpture garden about an hour outside of NYC) for a day. During the last class, we had the opportunity to tour Miguel's studio in Harlem. As Miguel led our class into his brick warehouse, two of his neighbors called out, ""Miguel, you're a professor? Who knew?!"" This interaction only confirms Miguel's humility. In his studio, we gaped at Miguel's surrealistic oil paintings and life-size sculptures of jungle animals. Not many art professors allow students to walk into their personal studios. 
By the end of the semester, our class felt like a family. We bonded over museum visits, mutual appreciation for Miguel, late nights in the studio, and lunch breaks. Take this class first and foremost if you want to learn how to paint, but don't be surprised if you make a few close friends along the way.

Worst professor I've ever had at Columbia. Or anywhere. 
As someone with a very intense musical background and intense musical appreciation, taking Music Hum with Professor Mailman actually made me like music less. This is not to say that Professor Mailman is not a hard-working professor who deeply cares about the material--this is to say that Professor Mailman brought an intensely arrogant attitude to our biweekly classes. He was very weirdly misogynistic which was extremely off-putting not to mention a dick. He came in with an attitude that everyone understood the jargon he was using even though my classmates were for the most part non-musicians. As a musician I felt alienated by Professor Mailman--I cannot imagine what my peers were feeling when he would throw around expert musical jargon and expect everyone to follow what he was saying. That said, classes were thoroughly thoroughly boring. Professor Mailman spoke in a monotonous (but simultaneously cocky) tone for a good hour and a half every class. He assigned a shitload of work that no one actually did and then he looked mad when he realized no one listened to the three hours worth of music he put on Courseworks. No shit. 
Professor Mailman also focused a great deal (too much) on the theoretical aspect of music. We spent three classes on Sonata Form and we didn't really talk about the ways in which music is a deeply personal, intimate experience. He made learning about music the opposite of enjoyable. 
If you get him as a music hum professor, SWITCH OUT. I am serious. Do it for you--don't make the mistake I did and stick it out with him for a semester.

I literally never did any work for this class. If you're a poli sci major and you don't want to do anything (as in not attend classes, not attend discussion sections, not do readings), this is THE class for you. 
I had really high hopes for this class given Andrew Nathan's prestige and all, but I found that I was ALWAYS put to sleep by his voice. There's something about it that is so monotonous that it lulls me to sleep and there really was no fighting it. Additionally, Professor Nathan's lecture style is horrible in that the trajectory of his sentences reflect his train of thought. Horrible for taking notes--I gave up and stopped attending classes. 
I literally didn't attend lecture, discussion section and did not do any readings for a good two months. I completed two papers that were unrelated to things covered in lecture and got no points off on the take home midterm. I have never received a better score on a midterm than I did in Professor Nathan's class (keep in mind that I literally did not attend class). 
I'm not going to lie and tell you that I learned so much in this class because to be honest, I did not. I think I came out with the same amount of knowledge about China and ""Foreign policy"" in China as I had when I first entered the lecture with high hopes in January.

Page is AMAZING. I absolutely loved her class. At first she was slightly off-putting and came off a little aloof and too good for us but as the course went on, she became so approachable and so kind. I highly recommend emailing her to ask for museum suggestions if you ever travel anywhere because she will jump on that as an opportunity to give you a list of like 50 places to see complete with her personal annotations.
There are a lot of museum trips involved in her section, partly because she's a lecturer at the Met which really comes in handy for getting privileged access to certain appointment-only rooms which is awesome. Page is a clear, concise lecturer who made an 8:40 section worthwhile and extremely interesting. Take this class!

For the first time, a professor truly blew my mind. Khan is not only an excellent lecturer but also an incredibly knowledgeable man. His classes were always catchy, as much as I never felt the urge to disconnect and check my phone out of boredom. Going to class was never a chore but rather an hour and fifteen minutes of entertainment. Khan knows how to present the material in a very clear and understandable way and tends to use a lot of everyday life example to make concepts seem more approachable. He knows how to get his class' attention in pertaining and hilarious ways. 
Taking this class actually convinced me to pursue a sociology minor - that's how much I loved it! The content of the class was very interesting and the readings were just fantastic. His book, Privilege, still stays in my mind.

First and foremost, Jervis is not a bad lecturer at all. People tend to criticize him for the simple reason that he is relatively old and thus quite slow and for the fact that it is hard to hear what he says (it's the microphone's fault - not his). Jervis is an incredibly knowledgeable man who has remarkable experience in the field of international politics. He always started his lectures with approximately a half hour about current affairs which very often related to the content of the course itself. Lectures were not organized, but very interesting. He presents a solid foundation in international relations theories and a clear presentation of relevant historical facts. Most students choose to not come to lecture - I think attendance isn't mandatory for full understanding of the course. The main points to take away come from the readings, which are very very exhaustive but usually interesting. 
This was my first class in the Political Science department and was exactly what I had expected. Content is great, lecturer is brilliant, workload is challenging and grading isn't easy. But the class really is worth taking.
I also attended Renanah Miles' discussion section every week. She is a great TA with remarkable experience and really knows how to clarify all the concepts seen during lecture.

I think people are missing the point with some of these reviews. Most of what I've read sounds like it was a judgement made on the first day of class and then the person just held onto that for a whole semester.
Yogesh is brilliant, no one on this page argues with how intelligent he is. Now here's a question; if your teacher is brilliant, and knows the texts way better than you ever will, why wouldn't you try to learn from him? He's the teacher, that's the point of the class.
You will get nothing out of this class if you don't put anything into it. Yogesh is a demanding professor who wants you to think critically about the texts. If you want to make up your own interpretation and never be challenged on it, take a different section. In class he is going to offer his own interpretations, and I know some people don't like being told things that contradict what they think. It's not that he wants you to just blindly accept everything he says, its that in order to have a nuanced conversation you need to be able to understand what he is saying. Most of his notes require a lot of thought to fully comprehend, I know I usually only fully got them after hours of writing an essay.
With this in mind, you will be far better off if you try to understand where he is coming from on each text. The reason he shuts people down in class is because their arguments don't make much sense. If he challenges ideas (what people have called condescending) it is usually just, ""What do you mean by that?"" or ""How do you define X?"" and other questions that make you reflect on your interpretations. If your ideas don't work, and you can't articulate them, then you need to fix them. That's not a mean professor, that's a great professor. Learning means changing what you think, if you think the same thing the same way before and after a class you didn't learn anything.
This class is difficult, not an easy A, but it is possible. If you are taking CC because it is a requirement and couldn't care less, do not take his class. Yogesh requires you to think deeply about each text. If you want to learn the texts and are willing to put in work, this is the best class you can take. I would say he is one of the best professors I've had at Columbia.
Also, GO TO OFFICE HOURS! He is extremely helpful and can help make sure you understand each text before he moves on to the next one. CC builds on itself, so it is dangerous to start falling behind early.

I'll get the important stuff out of the way first:
Unless you are a math (or related) major and/or coming fresh out of an exceptionally rigorous AP Calc course, do not take Calc I with Paul. 
Now that we have that out of the way, here's the ""nitty-gritty."" Paul is an exceptionally nice guy, he's very approachable, and he hasn't been grown to hate teaching yet. He really loves math (and fun dorky jokes peppered throughout his lectures). But if you don't know from experience already, mastery of a subject doesn't always mean that you can impart this knowledge in digestible terms to newcomers. 
The beginning of the course is a fairly comprehensive (albeit, short) review of key pre-calc and trig concepts. If you don't know them already, don't expect him to take the time to stop and explain it to you. Not only will you most likely end up more confused than you were, but you'll also be leaving less time for him to explain the heaping pile of material he crams into one period. Your best option is to scribble a note about the things you don't understand and take care of it on your own time. 
About that ""own time,"" though: don't expect to have too much of it. Written homework and WebAssign problems are assigned every week. The WebAssign problems are annoying (due to the strict syntax you have to use when inputting answers), but shouldn't take you more than 2 to 3 hours, max. The written homework is an entirely different animal. On average, I spent 7-8 hours on written homework, per week. Rather than enforcing newly-learned concepts through repetition and slight variation, Prof. Siegel likes to use problems that are ""exceptions to the rule,"" or that hinge heavily upon identities that were either, a: never introduced in the class, or b: brushed over during a lecture. As a result, you most likely will not completely learn the course's material unless you spend a lot of time practicing it in your free time.
I can hear you already: ""This guy writing the review is an idiot. There's no way the class demands that much time."" An idiot I may be, but I can safely say that I was among the majority in experiencing these difficulties with this class. When he posts homework, a deluge of his students populate the Math Help Room, and they steadily comprised the majority of the population for the entire semester. The TAs in the room constantly comment about how difficult the homework problems are, and often, THEY have trouble solving them. On more than one occasion, a group of us have worked through a problem with a TA for over two hours. It got to the point where I was greeted with groans and ""oh god, I'm sorry..."" when they heard which class we needed help with. 
Difficulty aside, the other main problem with Professor Siegel is his lack of communication. Emails go unanswered for weeks, his office hours are so densely populated that they turn into a pseudo-tutoring section (which is sometimes extremely helpful, but more often serves to confuse), homework isn't handed back for weeks (usually after the exam for which it would be most relevant), and the grading policy is as clear as a puddle of mud. He explains at the beginning of class that the entire course (not individual assignments) will be ""curved somewhat,"" but doesn't explain what it will be curved toward. Given that the average grade on the first exam was a ""D-,"" and the second only improved to a ""C,"" hopefully the curve is pretty generous. Regardless of the curve, this should be a big blinking indicator that your students are struggling. 
I'm sure that if you have an extremely solid foundation in calc, Paul is an instructor who will challenge you and help you to investigate the less common components of a calculus curriculum. If that doesn't describe you, find another professor. I have never encountered a more demanding course.

I had this whole review written out, in which I tried hard to find flaws with Professor Pedatella and inflate them so that my praise would seem balanced and objective, because I’m suspicious of simplicity. Purely rave reviews tend to leave something out, and to feel a bit blind or even biased as a result. I really wanted this to not be one of those reviews.
But then I saw the below review, realized I was being ridiculous, and wrote what I actually think instead.
Professor Pedatella treats the material like something young and alive, as if despite however many years of teaching, To the Lighthouse can still surprise him. When he lectures it’s as if he’s been thinking about these theories for years and this is the first time he’s ever gotten to tell someone about them. (Not to say that his teaching style is at all amateurish, far from it, only that his enthusiasm is beyond anything I’ve ever encountered in someone who’s been teaching as long as he has). Additionally, he seems to know more or less everything related to the Western canon, and is happy to explain intertextual allusions that would otherwise be almost impossible to catch. However, in spite of his, quite frankly, intimidating knowledge base, Professor Pedatella never acts like what a student has to say is obvious or unintelligent. He will disagree with students from time to time, but he is always very clear that his opinion in nothing more than just that: his opinion. In the class or in your essays it’s easier to simply agree with him, because he will smile and nod and move past you, but if you ever come up with something that’s yours (whether it clashes with his point, drives it forward in a direction he hadn’t considered, or ignores him altogether) that is when he will challenge you, and in doing so make you feel a real connection with the text, as though you are a participant in this millennia long conversation, just as much as Virgil or Chaucer or Keats. (Okay, maybe not just as much, but pretty damn close.)
A friend of mine who entered his class with almost no literary background, having gone to fancy music schools her whole life, put it nicely when she said, “He makes literature sing.” I’d have to agree. His interpretations helped me write a response to Keats’ Ode to a Nightingale (which is far and away the most ambitious poetry project I have ever attempted), and class discussion has prompted me to write quite a few short stories.
In sum, Professor Pedatella is the most inspirational teacher I have ever encountered. I really cannot recommend him highly enough.

The only reason not to take this class with Daniel Hsu is if you already have a full workload for the semester. It's great but pretty difficult.
The overall curriculum of the course is heavily mathematical. There is relatively little concern with ""real-world"" issues like cleaning data or choosing good features. There were some students who sounded like they wanted a course that would teach them how to apply canned algorithms from sklearn or something. It's more about how to implement those algorithms.
The first half covered classification problems of various kinds, followed by some learning theory. There's some statistics which comes from a really interesting and unique perspective. It's the first time I've felt statistics wasn't boring. The second half covered unsupervised learning (clustering, etc.) and Markov models. Sprinkled throughout are theoretical discussions of optimization techniques used to fit various models. Finally, the last few lectures were just topics that the professor thought would be enriching, most notably a lecture on how rating prediction systems like Netflix actually work.
The class structure is pretty normal -- readings (that you can get by without doing), lectures, and problem sets, plus two exams.
The course had a Piazza board, which the professor was always watching. He would give clear, excellent answers, even at weird hours in the middle of the night. He also remained available the night before a problem set. I thought it was nice that he didn't pretend we had good time management skills, although I agree floating late days would have been good, or at least penalties for late assignments rather than refusing to accept them outright.
The lecture slides are all posted online and are detailed and excellent. I didn't need to take any notes. But this doesn't mean it's not worth going to lectures! Prof. Hsu is a good lecturer, although sort of quiet. His explanations perfectly complemented the slides. When students asked questions, he listened carefully and gave very clear and cogent answers.
We covered a ton of ground, at a decent level of mathematical sophistication. I think perhaps the professor overestimated our mathematical competence. However, those high expectations along with his good teaching skills made this a great class. Hopefully Columbia keeps him around. 
Workload:
Problem sets were difficult but not insanely so. They were usually a mixture of ""easy"" problems to test basic understanding, programming problems, and one or two proofs. There were never any problems that were unsolvable without knowing some kind of trick or having a deep insight -- hard work was always enough to get them.
The programming problems were in MATLAB, and usually consisted of training a classifier on a dataset that had already been ""cleaned"" into a nice format. Getting the code to work correctly was usually easy, but the datasets were large enough that efficiency was actually a serious issue, requiring lots of MATLAB tricks.
Exams were another story. There were two non-cumulative exams, both in-class. There was not enough time for the first exam, and the questions for both were quite difficult and often required a lot of creativity under time pressure. It was not enough to just recall the lecture material -- you had to really understand everything on a gut level. The median was very low for both exams.

To be quite honest, I don’t know what I was expecting from this class. Both here at Columbia and in high school, military history was never really explored in depth beyond, “These are important battles, actors, etc.” We never did battle analyses and we were often more concerned with the outcomes and impacts of the wars rather than the techniques, generals, ships, weaponry, etc. So I thought that this class might be an exciting way for me to learn more about an area of history that I have not yet covered. 
While Jackson is obviously very passionate about this material, he was often very, very unprepared. The lectures were haphazard, often going on tangents, with generally unhelpful PowerPoints that were either vague maps or incredibly long and detailed list of dates of battles, involving specific troop movements. The material covered was covered in the wrong order, at the wrong level of detail, with small details that you would have to put together into the bigger picture, rather than the other way around. I would much rather have a general overview of the war, know some key battles, general movements, technologies, strategies, etc. that influenced the war and its outcome, rather than have a litany of events in North Africa, then Europe, then the Pacific, then Korea, etc. 
I would have also appreciated knowing how these wars affected the home front and social conditions. This was a HUGE topic in all of my history classes before and this could have been explored in more depth in a class like this, but instead we got a few cursory points about Pals Battalions and the home front in New York during World War II and the Holocaust in Nazi Germany (which were two of the best lectures, btw). 
Like I said, Jackson is incredibly motivated and knows what he’s talking about. I just wish that the lectures were better organized and I wish we spent less time watching films (I know, shocker! but I got nothing out of them, and felt my time was better spent doing readings for other classes or even just going on Facebook). We had a few lectures by one of Jackson’s colleagues at Purchase College, Professor Lisa Keller, and her lectures were ORGANIZED, COHERENT AND MADE AN ARGUMENT! These are what Jackson’s lectures should have been! I don’t come to class to get what amounts to reading the Wikipedia page. I would like to be able to understand what happened, what the professor thinks, and then go from there. 
This was the first time Jackson offered this class and on the very last day he apologized that more people did not like the class. He seemed open to suggestions written on the evaluation, so hopefully in the future this course will take a more comprehensive, or at least ORGANIZED!!! look at warfare in the modern world. 
The class was very focused on World War II. Seriously, we spent half the class on it. We spent two lectures on a general history and theory of war, two for exam review, three lectures on the Civil War, two for World War I, fifteen (!!) lectures on World War II in North Africa, Europe and the Pacific, one on Korea and Vietnam, and one on the Gulf and Afghanistan and Iraq wars. In all I have a very comprehensive understanding of World War II, which as definitive as it was, is perhaps vital to understanding the present. 
We also had a number of veterans in the class, and though Jackson made attempts to incorporate their experiences in the class, I would have liked to hear them more as primary sources about the war, and their experiences in it, as a sort of exercise in oral history. It could have been a very rich way to introduce students the historiography of war, so I hope that if Jackson is reading this, he will incorporate it in the future. I would have also appreciated hearing their opinions on how studying versus living in war are different. 
The upshot was that this class was generally very forgiving. The midterm and final were very fair and the grading on the essays were equally fair. Reading was light, though Jackson would often assign hundreds of pages at a time, so note! and make sure to keep them spaced out. 
The TA's were generally accessible and helpful, though they did say they would upload the PowerPoints for the final, though they didn't.

Not too bad, light for a history class.
Readings -- for history, light. Mostly Keegan’s books “The Mask of Command,” “The Price of Admiralty” and “The Face of Battle.” Also included were Toland’s “The Rising Sun” and Bradley’s “The Flags of Our Fathers,” each in their entirety, which were never discussed in class. One of the essay options for both the final and midterm consisted solely on the readings, so you may want to do it, though it is pretty optional. 
Extracurricular Participation -- 10% -- involved going to the Intrepid or the Museum of Jewish Heritage, and writing a one page report. Also, you could go on the class trip to Gettysburg. 
Letter from the Somme and Movie Reflection -- 10% -- Letter from the Somme: write a letter to your wife/mother as a private fighting in the Somme. Movie Reflection: write three pages about a war movie, a list is included in the syllabus. Really open-ended. 
Battle Analysis -- 20% -- 3 to 5 page analysis of a battle in a war between Waterloo and World War II. Not too difficult, though you are expected to do research for this. N.B. Columbia’s war history collection is mostly offsite so you’ll have to either go to NYPL (like I did) or plan it more than three days in advance (which was hard, since the assignment was not given out until the Wednesday before it was due)
Midterm -- 20% -- 6 ID’s and an essay (6 bluebook pages). Straightforward though one of the IDs (von Blücher) was a figure from Waterloo, which was covered only in the readings. 
Final -- 40% -- 10 ID’s and two essays (4 bluebook pages each). Straightforward. Essay questions were incredibly, incredibly broad, making it easier than the midterm.

Like the review below, I had a good time in Karen’s CC section, so I will refrain from repeating it. I agree with most everything they said: she had a sort of humor that some people did not appreciate, or were less obvious in their appreciation of it. That being said, she was very careful to illuminate all the points of the reading that she thought were important, or that others thought were important. 
She did, however, seem to be a little too eager to solicit class participation. She would often stop what she was saying as someone raised their hand, and I would rather she finish what she had to say, then call on the person, so that they could form a discussion. That’s not to say we didn’t have discussions, but I felt that most of the comments from the students were often very, very discursive (one brought up his aunt’s experience in Macedonia under Tito, and another brought up a comment Karen made **literally** a month earlier), yet she often entertained these sorts of comments by replying to them. 
But, all in all, she is a good CC professor who will only improve as she teaches the course. She is more than fair when it comes to grading, and often praised the class for our successes on the exams and essays. She isn’t some amazing professor, definitely not gold-nugget material, though she is a solid professor and if you have her, I would not change. 
One thing to note is that Karen makes some very liberal changes to the syllabus. I felt that some were very welcome, while others would have been better left off. That being said, she is careful to introduce ideas that are important in academia, especially from a leftist slant, which she will come at you with **very explicitly**. Seriously, she is incredibly well-read in all sorts Marxist theory, and will often take the time to explain it. She once spent quite a bit of time explaining the theory of nations. But she is very open to understanding all other ideas and, as long as you can support them, will be more than happy to entertain them and take you seriously. 
For second semester, if you are **really, really** looking forward to reading Wollstonecraft, Woolf, Du Bois, Fanon, etc., then you should switch out. She removed all of those authors and replaced them with “Dead White Men.” She did add, however, Toussaint Louverture and other documents from the Haitan Revolution. The additions were welcome, though I would have appreciated reading Woolf, Du Bois, Woolstonecraft, etc., even if just for their historical importance. 
To give you an example of the changes she made, just looking at the CC website, I can tell you we did not read (or read different selections than my other friends): American Revolution texts, Burke, Wollstonecraft, Du Bois, Woolf, The New Testament,  or Scientific Revolution texts. If having these texts is important to you, then I suggest you change. However, you may appreciate the different slant she takes, so if you think you would enjoy it, I would definitely stay. 
In all, Karen is a very solid choice. She will entertain you with stories of mango peelers in Washington Heights, her Marxist take on almost every aspect of life, and *incredibly* obscure references. I found her hilarious and am very glad to have been able to take her section. 

Workload:
Very manageable. 
Reading is often < 50 pages per class, very rarely does it exceed that amount. 
First semester had two 5-6 page essays (40%) and 2 page response papers (20%). Prompts are given. Final and midterm were 10% each. Participation was 20%. 
Second semester had one 2 page response (15%), a 4 page critical summary (15%) and a 6 page essay (30%). Prompts are given. Final and midterm were 10% each. Participation was 20%. 
For essays, she values style, clarity and organization. If they are well-planned and well-written, you will likely do well. 
Midterm and essay consisted of five IDs, and two very short essays (200 words each). She is somewhat strict about word count and length, so be concise. Each was only 10% of the grade and noncumulative, so no need to worry. She gave the prompts for the essays in advance, and would select among those prompts for the exam. 
Like the review below, I recommend her section.

Noémie is just great.
After hearing everyone else's UW experiences, I can confidently say that I was very grateful to have Noémie for UW. She tries her hardest to make the class interesting and relevant to everyone. She holds mandatory one-on-one conferences before you start each progression to discuss your ideas with you. These are extremely helpful and allow you to be right on track with your writing. I NEVER had to rewrite an essay from scratch, because Noémie makes sure your ideas fit into what's expected of you during these conferences. Her grading was very prompt and the feedback she gives is relevant, practical and helpful. I must also add that she has been the only faculty member who I felt cared about me personally and not just on an academic level, which is always great and comforting.

Beau is the man. I lack words to describe him as a professor. If you take him, it's a guaranteed 4h of intellectual orgasm a week, plus the countless other hours you'll spend thinking about the stuff he said and was discussed in class. He has inspired me to take more classes in philosophy, to become a better person by thinking about my actions, and perhaps most importantly, to become a better thinker. Want a class that helps you develop power of thought? Take CC with the Beau. This class has probably made the entire Columbia experience worthwhile--he's that great.

Work really doesn't matter that much. It requires time, sure, but within the first weeks you'll be so engaged in the class that you'll actually look forward to reading the texts and writing those response papers.

Despite her intelligence, renown here, (Moodygate) credentials, (she was Rawls' grad student and has previously worked in positions of power in several big-name schools) and being highly regarded in her field, she is personable, kind, and more than ready--excited, really--to talk to students. 
If you communicate with her one-on-one at all she will make you want to be a philosophy major.
She taught a section herself this semester, and was constantly referring in class to ""new insights"" that her students had given her. While I was skeptical that a person of such experience could be really impressed/surprised with student contributions, it was nice to discover that she's not as jaded as many. 
The philosophers discussed were many and varied, and overall she did a good job of providing much of the spectrum of ethical thought. She also likes art, and worked architecture and painting in without losing touch with the goal of the lecture.
Past reviews are true, she does read off the slides, but also adds her own insights that are invaluable not only educationally but also for writing the papers (and this is coming from someone who had never written a philosophy-style paper before this class, so believe me, I needed whatever she would give me content-wise as well as stylistically). It's not necessary to take notes all the time, which I liked, but anything that's not on the slides (and not a strange tangent) you should probably write down. Boredom in lectures is also real, but she is super quirky (slide typos lol) and I can't emphasize the extent of her intelligence and knowledge enough. Sections are fine, better if you really enjoy philosophical discussions. She has little or nothing to do with actual grading, so TA interaction is super important.

I honestly don't understand some of these reviews of Gamber. He's a great lecturer, sure, who's glib and funny and sarcastic and witty, but there isn't much else there. The books were all fantastic, but it's in the assessment of the class that I really began to lose patience with the guy.
Gamber really doesn't seem to want to read papers. His midterm was identifying and writing a short essay on two passages from the books, and were graded solely on whether or not you could identify the books and then wrote something that resembled an essay for the new four paragraphs -- each essay was worth 5 points, two of which were simply identifying the author and the title of the book correctly. Then there was a paper, which seemed to have been graded pretty harshly, and a brutal final which was simply just identifying obscure passages from the novels. I'd read most of the books, and couldn't work out most of the passages.
Simply put, Gamber is a great lecturer, but doesn't seem too invested in actually measuring how much we've learned in the class

I've reviewed two previous classes with Yannakakis (December 17, 2013 and May 02, 2014 reviews) both of which I liked. Approximation Algorithms was more of the same -- he may not be super charismatic or exciting, but he's a thorough, and incredibly knowledgeable professor (the course covers quite a range of topics, but he's up to date on the latest in all of them; it's not unusual for him to say, ""we'll be discussing this version of the algorithm, but 6 months ago researchers X and Y came up with a much better version...""). He posts great lecture notes, gives interesting homework and has TAs who grade fairly. The homework in particular deserves a shout-out, as it felt much more like puzzle-solving than the drudgery most CS classes force you through. The final research project was a lot of fun, as someone who hadn't done one before.
Also, I found the CS Theory -> Computational Complexity -> Approximation Algorithms sequence with Yannakakis worked very nicely (the assumed background knowledge matches pretty closely to what he's taught in his previous courses), and I'm guessing if I'd taken Algorithms I with him, too, it would've been even better.

All Teachers College Columbia pre-service students are required to take the C&T 4000 Disabilities course. 
I found this to be VERY interesting course, and it's definitely a class that every future educator should take. A typical class consists of a close reading analysis, group presentation, and debate & discussion. I found Dr. Wilson to be very analytical, impartial, and grounded in reality in our class debates. He won't hesitate to question your claims, so be prepared to defend your argument if he confronts you. I also very much like that Dr. Wilson has given us a realistic portrayal of the teaching world. He made it clear that it will be demanding, perhaps even miserable, especially in the first year of teaching. The material covered in this class will definitely make any would-be teacher question his/her/x's initial motives for going into the teaching profession.
Despite this, the class had a laid-back feel to it, the professor kept the class grounded and facilitated debates well, and all of my brilliant classmates contributed their own unique perspectives to the class which made for a truly thought-provoking, intellectually pivotal experience.

Don't take this class. Mawhinney's impression in class is that of someone that cares a lot about the subject and is overall responsible.  Too bad that's not the case.  He takes about a week to get any given problem set out, which has its ups and downs. It probably led to larger problem sets, but the guy intended to give us 8 to 10 projects (each of the ones we DID have took 10-20 hours).  The problem sets are riddled with typos that, if called out on, he'll duly ignore. He doesn't respond to emails or show up to office hours despite urging everyone to come to him for help.  
He doesn't teach anyone to code, which, although I came in pretty good at it, defeats part of the purpose of this course.  He has short recitations on Fridays that give you a crash course in C that showed up scarcely on two of the problem sets.  His lectures are decent, but the content has nothing to do with the work you're expected to do.  He gives you a week or less to code something, which isn't kosher for gigantic programming projects.  The problem sets, aside from the typos, are loaded with ambiguity as to what to do.  The best parts are when he's flat out wrong as in the fourth and fifth one where he makes erroneous assumptions about the calculation of energy or giving you an algorithm for symmetric matrices to run on matrices that aren't symmetric.  When approached with some questions about the last problem set, he flat out admitted he didn't do his own problem set and that a lot of the assumptions he made as to how to do it didn't hold up.  On top of that, it was about PDE's and he didn't teach us anything about how to handle boundary conditions.
The icing on the cake is that he gave us a problem set due in the middle of reading week. The day after, he gave us a ""cumulative"" final programming project that was about one topic, and it was something that he didn't talk about at all in the class and that took ~15-20 hours during finals week.  
Flat out the worst class I ever took in the department. I'm sure his 4081 class, given the 5 undergrads still in this 4080 class, will be a raging success next year.

The worst, most disorganized class experience I have ever had.
He never gave us a syllabus at the beginning of the semester. A syllabus should include: office hours; grade breakdown (how much of your grade will be based on tests and assignments); when the midterm is; when all assignments are due; etc. His syllabus merely had a list of chapters from the textbook that we would be studying and none of the essential items mentioned above. As a result, I have no idea what my grade will be, since I don't know how much of it will be based on assignments and how much of it will be based on exams.
The assignments were vague and expectations were never clear. When we would have assignments was also very unpredictable, there was no regular due date and he would often spring them on us a week before they were due, so it was very difficult to budget my time while taking this class. Most professors usually have a regular due date every week for problem sets (psets are due on every Thursday at 5pm, for example) or else the syllabus would include when they were due, but Birol did not do this.
The midterm was a complete disaster. He did not tell us when the midterm would be at the beginning of the semester; we found out that the midterm would be on the day of the withdrawal deadline about three weeks before the midterm, so there was no way to withdraw from the class if you did poorly on the midterm. He also gave us very little information about the format of the midterm, so it was impossible to study for it. The midterm was also a take home midterm, the type where you open it in CourseWorks and you have a certain amount of time to do it before submissions close. He gave us five hours to complete the midterm, from the time you open it on CourseWorks, and he also only gave us one day during which we could complete it. The day he gave us to complete it happened to be a Thursday, which was a day this semester when I did not have a five hour chunk of time to complete a midterm and he would not let me (or anyone else) take the midterm on another day, so I had to skip other classes in order to take the midterm.
The final project also did not have clear enough instructions. Vague, vague, vague, no one knew what they were doing and (as mentioned below) he doesn't return emails, so there was no way to clarify the instructions.
He also is terrible with correspondence. He rarely responds to emails--I have heard of exactly one instance from everyone I knew in the class where he actually responded to an email; other than that, sending him an email was essentially sending an email to a black hole. He also still hasn't returned the midterm, even though we've already taken the final.
Birol submitted grades two weeks late. He did not grade the final or the midterm, or if he did, it was never entered into courseworks. I have no idea how I made the passing grade that I did, as I only turned in one homework out of four and received no grade or feedback on either exam.

Oh man. What a terrible, terrible, terrible class. What a truly frustrating experience. I'm aware that Rubenstein is not teaching fundamentals next semester, but I don't care, because the world needs to know how fucking terrible he was for fundamentals, so that hopefully nobody will have to go through it if he ever teaches it again.
THE LECTURES:
Prof. Rubenstein reads from his slides. Word-for-word. The lectures are aggressively boring, to the point where Rubenstein himself would get bored––at which point he would tell a bizarre and completely unrelated story (""So this one time I had a 6AM flight, and I was staying at the airport, so I told my friend I could wake up at 5:45 and make the flight, and then I actually did it, just to see if I could, but I forgot that security still takes like two hours even if you're sleeping in the airport, so I ended up missing that flight. Anyway"")––and then get back to some of the most amazingly uninspiring lecturing I have ever witnessed. I can't believe I consistently went to this class. It's a waste of time.
THE HOMEWORKS:
Always tedious, and the questions are often extremely unclear. Unfortunately, the homeworks are only tangentially related to the slides/the classes, so 80 percent of the work you'll be doing on these homeworks is figuring out what he actually wants you to do. There were 8 graded homeworks this semester––there were supposed to be 9, but somehow, even though we do literally nothing in class, Rubenstein fell behind, so that there was a 9th ungraded one (but it was still fair game for the final!)
THE TESTS:
As annoying as the homeworks are, the tests are a worse version of the homeworks. Completely unrelated to the tasks you do for the HW and the slides, these tests are difficult, confusing, and don't really reflect your understanding of the material. Every question introduces a new concept, so that you will be scrambling to read through his (often error-riddled) questions until you figure out the game for that particular question.
THE MAN HIMSELF:
The thing is that I actually kind of like Rubenstein––he can be funny and he's kind of a goofball. But he is just a truly bad teacher.
Please, for your own sake, don't take fundamentals with him.

For anyone considering taking Beau Shaw, a few words of warning. His class is 'intellectually engaging' in that he attempts to make philosophy interesting. Though you probably won't fall asleep in class and he keeps conversation interesting, the work you do for his is very time-consuming as compared to other CC sections. The papers especially are a struggle because of their much greater length. The midterm and final are straightforward. His grading is very inconsistent and unclear, and he is absolutely unflinching on changing your grade after he decides it. His method of calculating the final grade is also not clear. Overall, Shaw is completely undeserving of the gold nugget he has- I'm almost certain there are professors who can both facilitate good discussion and not give busy work.

It is with great disdain that I write this review. You don't really have a choice about taking this class. So, the issue is how best to cope. 
Issues with the course: 
Too many topics covered in very little depth 
Insane problem sets with hundreds of problems summing up each unit (not necessarily helpful)
Powerpoint lectures with many mistakes in them, and contain tons of extraneous information 
No formula sheets for exams. The final therefore means memorizing hundreds of formulas and being able to ""free-recall"" on command. 
Issues with the professor: 
Charnick is rude and condescending. Naturally, that makes her unapproachable. I cannot emphasize this enough. 
She assigned a problem set due the Monday of finals. 
Makes her exams way too long for a 50 minute period. Absolutely no time to check over work. You will most definitely run out of time taking one of her exams. Sorry. 
Very poor handwriting and talks in monotone...very poor note delivery on the board. 
Can't explain the material properly!

I have so many things to say about Nancy that I don't even know where to start, but first off, I'd like to encourage anyone who is put in her class to STAY IN IT. Even though the workload is heavier than most other LitHum classes, it all pays off, and Nancy herself is well worth the effort. Professor Workman not only knows every single text on the syllabus back to front, but actually makes even the most dull of them totally fascinating. She sheds so much light on every text that you have to end up with some kind of appreciation for them. By the end of the year, you'll probably realize that you've even come to develop some kind of fondness for the Iliad. She's also hilarious-- she can make the class laugh, whether with a personal anecdote or a snarky remark, at 9 a.m. Considering the frugal amounts of sleep you get at Columbia, this is a miracle. She is extremely thorough and supportive. Though tough, she DOES read and DOES care about every single daily assignment that you turn in. She'll sometimes write whole paragraphs of her own thoughts or questions on your response. Always take the time to meet with her about your term papers-- the meeting are informative and instructive, and I've often found that I come out with an entirely new topic or idea that I'm actually excited to write about. At the end of each semester, she hosts a review session at her apartment, which is not only helpful but interesting. In addition to the reviews, she hosted a screening of a 1980s Japanese film version of King Lear halfway through the second semester. There's always nice cats and pizza at her apartment. Definitely an invitation that most professors at Columbia would not extend to their students. Anticipate the discussions on Crime and Punishment at the end of the year; she will absolutely boggle you. Take advantage of this wonderful professor! Even at Columbia, you don't get great professors like Nancy that often. It's LitHum, that one class you hear about like 83 times before you even get here-- make the most of it!

Lisa Son is one of the worst, if not THE worst, professor I have ever had in my life. Her slides are incomprehensible without notes to accompany it, and even then, it's hard to make heads or tails of what she is saying. She will add in pictures or ideas that come to her mind and put them in slides that follow concepts but are not connected to that concept whatsoever. 
Her tests could not be more convoluted. Not only are her questions worded ridiculously, but there are also multiple right answers to the questions. She will sometimes give everyone credit when she notices that literally everyone in the class got a question wrong. Not only that, she never admits that she is wrong. There were multiple times this semester when she was simply factually incorrect and she refused to acknowledge it. She is so stuck on her high horse that she says things like ""I don't understand why this is a difficult concept"" or ""I think this is really easy.""

I've known Sharp for 3 years and she was my adviser until recently. I used to like her quite a bit -- she is undoubtedly smart and an accomplished anthropologist. At her best, she teaches you how to be systematic in your writing and to meet unreasonable standards. The most you'll get out of her course is a real life experience of Horrible Bosses or The Devil Wears Prada translated to academia.
Only take a class with Sharp if you the kind of person who can put up with bullshit. The most successful route dealing with her is to sit down, and shut up. Participate enough to get credit and look like you read the material, but just say what she wants to hear. She consistently picks a ""favorite"" in the class, along with a person to shit on and make an example of regardless of your knowledge or effort. I've been in both roles. I was the favorite when I was a first year because I kissed her ass. When she became my adviser and we got to know each other better, the tables turned. Despite every effort to engage with the reading material, it seemed the more 'myself' I acted, the more she just hated me. I watched her do the same thing as a first year to a senior major in EFR in NYC. Sharp gave her a C even though that student seemingly did all that was required on the syllabus. 
All in all, she has an incredibly limited view of anthropology and what a student/teacher relationship should look like. Don't push that in any way... (and you'll know that you've offended her - she'll start to be really dismissive of anything and everything you say in class and she'll fuck you on grades)
Really, just avoid her at all costs. I've talked shit about Sharp to two other anthropology professors in the Barnard department, and they both talked shit about her right back. She's just an unpleasant person. Anyone who says differently was one of the favorites.

Rob is a darling. He teaches calc in a very straight forward way. The main benefit of going to the class is seeing all the examples worked out until it gets arithmetic-y and he just circles the ""good enough for him"" answer. Thank god, because I hate arithmetic. He's definitely a math nerd, and I mean that in the most endearing way possible. That being said, he doesn't like or allow calculators and thinks they are crutches. And, considering that I remember nothing from my calculus that I took years ago WITH a calculator - he may be right. I was a previous Cog Sci and History major at my past schools so I spent a lot of time memorizing cool stories and fun brain stuffs. I did not do math for forever and used a calculator to add single digits to check myself. 
He also doesn't allow cheat sheets. It's really tough to remember all the formulas correctly, and I prayed for the final that he'd allow just a teeny post-it, but alas...no cheat sheet (post it, etc.) allowed. I missed signs on the final but really started to think about the concept behind it to see if I could infer the forgotten signs (some SERIOUS math was going on in my head) but my feeble mind kept getting distracted by how cold it was in the room.
He's really super available and open during office hours - but (as I'm sure you know from all your other classes' office hours) you'll get the most if you come loaded with questions. I know some people came for recapitulations on the last week's lectures that they missed - but he will tell you to go read the book if you come for that. He doesn't help you get exact answers on homework. He'll help you figure out your next steps or see where you went wrong if you show him your work. He is a high-level explainer -but if you ask him to break it down in baby steps, he'll do that for you. But I actually have heard mixed opinions about that from other students. For me personally, he really spent a lot of time with me patiently explaining everything I didn't understand, but I am not one to pretend I understand something when I don't. I probably was the worst/slowest learner in the class. I think he knew this and took pity on me :\.
He's surprisingly social for a math guy, has a really bright smile on all the time, and can take a piss on himself (I dunno if that translates correctly in English - I mean he can joke at his own expense). This is sooooo helpful in making the class time and subject easier to swallow.
The workload is a little painful if you need a week to catch up because you fell ill or got caught up in something. You have to stay on it. When I was in the hospital for a week, I had to keep reviewing while going through treatment, or else I knew I'd be far behind. To drive that point home, I know several people in the class who sat through a columbia calc class last semester or took it at a CUNY the summer before before they took it for a letter grade here, and they said it's definitely easy to fall behind especially the weeks the written homeworks are assigned.
Written homeworks are sick and twisted. Sorry, you will spend an ungodly amount of hours staring through the paper. But luckily there are only 5 or so of them and they're spread out reallllly well. Go to office hours those weeks. And not just the class before they're due. Go as soon as they're assigned. Or hit Math help room at milbank. But don't let them do it for you. Those homeworks will make you want to puke but it's sorta cool to get an 80% on them knowing you actually got through them yourself (with a little bit of guidance.) 
Webassign is weekly and annoying. But that is the nature of webassign. PS, if you suck at trig stuff, doing the webassign only won't prepare you for the quizzes and especially the tests. You have to knock out problems in the book to get used to the types of questions asked on the tests. I thought in the beginning that webassign would be enough - my understanding improved significantly after I opened the book.
As far as test grading and curve... it's a Columbia Calc course. I think they're all the same so I've been told by numerous students and advisors. Don't beat yourself up after you've failed - everyone fails a little. The tests though, I wasn't afraid to speak up and say that the prep-midterms were different than the midterm we had to take. I think he takes our comments to heart. For example, the practice midterm had a whole bunch of polynomials and easier functions to manipulate, but ours was full of exponential variables to the exponential variables to the e to the ln of the absolute value of whatever.One thing a classmate mentioned to Rob that would be helpful is to focus his examples on solving more difficult sorts of these problems - lo and behold his examples were like 75% e/ln/multiple levels of exponential variables and things.
In summary, Rob is good at what he does. He's very sweet and helpful, but I get the feeling that you have to be proactive about asking for help. He's super young (looking, at least, I dunno how old he is) so he has a lot of energy and passion for math. I think he knows that it is unlikely that anyone in the class was a real math major and rather just needed the course for a pre-req to something else, but he still wants to give you the solid foundation you'll need when you go on to calc 2 or 3, etc. He can come off aloof so I've heard from others, but I've not experienced that at all. I think he's very warm, welcoming, and happy if you treat him like a human and not just someone who is there at your mercy. Buuut, my dad is a math PhD and my ex-boyfriend is en route toward one, so perhaps i'm just used to it.
Sorry for the dissertation length review.

How to even begin? I guess I should start by saying I'm an Art History Major. I know I know, why the f*%& am I taking this class? There's a very simple answer to that: WEI. ZHANG. I know it sounds cliche but this guy is the single best professor I've ever had. After his class, I etched his name on the mini Butler Library I have at home -- screw Demosthenes, Zhang has taken his place in the pantheon of legends. Zhang opened my eyes to the language of numbers, the intricate beauty of angles and the biting logic of his spectacular proofs. His poets were Euler and Lagrange. The numbers were flying off the board and fluttering all around me in a resplendent symphony. After his class, I was thinking in numbers. Math had entered my life. 
Have you ever walked out of class thinking, ""What the hell did that guy just say?"" Well with Wei, you can put those days behind you. The clarity with which Zhang presents the material -- it's like Sparknotes for Calc. And the preparation, my god. He takes difficult-to-grasp concepts and makes them accessible to the mathematically challenged among us. His homework is short but teaches you everything to know. That's a godsend when the other professors are giving twice or three times the number of problems. He gives a Webassign every week but gives you six tries for each problem (for multiple choice, you literally can't get it wrong) so you're guaranteed 100's. There's also a written homework every week but he's a generous grader.  
Now we all know that effectiveness is only one half of the battle -- we want personality. And Zhang has it in spades. The guy is never without a smile or a kind word, and is more than happy to take questions from the crowd. The banter that goes on really made this class not only one where I learned a tremendous amount but also actually enjoyed going to. His personal anecdotes are flat-out hilarious, and his Math puns are out of control.
If you are on the fence about taking Calculus III, hop off. Don't settle for any of the other professors -- ZHANG IS WORTH THE WAIT. And don't feel down if you're high on the waitlist, I was 38 and somehow got in (out of a total waitlist of 108 - for perspective, the other guy teaching in this time slot had 42 in his whole class, never mind a waitlist). Wei Zhang is not a mere man in my mind. His expertise, kindness, and all-around awesomeness propel him to the realm of the teaching gods. I think it was Rousseau who said, ""A great teacher can kindle flames that never die, open a well that will never dry, and move your dreams from earth to the sky."" Well Zhang is just that teacher.

Dr. Kehoe is just fantastic. I had her for Art Hum, and she made Art History one of my favorite topics to study. She is HILARIOUS, engaging, knowledgeable, approachable and amazing. She has a great sense of humor, which she incorporates into her lectures. Out of all of the core classes I have taken, I can recall the most information from Dr. Kehoe's class because of how memorable her lectures are. This was one of the few classes I regularly wished would last longer, each session. LOVE HER and take her if you have the chance. 
PROS: 
- trips to the Met & St. John's Cathedral
- everything about Dr. Kehoe
- the class discussions: it seemed like almost everyone participated because they wanted to
- the workload: very manageable
- the readings!!: very carefully selected; reasonable; no busywork
- the first paper: to analyze one of the buildings on campus; fun to do 
- doesn't expect you to memorize a billion dates and names of paintings - only the few you write on for the exams
CONS: 
- ... classes too short? Seriously, our entire class adored Dr. Kehoe, and I can't think of a single negative about the class 
- She might be leaving Columbia after her postdoctoral fellowship

Prof Holland was extremely disorganized and attempted to fill up class time with a lot of unnecessary fluff.  An inordinate amount of time was spent watching movies or going around the room reading documents aloud for 20 minutes at a time (not even analyzing said documents...just reading them aloud!).  There were a number of guest lecturers, brought in to fill up the time we could have spent engaged in meaningful discussion about the assigned readings. 

The class is very unstructured.  ""Lectures"" are disjointed, vague, aimless and repetitive. While it might be reasonable to focus on 'big picture' issues at the very beginning of the semester, by midterms period we should be digging deeper beneath the surface. It is unclear whether she has the expertise necessary to go below the surface on this topic. 
It was impossible to engage in real discussion during class. Students would make a few random comments here and there, and then back we'd go to reading aloud or movie watching!
In one-on-one interactions, she appeared scattered, insecure, uninformed, and unnecessarily defensive.  She is a nice human being, but may be ill-equipped to deal with students. 
Her grading scheme seems haphazard and highly subjective. Overall, there was a complete lack of transparency.
In sum, this class was taught in a way that seems inconsistent with graduate level education. Not worth your time, energy or $.

Loren is THE BEST. She absolutely deserves her gold nugget. She makes the class very manageable and easy to understand, and she never assigns too much work. Her class is also fun and social, with games and French songs. If you like sing-along, then this class is for you. 
Loren is also a fabulous dresser. Some people would say this is an unimportant quality in a professor, but I found it very inspiring seeing her all matching and in heels every day at 9am. It also makes you want to go to Paris, where everyone dresses fabulously - and making you want to go to Paris is really the goal of any intro French class. 
Loren is also so caring, understanding and approachable. If I ever had a problem understanding something or with an administrative thing, she would be so helpful. She is also a very easy grader if she sees that you are putting in effort. I got an A for this class both semesters, even though I got less than an A on several quizzes.

In spite of the sterling reviews this professor has received I venture to guess it has more to do with the fact that you can get an Econ credit by reading a measly few NYTimes articles per week. 
This teacher is unresponsive, apathetic, and, frankly in my opinion, just really, really lazy. She never responds to emails even when she has not sent out the time and location of the exam the day before the exam--leaving her students wondering where in the heck they're gonna take their final! Most classes during the week (at least one lecture per week) consists of literally going through the homework problems one at a time (hint: these are not the sorts of questions that require this level of review). 
Fairly easy grade by Econ standards...but really this is only an indication of how little this professor cares.

This course is reasonable in its difficulty. There is a moderate amount of material. The math content of the course is very small; anyone with a passing familiarity with algebra should be fine. In fact, if you know calculus, you are going to be frustrated by how naive the math in principles is. But overall, if you read the book, attend recitations, and attend class, you should absorb most of the material.
Lecture itself is amazing; Gulati is a great teacher. He teaches the material with enthusiasm and clarity. The only drawback to lecture is it's time -- he perennially schedules the class at 8:40 am. 
You can only do well in this class if you attend lecture. A fair portion of your grade is unannounced quizzes at 8:40 am sharp. In addition, Gulati's coverage of the material diverges from the text from time to time, so in class notes are a necessity. Do not take this class if you are not going to attend lecture and pay attention; Gulati will chastise students for cell phone use or sleeping and makes everyone answer questions. Conversely, if you do want an engaging lecture, he does not disappoint.

If you are interested in mathematics as a field and have not yet finished the calculus sequence, take this course. It is much more interesting than the alternatives. It has some fun proofs and introduces topics like Fourier series and group theory that you would not see in a calc sequence.
Grading is reasonable, workload on the lighter side. The midterms can be a little unpredictable, but usually fair.
One warning: if you are only interested in calculus and linear algebra as a means to an end, do not take this course. You could certainly get the computational skills you need in the calc sequence instead; in fact, Honors Math is a little light on computations.

There is no excuse not to take this course if you are interested in physics. Actually, there are plenty of excuses, but in the end, I at least found the course worth the effort. Let me get the one potentially off-putting fact out of the way: Homework is at least 8 hours a week. The problems are of varying difficulty, and Cole often times struggles to get the problems published on time. If you take this course, do not wait until the eleventh hour to start your psets. Exams are much easier than the psets, I found the questions reasonable and the curve forgiving.
The material is not terribly difficult once you understand it, but it takes a lot of effort to get to that point. I am leaving this sequence with a much better understanding of physics than I started with. In the first semester, our treatment of special relativity was well motivated and interesting. In the second semester, our exploration of E&M tied in perfectly with relativity and quantum. Actually knowing these physics topics is very rewarding.
Cole is a great teacher; he is truly excited about physics and about teaching you physics. If you are up to the challenge, it would be a shame to miss such an exciting class.

Our classroom discussions were in no way dominated by Prof. Holt, but she made sure to gently steer us in the right direction  when we strayed off topic, and would always bring up something interesting so that there wasn't the awkward silence that often happens in Socratic discussion settings. 
Each book, she would start off our discussion with some background info on the author, novel, and historical context, and she would track down experts to answer any questions we had that she couldn't answer herself.

This professor is a hardass. Like the other reviews say, he has ridiculously long readings, is very vague about his instructions, and generally has sass. But here's the thing, if you are up to the challenge intellectually, he will push you beyond what you thought you were capable of as a student. Especially because this class seeks to problematize and complicate most other branches in political science, it's necessarily very complicated. The papers are difficult, and definitely made me want to cry when I tried to refine my arguments, but Professor Kato is extremely kind if you go office hours and will sit with you until you feel you've reached a point of understanding. He may be come off as mean, but if you prove yourself as a hard worker he genuinely wants to help you succeed. I was tortured when writing each paper, but felt like I sincerely learned something after it was turned in. It does also take a while to figure out exactly what he wants from you in the papers--the book reviews are especially challenging--but if his answers sound vague it's really because he's trying to give you the freedom to structure your paper however you think is best. Just read the examples, and pay attention to the subtleties of his answers.

If you have previous experience in coding, you most likely will not have trouble with this class. If this is your very first exposure to computer science, be forewarned that this is a challenging class. It will be much more rigorous than most likely any other introductory course in other fields. That being said, if you put in the effort, this class is very doable. You will be spending hours studying, as it requires learning both a language (java) and a general science (CS theory). If you do you not intend to be a computer science major, I would suggest taking a different course that involves coding (like a applications course that teaches Python with another subject, or a coding course for nonmajors). If you do take this course, be prepared to do a lot of googling & research on your own to figure out how Java works. It would really help you to do some basic tutorials to get the gist of it before you head into the first lecture. 
Blaer is an excellent professor, and his explanatory style is very clear and concise. He gets very distracted in his lectures, and it's pretty hilarious and adorable--which always made them a pleasure to attend. His expectations for tests and homeworks are always very clear. He does, however, have a tendency to underemphasize how difficult/important topics will be. For example, when listing topics to go over on test, if he mentions something in passing, you should know it pretty much backwards and forwards. Another example, the second to last homework we used a hashmaps, FileReaders, and PrinterWriters--all of which he probably talked about for like two seconds and never explained. 
Additionally, the TAs are beautiful, wonderful human beings. James Lin the head TA/(and I quote) ""aspiring Little League Coach"" is the best thing to happen to 1004 probably ever, and he was very encouraging and generally super kind in all his emails and communications. They are all very helpful, just be sure to find one who you get along with and remember their office hours (there are like a 11 TAs, and like always office hours).

This class was fairly easy; I definitely think it could have gone into more depth. But it was not a joke: it covered a reasonable amount of material in a reasonable amount of depth. Papageorgiou is just an effective teacher, and he doesn't assign cruel problem sets.
The class covers only the basics of quantum computing. It's a CS class but it would be reasonable for a physics major to take it, if they had some very rudimentary CS knowledge (logic circuits, and the general idea of big-O analysis of runtimes). The fact that it was targeted at two groups limited the material we could cover. We couldn't really talk about complexity theory to avoid alienating the physics majors. And we couldn't talk about any actual quantum mechanics or real-world implementations of quantum computers, because that would have terrified the CS majors.
You definitely need to know your linear algebra coming in. The first quarter of the class is basically linear algebra review, to familiarize students with the Dirac notation used in quantum mechanics, and help them get used to working with complex numbers. We then worked through how operations on quantum states can be equivalent to Boolean circuits (proving that quantum computers are at least as powerful as classical computers).
The rest of the class was going over the famous quantum algorithms that are better than any known classical algorithm. Shor's factoring algorithm, which is the cool thing that everyone wants to learn, didn't really come in until the last few weeks of class (although much of the groundwork was laid before that).
Lectures were basically the professor working through problems on a digital board and explaining as he went. It was important to take good notes, because for some reason he would not post copies of these digital notes online. His lectures were quite helpful; they followed the general structure of the textbook but made explicit some parts of the book left ""as an exercise to the reader"". Normally I think this format is terrible, but there was something mysterious going on and I actually remembered most of what I learned. Perhaps it was the professor's mellifluous accent.
The professor and TA were both helpful and available during office hours. They were also both responsive by email, and generally very friendly in all their interactions.
Overall, this is a great class. I didn't have to work that hard and I still learned a ton. It's the best of all possible worlds.

Homework was not too time-consuming. There were simple but helpful written problems. Most assignments also required us to write a ""simulation"" of some quantum algorithm in MATLAB. These were totally useless: often you would pass in the desired answers as an argument to the function. But it was surprising how helpful it was to my understanding to write them.
2 completely open-book exams (which includes any notes you want and even a laptop, for those students who pirate their textbooks).
The exams had very high averages. If you asked a clarifying question during the exam, the professor was extremely generous with his answers; he wouldn't be coy if a mistake had led you astray.

Read some mixed reviews of Prof. Lewis for her Intro to Philosophy course. Decided to take Intro to Logic with her. Huge mistake. This must have been her first time teaching Intro to Logic and it showed. She wasn't confident in the material at all. There were times when she froze up trying to answer questions in a way that had the whole class cringing. The material is easy at first so you're able to get through her poorly made and confusing lectures without any consequence but after the first test it gets significantly harder. She plodded through an ocean of confused faces and delivered her powerpoint presentations just the same. Don't take this class with her unless you are naturally gifted at understanding math.

Professor Marka is the shit. If you're not a science person (which is who the class is obviously designed for) you will probably feel pretty lost the first few lectures. After a while you start getting some of the stuff and if you're interested you can learn a lot. If you're busy you can skip class and not miss a beat. 
Watching Professor Marka is the real pleasure. It's like someone gave a curious child unlimited resources and encouraged him to play with all the dangerous things in the lab. He gleefully handles liquid nitrogen and harasses his TA by being casually brilliant. He also speaks in a hilariously villainous German accent which can be a little hard to understand but makes the class that much more of a good time.  Professor Marka is a world class scientist who specializes in Black Holes and other mysterious shit. Get him to explain it all to you and take this class for an fun and easy way to knock out your science requirement. 
TL;DR Professor Marka is the man. Class is Easy A. Very little work.

I thoroughly enjoyed my time in David Adamcyk's section of Music Hum, despite the fact that it was an 8:40 am class. I think he gave a solid overview of music from the Western tradition at a good pace, while managing to cover many contemporary music concepts. 
He has a separate website for his Music Hum class, which is super helpful and contains the lesson plan for each day, links to supplementary listening/concert venues/terms, and information about papers and exams. Each day, one student is assigned to pick any kind of music to present during the first five minutes of class; this is fun because it relaxes the atmosphere and you learn a bit more about your classmates. The class explicitly follows this schedule and we covered everything from Medieval music (Hildegaard von Bingen, Palestrina) to Minimalism (Reich, Cage, Glass) and Jazz. Of course, the most famous classical music composers such as Haydn, Brahms, Mozart, and Bach, are covered. He was very patient in going over key terms and material, and even as a student who has had extensive training in classical music, I found the course very illuminating when we learned about technology's role in music (think Moog synthesizers, multi-track recording process).
At first, I was intimidated to take this section of Music Hum when I learned he was a composer. I suppose I had some warped perception that composers would be harsher in terms of hearing students' opinions about music, but (at least in this case) I was wrong. David was very receptive to student opinions and will kindly give you his feedback on your ideas without being intimidating. 
The concert reports were graded leniently and the midterm and final were straight out of class notes. I wouldn't bother buying the recommended book; there's an online version of it out there, anyway, and if you take good notes, you won't need it. 
I highly recommend this section. I regret not meeting with him one-on-one, which was due in part to the fact that he only has office hours by appointment, but I think many of my classmates found talking to him about their concert reports super helpful. Once I got to know David a little better at the end of semester, I found him pretty hilarious and charmingly quirky.

I feel kinda bad writing a harsh review because Papageorgiou is a really nice guy and cares a lot. He's the professor who looks over your shoulder while you're taking the midterm and tells you where you've made a mistake. (This boosted my score by at least 10 points.) He's the professor who absolutely glows when people do well on the homework. When he says his door is open, he _means_ it. Really means it.
So I'm not going to shit on him because I don't like him. Or because my grade will probably suck, because that's my fault for losing interest and not doing the work past March or so. I'm going to shit on him because despite what a wonderful person he is, his teaching has thoroughly earned it. Before I launch into that, though, here's my recommendation if you want to learn about quantum computing: read Scott Aaronson's book, ""Quantum Computing Since Democritus"". I bought it and chipped away at it half-heartedly for a few days in February and it taught me more and explained things better than Papageorgiou did in a whole semester.
Ok, now that we've got preliminaries out of the way:
The class really is as close to an out-and-out waste of time as I've had at Columbia. Each lecture starts with a 10-30 minute review of the previous lecture (generally closer to 10 minutes, but 30 happened a few times), so you're getting maybe 2/3 of a lecture. And then during that 2/3 of a lecture, the class covers very little material. For a sense of how little: it would be generous to say we covered 1.5 chapters of the textbook during the second half of the semester. And we only managed that by skipping all the tough material and glossing over the particulars of a lot of the easier material.
Just to be clear, this isn't an ""easy"" class the way some with little content are. There's just a lot of time dedicated to intense study of trivia. A personal pet peeve: an inordinate amount of time was spent on how single qubit quantum gates can be decomposed into rotations. The textbook devotes maybe 10 lines to this, tucked away as a side note in the end-of-section exercises of an introductory chapter, but we dedicated many hours in class to example after example of this decomposition. One of the five questions on the final was decomposing a single qubit gate into rotations. And it came up during the final review. And on the quiz before the midterm. Papageorgiou kept coming back to it, guessing his way through the decomposition, explaining how he intuited every step, filling the whiteboard up top to bottom... all for a decomposition that can be solved quickly and directly by the algebraic substitution techniques you learned in middle school.
While that's an extreme case, it's gives a sense of how the class worked and why we got almost nothing done. Papageorgiou can't seem to explain the ""big picture"" -- he drills down into particulars very quickly, and gets lost in them. There are professors who, at the beginning of a lecture, can tell you what you will learn today and what its place is in the course. Papageorgious can only do the former. As a result, at the end of the semester, the material you know is a fair  approximation to what you might know if you lifted 30 random paragraphs out of the first 4 chapters of the textbook and then studied each intensively for an hour. You'd know plenty of factoids but have little grasp of how they fit together. My working hypothesis: Papageorgiou never sat down and worked out a theory of what this class is supposed to be.
Again, an example, which I think is representative: a physics major in our class was confused by the proof that sets of quantum gates are universal. He objected that the proof didn't address the efficiency of constructing an arbitrary gate from the universal set. Flustered, Papageorgiou brushed this off, saying roughly ""In quantum computing, we don't care about efficiency!"" That might make sense if there weren't so much fuss about the efficiency of Shor's and Grover's algorithms. The ""big picture"" explanation that was never forthcoming: quantum computing, like the deterministic variety, happened as a progression from proofs of computability (in this case, universality of gates) to proofs of efficient algorithms for specific problems (e.g. Shor) to...
Ah. Another sore point. We never got the next step, ""proofs that quantum computing algorithms form families,"" the quantum complexity classes. The book, which is 15 years old, barely knows quantum complexity classes exist. But they do, and what I've read about them on my own (e.g. Aaronson's book, Wikipedia) is really really cool, and it was very disappointing and frustrating to go through a whole semester and not (as far as I can recall) hear BQP mentioned even once.
Ok, I'm going to stop now because you've probably gotten the point. :P

5 homeworks, not very hard but sometimes tedious. Make sure you know your linear algebra. Each has a programming component to be done in MATLAB. Again, not hard but usually tedious.
Two quizzes (one each before the midterm and final) that give you bonus points towards the exam grades. Midterm and final that are open everything -- no joke, you can use your iPhone if you want -- and are really just regurgitation for the most part. Like the gate decomposition thing, or ""derive an algorithm to do X,"" where X is almost verbatim the description of some algorithm we covered in lecture and because the exam is open book you can just copy it out of the book. It is advisable to go to the midterm and final review sessions because *hint hint* the actual questions MIGHT be used as review examples, or simply given away outright by Papageorgiou. (I learned this the hard way.)

I love mythology in general and entered this class very familiar with the material, and with an very deep respect for Professor Foley as the foremost expert on The Hymn to Demeter. However, although she is a very nice teacher and clearly cares an immense amount about the material, her lecture style can be very dull. She spends every class going through slides of artistic representations of whatever that day's myth is, but I can't remember a single time she actually brought up more than one critically backed interpretation. Also since it's easy to gather the general gist of the myths from the slides without reading them, lots of students just wouldn't do the reading (also in part because there is a ton of it). I was lucky because I happen to love this stuff, so the reading wasn't a problem for me, but this is not a good class if you just want to fulfill your lit requirement. 
Oh, and the midterm and the final aren't as hard as they seem like they will be. If you're familiar with the common identifying features of all the gods in greek and roman art you will be fine; you don't have to memorize all of the slides she shows you. 
She also puts together these really interesting packets of poems related to each myth (some modern, some classic). It's hard to find the time to read them during the semester, but I'd strongly recommend downloading them to read later. They really are quite good.

Professor Gulotta is awful. He seems like a well-intentioned guy, and he's very knowledgeable about the material (he's a grad student but actually already has a PhD in a related field), but he has the worst teaching style of anyone I have ever had. He spends all class writing the proofs form the book on the blackboard, and frequently would go the entire time with hardly two glances at the class. He has one of those droning voices that is just impossible to focus on too. The first day of class five of the sixteen people got up and left while he was lecturing, walking right past him, and he didn't even seem to notice. After a few weeks I approached him and told him I wouldn't be attending lectures anymore, and apologized saying that I just wasn't used to his teaching style and I hoped he wouldn't take it personally. His response was, ""it's okay, a lot of students make that choice."" 
His tests are killer. I got two low Fs and a D (which has never happened to me before, because I usually enjoy math and don't mind studying), but because of the curve those came out to A-, B+, and a B. The homework is incredibly challenging but very helpful, and if you can do it you will probably (with the curve) do fine on his tests. But before it comes to that I'd recommend just switching out. Ask any of the math tutors or other grad students, they'll tell you the same (and so they told me, when I finally came to them for help a month into the course, when it was too late).

Neath is a satisfactory instructor. His classes are standard lectures in which he writes notes on the board and occasionally asks questions directed to the class.

If you have the opportunity to take this course with Professor Collins, I strongly recommend you do so. 
The lectures are very interesting and, when time allows, he will permit the student's questions to drive the conversation, often for the betterment of the class. The only time when time will not be an issue is when Professor Collins recalls a witty story or a philosophy joke, and will undoubtably end up telling it. Although the stories and jokes may end with silence, his lectures are, more often than not, very funny. As stated in the previous post, you will see No! on your returned papers, at least if you write philosophy papers of the same poor quality as I do, but the grading is fair. 
If you are new to philosophy, as I was, do not expect an easy transition into the subject, the first topic was time travel. If you have never experienced an extreme level of confusion, so extreme that you may be convinced you have just suffered a stroke, you will when you read a philosopher's explanation of time travel. You will also never be able to enjoy Back to the Future ever, ever, again.

Yang Feng is a pretty good instructor. His classes are standard lectures in which he makes use of PowerPoint slides for each chapter (they are posted on his website) and the chalkboard for extra clarification. Since this class requires R, he demonstrates some code in class as well (the R code is provided on his website too).
I found the PowerPoint slides to be quite helpful at times. At worst, they just copy the material from the book. However, the slides contain what you need to know in each chapter.
All of the problem sets require R, so it's a good idea to download RStudio to play around with R. Fortunately, all the code required for the class is demonstrated in class, so you could reuse the code he provides on the website to complete assignments. 
It's important to review your linear algebra (matrices, eigenvalues, transpose) for this class. The second half of the class requires linear algebra. It's also not a bad idea to pick up a little R beforehand (just to make your time easier).
Overall, a decent instructor. Fairly nice guy too.

(Jennifer Rudd goes by Annie Rudd in class)
Annie is an amazing instructor. She knows the material very well and presents it very clearly in class. She also finds many ways to relate the material to current events or the media by showing relevant video clips. She is also very good at facilitating class discussions and asking the right questions.
Annie also provides very comprehensive and detailed notes for review before the midterm and the final exam. There are no surprises on the exams and everything is extremely straightforward.
She also cares a lot about the students. She arranged a few outings for the class and even an end-of-the-semester picnic. 
Overall, if you get Annie Rudd, take the class!
Also, no laptops in class (except for review sessions).
Workload:
Participation - make sure you participate in class.
Presentations - started in the spring semester. Each person has to present a brief biography on an author/work (chosen by the student) and provide a few questions about the text for discussion.
Courseworks posts - required once every week (except on a week when an essay is due). 250-500 words. The posts are responses to suggested prompts for the week's readings.
Essays - There are two, each about 6-8 pages long. There are a few prompts provided, plus an option to write about something else that must be approved in advance. You usually have about two weeks to finish an essay.
Midterm - Concept identification (requires one to identify the text in which the concept arises and discuss its significance), short passage analysis (analyzing a short excerpt from one of the texts), and an essay portion (with provided prompts). There are multiple options for each part, so you can pick and choose which concepts, passages, or essay prompts to address (for example, choose two out of the five concepts to discuss).
Usually in-class, although the midterm in the spring was take-home because Annie was sick.

Let me preface this by saying I switched from 1601 first semester to 1402 second semester. This class was a let down in comparison to 1601. Dodd(the Physics 1601/1602 teacher) was the absolute best! He really cared about his students and makes an effort to learn and remember your name if you go to office hours. So if you do have some physics background and you're stuck between 1601 and 1401 from the get go, I'd say choose 1601. It's a lot of work (graded online PSET every week), but if you go to office hours Dodd helps you out. Now that I'm done gushing over Dodd...
Hughes is an Okay teacher. His teaching style is basically giving you the formulas and rules on the board and going through some examples. This is good preparation for the exams which is 20 free response questions, each worth 5 points. If you go over notes, do the practice exams, and do the homework, you should do fine. Since I had some physics background, his lack of in detail explanation was ok, but I could see how someone without any physics background might not fully understand and may need to put in a lot more work. I never went to his office hours so  I don't know if he was helpful. 
He broke his hip towards the end of the semester, so he was unable to walk around and do problem examples on the board. His teaching turned into him sending us the lecture notes via email before class and then reading from those lecture notes during class. The lecture notes were literally just formulas, no examples. Going to lecture became useless and at least 60% of the class stopped showing up after that. 
If could do it over again, I would have stayed in Dodd's class. The weekly PSETs made me stay on top of the class. And because some of the problems were really hard, I went to office hours, which definitely helped with homework and with understanding the material in general. 
But if you feel you can stay on top of the material yourself, then choose Hughes. It's less work.

It's very rare to find a professor that genuinely cares about their students, but Dan Rubenstein is one of them. He might not be the best lecturer I've ever had (more specifics on that later), but he is undoubtedly one of the most helpful and caring professors I've had at Columbia.
LECTURES:
Like I said, objectively speaking, Rubenstein isn't the best lecturer I've had, but by no means is he a ""bad"" lecturer. Really, his biggest problem is that he needs to ditch the slides a bit. Instead of going through examples on a powerpoint, he'd be better off going through them on the board. It can get messy that way (with all the circuits and whatnot), but to combat that he could just post the examples on courseworks for reference. The occasional times he did problems on the board, I found them to make so much more sense than following along with the slides, and that's because, at the end of the day, he's actually good at explaining concepts in the course. With that said, see the Office Hours section for why you should go to them because they are/were super helpful. 
To elaborate more on him as a lecturer, he does NOT read straight from the slides. He glances at them before speaking to remind himself what's on the slide, but he doesn't read straight from them. In fact, I think he blatantly avoids doing so because he knows that wouldn't be very helpful. 
Also, his analogies and stories are not only hilarious, but make the classes/material memorable. Anyone who doesn't enjoy these bits of class seriously has no sense of humor. 
He does explain concepts too many times- I know it's because people don't get them the first or even second time around, but hearing the same concept did get tedious sometimes.
Also, people complain so much about the occasional mistakes he makes on a slide, but really, I think we just need to relax a bit and recognize that he is a human being. We make mistakes. 
HOMEWORKS:
Difficult and long, but super important for doing well in the class- not because they're worth so much of your grade, but because they're really important for gaining a good grasp of the material. Rubenstein is very purposeful in the questions he chooses, so really understanding each one is important.
I will say though- the MIPS assignment was somewhat unreasonably hard, though graded extremely generously. I liked learning MIPS in the beginning, but I think holding off this hardcore assignment more towards to the last third of the semester would have served us better. I feel like most people didn't get as much as they could've from the assignment because it was just too soon to be given that hard of an assignment.
MIDTERM:
Super hard. It was a huge time crunch- I didn't even get to read the last question (of 4) or truly attempt the third question, which means I essentially left half the test blank. And I wasn't a rare occurrence. With that said, the average ended up being a 42, so it all worked out in the end, I suppose~ 
His tests are super hard, but they do drive us to really have to know the material. He warned us at the beginning that he tests this way to really get whether or not we understand the material. If you understand it and can apply it, then you'll be fine. 
FINAL:
Easier than the midterm- the average was a 62 and it was very reasonable. It wasn't technically cumulative (but the material builds on itself, so it sort of is at the same time). 
OFFICE HOURS: 
His office hours are great, and if you can make them, you should make every effort to do so. Every time I went to office hours, it was a valuable experience and he's so willing to go through anything you don't understand at whatever pace you need. His office hours get a bit busy around the time homeworks are due (still totally useful though because people ask good questions, which I always learned from, too), but going to his office hours when there's maybe one other person or no one else is great because you'll get his full attention. This is good advice for pretty much all professors, but unlike a lot of people/professors, he won't make you feel dumb if you don't know something - even if it's a simple concept. Don't be afraid to go- he's seriously such a nice guy. He might come off as intimidating at first, but he really is a nice person and at the end of the day, just cares that his students learn the material. 
The only problem was that he had his office hours in the same class sequence at the same time (i.e. Tuesday/Thursday from 11am-12pm), which made it really hard/impossible to make office hours if you have a class during a portion of that time. I had a 10:10 and an 11:40, but if the 10:10 hadn't ended early lots of times or I didn't accidentally sleep through it occasionally, I would have never been able to make his office hours, so if you're in his class, really try to get him to not have office hours in the same class sequence.
TIPS:
1. Goes without saying, go to his office hours. Not only useful, but he apparently takes office hour appearance into consideration when grading at the end.
2. He's a chill professor- get to know him. Also, he does research on networks and that's pretty cool. 
3. Skim the textbooks if you want, but don't read them religiously because Rubenstein does a good enough job that you don't need to read the textbook. If you want to read them though, they're actually not too bad of a read.  
4. Do his practice midterm/final problems!
5. Go to class. Seriously, you pay/get financial aid to go here and Rubenstein is both good and entertaining. Why skip if you don't have to?
THE FINAL WORD:
Students tend to have a preference for Martha Kim's version of the class, but I think a large portion of that is because her class is easier (And that is the attributed reason at least half the time)- she doesn't go into the material as in-depth (at least according to the lectures, which I've looked through), so the tests and homeworks are much easier (I've gone through them for practice). So with that said, if you're looking for the easier class, then sure, take Fundamentals in the fall with Martha Kim (she is also very nice and a good lecturer as well), but if you're looking for the class that will make you/cause you to learn more and know the material a lot better, then Rubenstein's your bet. He'll challenge you and you'll hate him temporarily when you're coding his MIPS assignment at 3 in the morning, but at the end, you'll have gained so much knowledge that you'll realize it was worth the struggle.
With that said, I had a great class experience with him, especially because I appreciate professors whose main goal is to challenge and have us learn and is willing to go the extra mile to make that happen.

Workload:
Not necessarily heavy, just difficult. We had 8 assignments, each of which varied in length of completion time. It kind of depends on what you're strength/major(s) are. For me, a CS major, the material in the beginning that was very circuitry heavy was the hardest since I just didn't think that way at the time, so depending on which major/background you're coming from is what will come easiest/hardest to you and which assignments you'll spend the most time on.

PROS: 
1. The professor is knowledgeable and cool.
2. She is enthusiastic about teaching and cares a lot about her students.
3. The material is interesting.
CONS:
1. She refuses to post the lecture slides and is very adamant about not posting them. To make this worse, she would often change the slides too quickly. I spent the majority of my time and concentration trying to copy the notes rather than listening to what she was saying.
2. She is misleading about the difficulty of the tests. What she claimed to be a straightforward take-home midterm that would take ""6 hours at most"" took the vast majority of the class 2 days to finish and was highly detailed, complicated, and tedious (some people did very well, some people struggled). Furthermore, a good number of the multiple choice questions on the final exam were weirdly worded and tricky/detailed. (You must do all the readings and memorize the lecture notes.) 
3. The group project was time-consuming and annoying sometimes. You know the deal: someone is always slacking off, it's almost impossible to find a time that's good for everyone, there is one person doing all the work, etc. She made us sign a group contract, but it was completely useless. Oh, and you have to make a poster, do mini-presentations for your classmates, and write a single-spaced 7-page paper with your group. The only upside to the group work was that it forced us to interact with our classmates.
It was a good class but some parts were very annoying. Be prepared to put in the work and time taking lots of notes and doing the readings.

Words cannot express the stultifying sense of ennui that weighs you down each down you sit down for Kaye's lecture. If you take this class, you should expect to be bored witless. This course should be re-titled The Papacy until 1450, as most of the course focuses on the popes and the development of the Church. Most of the interesting history is excised in favor of church teachings and the development of law. In theory, the workload isn't too bad, but the boredom makes it worse. The teacher expected and graded you on your knowledge of the secondary sources for his exams. so if you unfortunately sign up for this class, you should make the effort to read the 2 or 3 articles he assigns each week and get a general sense of the argument and details. The grading is skewed towards the exams because he only assigns one paper.

Linda Bartholomai's personality is awfully abrasive and aloof. It was really uncomfortable to have her as a facilitator in class discussion in particular conversations about race, class, sexuality and other social identities. Though she particularly said at the beginning of class, I can only accept 30 out of 70 people in the room and I take into consideration diversity.... In class discussions, she was actually quite racist. She presented herself as THE authoritative judgment call on the plays we watched instead of allowing for disagreement in class, saying things like: ""Nooooo I really don't think that was the playwright's intention."" ""I didn't think the stereotypically gay character was offensive.""  It all culminated in a conversation about race-specific vs color-blind casting, which became a cringing experience when two black girls in the class were forced to go against the the class and teacher's opinion. Her feedback on papers was minimal and often dismissive. I didn't feel like I was getting better at my theater reviews or more astute at watching theater.  Grades were pretty arbitrary. I never knew why I got a 90 or a 95. In fact I got 90s and 95s on every single play review, 90 on the  midterm and then got an 85 on the final and somehow that became a B+... Her selection of plays was ok though we could have been spared the awful children's theater at the beginning. All that said, she seems like she is just like every other jaded working theater professional who honestly doesn't get paid enough to do this but like wow...

Here's the deal: this is not, in any way, an introductory course to Roman history. In that context this is a horrible, awful course. But if you already know Roman history this class would probably be enjoyable.
Prof. Harris: as a person, good. As a professor: atrocious. I do not say this because he rambles, and drones on endlessly. That could be acceptable in some cases. But he conveys absolutely no useful information in his lectures. His lectures are and hour and a half of him nitpicking whether this publisher of Roman history or that publisher of Roman history meets his expectations, and whether this writer or that was as exacting as they should have been. Newsflash: I DON'T CARE. I came here for a Roman history course, not to hear someone's very personal opinions on the state of Roman historiography in contemporary times. It was wildly inappropriate. And in the end the class was a complete waste of time. Every single person I spoke with hated it, even alumni, but the history department is obviously not going to do anything about it. They're idiots. 
Professor Harris is funny and likable. But this course serves no purpose. Half the class stopped showing up a week or two in and just watched Roman documentaries because even the books weren't very good. But again, to be sure: you will get nothing from Harris' lectures. Nothing.

This is a decent class where you will be challenged, put up with lousy instruction but learn a good deal in the process. Daniel Hsu is a super smart professor but about as engaging as a piece of wood. He knows the material in and out and leave you with an appreciation for ML by the end. The class runs pretty smoothly from an operational perspective. The response time on Piazza is insane - Daniel gets back to you in a few hours, especially right before HW deadlines and exams. His answers aren't generally helpful. You see a lot of monosyllabic ""No""s as answers and he will put you down if your question is stupid or poorly worded (thank god for anonymity). However, when he does deem your question worthy, you get a thorough response.
The course assumes you have a decent background in calculus, statistics and linear algebra. Daniel does not pull any punches on the math. If you've taken Calc III, Linear Algebra and Intro to Probability and Stats, you should be fine. You have to be familiar with some matrix calculus, basic probability and stats (multivariate Gaussians, expectations, Baye's rule), projections, eigenvectors and SVD from linear algebra.
Daniel focuses a lot on a lot of theory in machine learning and less on practice. Lots of long proofs and details on the math behind classification models. I personally think this is excellent since ML is inherently a very mathematical subject and understanding it at this level is key. We covered MLE, generative models, decision tress, linear classifiers, perceptrons, SVM, kernels, some ML theory, boosting, regression, PCA, clustering, entropy, HMMs and some math behind a lot of these topics in detail in their own dedicated lectures. Lots of good stuff!
It was impossible to stay awake in class since he turned off the lights in 501 NoCo and is a pretty boring lecturer. He doesn't engage with students unless someone asks a question. Thankfully, his slides are great and available online. I encourage you to try to pay attention in class because sometimes the slides are hard to understand on your own right before the exam at the last minute.
The homeworks were reasonable and consisted of a mix of theory and programming questions. They were challenging but nothing you couldn't do by spending some time pouring over the slides and going to office hours. Some of the theory questions were hard and it took my hours reading lecture notes or going to office hours to figure them out. The programming part tends to be simple but you have to vectorize your code for it to take minutes not hours, which can be a bit tricky. Assuming you don't pay attention in lecture (because it's really hard to) and that you have to read the slides from scratch to solve the HW, it takes 8+ hours of work on average. TAs were not helpful since they often couldn't solve the homework themselves.
His exams are impossible. Numerical grading on tests and homeworks was very generous and countered the difficulty of the exams. However, his letter grade assignments are on the harsh side.
I heard StatML with Cunningham is fantastic. He's a great lecturer and focuses on intuition. If you want a more practical course, I would suggest that. If you're a CS major in the Foundations or AI tracks and need ML to count towards your track requirements, you're out of luck. Daniel's class is not bad and I would take it again even though it was a little painful.

Hands down the best class I've taken at Columbia. It's a one week intensive class that takes 16+ hours a day for 3 credits over winter break. You form a team in the Fall semester and apply online. If selected, you get to do customer development for your business idea, build an MVP, have to talk to over a 100 people and iterate on your business model canvas. Hopefully at the end of this you have a possible startup idea that has validated initial hypotheses. This class will challenge you but also teach you how to go about starting a business.
Don't take this class unless you're 100% interested in entrepreneurship and starting a company. It's a waste of your time and everyone else's time too! Useless team mates were a liability.

The negative reviews on Professor O'Flaherty are a bit exaggerated. It's true that he talks about the children aka the cats a lot and words the problem sets/exams in vague ways that can require online searching because we did not cover it class. He uses Piazza to clear up wording, but doesn't always actually bridge the gap and requires you to go to TA's office hours to make sure you ace the problem sets. I scored on the average for the first midterm mostly because I couldn't understand what was being asked of the question. Luckily the second midterm and final were made into take home exams and actually helped me in learning a lot trying to answer them because it become a research project about interesting Economic topics like the Water-Diamond Paradox. Just another thing that was not covered in class but I was fortunate enough to stumble upon online. On the positive he send the class weekly email blasts about what will be covered in class, recitation, and weekly times articles that are on current events regarding the upcoming lesson plans. He brings a good sense of humor to class and if you sit up front you can get some good dialogue with him to clear up things. This kid Salim sat up front and wouldn't stop raising his hand to asks questions. Although sometimes annoying he did ask some good questions and make some of the more boring lectures a bit less of a snore fest. Overall, the class was enjoyable and didn't hurt my GPA like I heard Gulatti would, nor was it hard to understand because of a thick accent like other Econ professors.

I was so excited for this class but all that ever happened was Mendelson reading out loud some of the assigned poems and rephrasing what is going on and I battling to stay awake. He also made it clear in class that he doesn't care about what students write in the course evaluations. So be warned, it is a boring class where he doesn't interpret the poems and instead, along with the TAs, grades the papers harshly if you interpret the poems yourself. You have to write the papers as he insists. It is not a college course with any intellectual discussion going on in the class. I would not recommend it to my friends so you take heed!

I'm writing a review on this course as of 2015 in order to counter-balance the overwhelmingly negative comment found below.
(1) The syllabus has been updated. I found most of the readings interesting and informative. The required weekly reading is no heavier than Betts' WPS (in fact, it's probably considerably lighter).
(2) Be prepared for the fact that some lectures will be better than others. The Egypt and Turkey discussions did feel ""pundit-y"" and repetitive as the previous review said. In these weeks, you will learn a lot more from the readings than you do in class. On the other hand, the lectures on Israel, Palestine, and the peace process were awesome. 
(3) Freilich isn't condescending or harsh. And I actually found him to be very willing to engage with the class. But he will call you out if you say something that is irrelevant or factually wrong (ie Yemen has a relatively high GDP). If you can't deal with a class where you will sometimes be wrong, then don't take this course.
(4) The exams are really not that hard. Although I do say this as someone who did nearly all of the reading. But again, is that really that unreasonable of a requirement for a graduate level politics course? I think not.
Bottom line: This isn't the best course that I've taken at Columbia. But it is also far from the worst.

Take this class. Now.
Professor James Curley is an intelligent, knowledgeable, and effective instructor who always does his best to make his lectures interesting with videos and interesting facts. The material itself is also very interesting.
He seems like a really cool guy and genuinely wants the class to do well, and I felt his exams were extremely fair and straightforward (all the questions are short answer, though). He is not out to get you or trick you on the exams whatsoever; he literally just wants to know if you know the material he presented to you. The exams are not difficult if you study. Like I said, he is very fair.

Beyond the complaints we've seen about how Vincent Racaniello's class being too easy, it's very much worth taking this class because the man is one hell of an educator. It's clear that he does it because he just wants to share his love of his study to the world, and his passion for the subject really rubs off on you and makes the course a pleasure to take- especially considering that there are a few requisite boring patches during the semester.
This being said, I think the takeaway from this semester is that Racaniello isn't f'ing around anymore with his curve. Either due to rumored departmental pressure, or because of rude buttheads like the 2014 reviewer, he has made getting an A range grade something of a challenge. Averages on exams fell consistently in the mid 70s, and he curved the overall mean grade (mid 80s- 84 I think?) to a straight B. The hard A cutoff was a 94, and A- started at 89. Our midterm exams were slightly harder than the exams used in previous years because he started testing finer details. Our final was notably less pleasant to write than the 2014 final because he shifted to the paragraph-question testing style that most of the upper level Columbia bio department seems to like. (In fact, the 2014 final was widely considered a joke compared to our final). I will leave the editorializing for others, but I don't really think that he will get a lot of complaints about course difficulty from here on out. 
The thing about Virology is that the course material that you can introduce in an undergraduate class really isn't hard. The first half of the course is essentially variations on the central dogma, and then the second half focuses more on macro level: infection, spread, and application of virology principles.
Racaniello, I think, has made a conscious decision to cover the study in broader strokes, so you won't be able to get as much detail in some of the subjects he covers. This is as opposed to other upper level Columbia bio classes, that perhaps will spend a lot more time on the particular cascades and mechanisms of one specific physiological phenomenon through a research paper, but not be able to cover as many general principles. This is neither good nor bad- it's how he decided to teach the course. The practical outcome of this decision though, is that the margin of error you are allowed, especially with his new curve, is slimmer. He provides study questions to accompany every exam, and studying those is pretty helpful because they cover what he considers good takeaways from the courses. Many of the principles on the study questions showed up on exams.
I believe that a good comparison in terms of course difficulty is Stockwell's Biochemistry lecture. None of the stuff tested is exceedingly challenging, but the grade cutoffs ensure a distribution of final grades that keeps you honest in terms of the course work.
I think that it really gives Racaniello no joy to do this, because he just wants to teach.
As a result, he gave the class a bonus question that could increase your final average by 2% maximum, which was pretty nice, but I also believe was sorely needed considered how poorly people were doing on the midterms (likely due to underestimating his course.)
Overall, this course is very much worth taking. Racaniello is a great teacher and very likeable. But do not underestimate his course anymore. You need to actually work to get an A.

2 midterms & 1 final, all worth 30%.

Professor Emir is awful. I am writing this having (unfortunately, because of requirements) taken two classes with him in the last two semesters. I attended every class both semesters and did well both times (at least from the grades I have so far of Applied Data Mining), so while many people are critical of their professors when they do badly and/or never show up to class - I was there the whole time and really know how bad he is. The only way I was able to do well in these classes was by spending excessive time reading and re-reading the textbook and other materials I found online and going to office hours as often as I possibly could. I learned absolutely nothing from Professor Emir.
He comes unprepared to class. Yes, there are lecture slides that he has to pull up on the screen, but he does not prepare any of these himself. The slides consist of either screenshots of the textbook pdf and entire lectures using slides he found online (I've found them online too). When he goes through the lecture slides during class, it is often clear that going through them during class time is the first time he has ever looked at them (because whatever he has on the slides doesn't even make sense to him).
For Applied Data Mining, he never graded the midterm. It was a 5-hour take-home on the Thursday after Spring Break (March 26). I am writing this on May 16, after all our final exams are over, about 7.5 weeks after we took the midterms - we still haven't gotten our midterms graded (and, he did originally say that he would email us individually with comments on the midterms. So that is clearly not happening). Also, 3 or 4 weeks after we took the midterm, a number of students asked him when we'd be getting feedback on the exams. He did not give us a clear answer, and he said he ""did not have time"" to even begin grading them yet. The TA also said during her office hours that he had not asked her or the grader for any assistance grading the midterms.
He simply does not respond to emails. Actually, he apparently responds selectively to some students and not to others. This has been especially problematic since his instructions for the homeworks and the take-home final have consistently been unclear.
On at least one occasion, during his office hours (8-8:40am before class and he is often not there or makes personal phone calls) he realized a mistake he made in the assignment he had written. He told just the students who were present during office hours that we could skip the part of the assignment that he had written by mistake, and neglected to tell the rest of the class until the morning it was due, when in fact he had realized this mistake 3 days before. By then, most of the class (except for the 3 or 4 of us who were there during office hours) had spent hours trying to figure out the part of the homework that made no sense to begin with. 
The day he assigned the take-home final exam/project (Applied Data Mining), he showed up to class unprepared (no lecture slides), so he opened up a blank word document, and wrote out what our final would consist of. Before then, he had clearly put no thought into it at all. If I'm not mistaken, writing out assignments is something professors should do before they show up to class - not during class, without any previous thought put into it. Because of the lack of thought that he put into writing this assignment, the instructions were unclear, required that we do an excessive amount of work that we had never even seen before -- and again, because he doesn't respond to emails, an assignment that shouldn't have been so bad at all took an insane amount of time.
In Applied Linear Regression Analysis, we had a group project that was assigned at the beginning of the semester - and it was supposed to be a semester-long project. However, Professor Emir continued to change the instructions until just a few days before it was due.
If for whatever reason Professor Emir is asked to teach another class at Columbia and you have to take it, just be prepared to learn everything on your own. He is not there to teach you or support you learn.

He clearly puts so much time into preparing for each lecture, and is also extremely helpful when it comes to answering questions.

If you're in the Foundations track, you should definitely take this class. The course covers approximation algorithms often touching upon some state of the art stuff in the field. It's quite an intellectually challenging with plenty of opportunity to really dive in depth into the subject matter if you choose. There were a surprising number of undergrads (at least 6 out of 35) for a 6000 level class so you'll have plenty of company.
Yannakakis is not the most exciting lecturer but an expert in the field and as such can answer any question you throw at him. The class was 2 hours long so it was often hard to concentrate for the entire duration. If you get lost at any one point in time, you're pretty much screwed for the rest of the class since it all builds up.
Each class generally consisted of us studying a specific problem and different techniques to design approximation algorithms. A lot of the material can be found in the textbook Approximation Algorithms by Vazirani. It would be useful to brush up on common problems like max-cut, flows, TSP, etc. to get the most out of the class.
Homeworks were generally difficult and required some time and deep thinking. I worked with a friend and it took us maybe 10-15 hours on average + attending office hours where one of the TAs would pretty much go over the gist of the solution (which was very much appreciated). 
You have to write a 15 page research paper on any topic of your choice within the scope of the class. He gives you a month for it and I suggest you start early. I put together a pathetic excuse for a paper 3 days before it was due and was not happy with the results or my understanding of the problem I was studying.

This was definitely one of the best classes I’ve taken at Columbia.  Paul Siegel put incredible amounts of effort and enthusiasm into teaching this course and this played no small part in making the course such great experience.  
Professor Siegel is an excellent lecturer who presents the material at a reasonable pace with high levels of enthusiasm in addition to a good amount of involving the class.  He’s very organized also does a great job answering questions without getting sidetracked.  While the material can be very dense, he does a great job keeping a relatively light tone with humor and interesting asides.  
Additionally, he typed lecture notes that paralleled the lectures for the entire course, and these were extremely helpful.  They totaled to about 50 very dense pages by the end of the semester.  As the previous review mentioned, the material was related chapters 1-5 and chapter 8 of Munkres, but he also added several topics and examples of his own choice that were not in the textbook which greatly enriched the course.  It was clear that the put so much thought into what he covered into this class, which was a refreshing departure from professors who essentially read from the assigned textbook during lectures.  
The same creativity extended to the choice of homework problems, but this often meant that the homework assignments could be very difficult.  He definitely went out of his way to choose interesting and relevant problems, and many of these were great.  At times he was a bit too ambitious, but he acknowledged this after the fact and made adjustments for future homework assignments.  He also wrote great solutions for all of the homework assignments. 
The exams were very straightforward and he made it clear that he didn't want them to be stressful.  We were given a good idea of what to expect from each one, and he wrote practice exams to help us prepare.  The problems he expected us to solve for the first time were orders of magnitude easier than the homework problems, and there were also problems from the previous homework on the exams.  
I only have one complaint, and that’s the this was the only upper-level math class he has taught here!  I know that many of us would've love to take more classes with him in the future.

I had a great time in analysis with Zhang- for an 8:40 upper-level math class, this is really saying something! Although the material had the potential to be hard, Xiangwen was really clear and made following his proofs as easy as possible. Especially in analysis II, where the topics are used regularly in other fields, he did a great job of motivating the material. 
Perhaps because the quality of the textbook (Rudin) deteriorates in the second half, Zhang did things his own way a lot in the second semester, giving different and often better proofs and instruction than Rudin. Accordingly, he also wrote a lot of the problem sets in analysis II instead of assigning book problems. For this reason, I liked the second semester better than the first since Zhang's mathematical personality started shining through.
The main problem with the class was pacing. In the first semester, we were supposed to get through chapters 1-7 in Rudin, but got only through 6. A chapter behind going into the second semester, there was a real time crunch towards the end and Zhang had to rush through the last two chapters. We spent but a single day on differential forms, which was the topic I was most excited about. It was a shame that the treatment of measure/Lebesgue theory was so light because a lot of the work we did for the Riemann integral (function spaces, Holder inequality, etc.) was obviously leading up to the idea of the L^p space.
The exams were very fair. The first few questions were True/False with justification, which were normally pretty straightforward. Zhang also always put a couple of questions that were either identical or very similar to HW/practice exam problems, so you are definitely rewarded for doing the work on your own. The averages were quite low, generating a large curve, so one could do quite well on the exams just by doing these easiest problems well, though no questions were impossibly difficult.
Workload:
Very Manageable. The weekly problem sets have 4-5 mandatory questions but generally only 1 or 2 require substantial effort. He also provides optional practice problems on every problem set that are great for studying from (Hint Hint).

Professor Diebel is sincerely one of the best teachers I've had in my three years here (CC).  So good, that I felt compelled to write this review as a rising senior (maybe I'm getting nostalgic already).  
First off, she was really great at balancing discussion and lecture.  You could tell she was smart and engaged enough in the material (unlike other professors I've had) to be able to actually respond to the momentum of a class extemporaneously and still fill it with articulate and thought-provoking points.  She's also incredibly approachable and just as smart outside of class, for office hours or after class.  She's super helpful with refining paper ideas or just extending the class discussion.   
In conclusion, the really bitter reviewer bellow was probably just sad that he or she didn't do well and get a professor who didn't care.

I noticed there's a bad review for this professor and I don't know why! I was in her English to the 1500s class, and I really enjoyed it! She gave a good overview of some very interesting literature, with an easy to follow crash course on Middle English, and she went out of her way to guide us when it came to paper-writing. The discussions were insightful as well, and I have used the basic knowledge of texts I learned in this class for many later courses :)

Dorian Goldfeld is a great guy! He's one of Columbia's most accomplished math professors, and that definitely bleeds through into the class. Often he'll prove things in non-standard ways that's he's encountered over the course of his career that are a little nicer than the regular way. One time he showed us a proof for a theorem that he made (and published) by himself, which was far shorter than the regular one. Having said this, some technical stuff will go over your heard. I wouldn't say he races through the material, but he's definitely not slow. This man is so comfortable with the material that he does pretty involved integrals and change-of-variables in a single step.
The first part of the course goes over the historical proof of the prime number theorem, and in the process covers an extraordinary amount of mathematical machinery, filled to the brim with incredible tricks I wouldn't have thought of in a million years. I wish at the end he gave a birds-eye view of the theorem we spent so long proving, so I could remember exactly how it all fit together. I think it got pretty myopic at points, but I can't say I didn't learn a lot in the process.
After the first part of the course I was a litte disillusioned because I felt that I knew a bunch of scattered techniques without feeling I understood the subject from the ground-up. This was remedied in the second part of the course, which was primarily focused on modular forms. I gotta admit, I really liked those modular forms. There was definitely an understandable component to them, even if the results got a little crazy at times.
The problem sets were actually pretty good. They were all 4 problems long and took over a day or two to complete, but not too much more. I had a really hard time with the first one because I had no idea what analysis was, but after that I was able to attack them with confidence. You'll DEFINITELY need to take good notes in able to do these problems, as they often require a result proved in class. The last problem set was the best, you got to prove a few results that looked like complete black-magic, and all on your own!
The final was reasonable. It too used things proved in class (and how they were proved). It was a take-home final over the weekend that lasted 24 hours. The class was very small, all filled with bright kids who understood mostly everything, and they all got good grades from what I hear. Goldfeld isn't a grade monster. 
The only prereq for the class is complex variables, but if you know all about the residue theorem and some facts about holomorphic / meromorphic functions, you'll be okay. Furthermore, I think a general mathematical interest is good to have, as he uses some group theory and linear algebra that aren't technically pre-reqs. Having said all this, the class is mostly self-contained.
Also, a word must be said for Goldfeld the man. He laughs a lot while teaching, and is generally very friendly and lighthearted. He talked to me on a few occasions, and genuinely seemed invested in having his students understanding the material. Sometimes he tells great anecdotes about himself or other mathematicians that bring a great character to the material.
I would definitely recommend this class, or any upper-level class taught by Goldfeld. I think this was a relatively painless and fascinating introduction to Analytic Number Theory, which has become a vast branch of math. You learn a lot of landmark results, and break a lot of ground into the subject. I can read wikipedia articles about the subject matter and understand almost all of it.

I can't shake the feeling that Khovanov was a dud. I like the guy, he's sweet, and actually incredibly smart. Look up ""Khovanov Homology,"" he's done a lot of ground breaking research (somehow being used a lot in String Theory). As a Modern Algebra instructor, though, he fell pretty flat.
Modern Algebra I is trivial for anyone who's been exposed to a group before. It was weird, somehow it didn't feel like we were ever really doing anything. I think the only interesting stuff was Burnside's Lemma (and group orbits in general), the Sylow theorems and the classification of Abelian Groups. I realized that I was doing fine in the class, but that was just because I had a good idea of how groups worked, not from anything I learned in lecture. The way Khovanov speaks makes it impossible to pay attention. It's not exactly his accent, I can always make out what he's saying at any given point in time, but the way he presents things is just bizarre, and I can't quite explain how. I had no problem paying attention in any other class except for his. Every time I tried to I would lose the thread after 5 - 10 minutes. By the way, this isn't just me: everyone I talked to in the class had the same experience.
Modern Algebra II is pretty bizarre. It definitely had a lot more content than Modern Algebra II, going briefly over Ring Theory and then spending a lot of time talking about Fields and Field Extensions, and then finally Galois Theory (apparently there's more to it than the unsolvability of the quintic, who knew?). I was excited to learn about Galois Theory, but now that the course is done, I can't honestly say I have. Sure, I understood the results, as they weren't too crazy, but I didn't really understand the process. The homeworks and tests really only test you on the results. I basically learned exclusively from the textbooks / Friedman's notes, as I wasn't able to pick up anything from the class itself.
It's not hard to get an A in Algebra II, but it is pretty hard to understand all the material at a good level. Maybe it's just Khovanov, who knows? When the TA came in to teach as a substitute a few times, it was like the clouds opened up and I understood everything.
The weekly homeworks aren't so bad, a lot of them are pretty easy, some of them use results proved in class which make things a bit harrier. The quizzes are all true / false, a few tricky ones, but not THAT tricky. The midterms were pretty easy, but the final wasn't that easy, not because of the questions, but because I had such a poor grasp of the material.
So... Algebra... A bit of a let down, not gonna lie.

I agree with everything in that last review. Not everyone has such a reasonable UWriting experience! Some teachers are really nasty. Apparently the instructors get to decide which articles their class will read, and I thought the articles that Campbell picked were pretty interesting. I actually read them! He understands what UWriting is, and doesn't make it painful. I talked to him a few times outside of class and he had pretty interesting things to say, he definitely has a lot of (chill) character. Also a nice accent.

Prof Blount is a lecturer. Expect class to be a rambling of his ideas of black male inferiority and the musings of a gendered racial historical narrative. Despite making up his own words and giving Woolf a run for her money in stream of consciousness rambling ad nauseum, Blount is on top of his game. He really cares about what he is talking about. He refuses to define sexuality. 
Blount integrated the Columbia English faculty on 1985 as the first black hire. He has a personal relationship with the authors we read (metaphorical and legitimate) and is eager to share with us his own experiences.
If anything the syllabus is incredible. AA Lit II is the way to go for a class that's readings are actually worth reading.

Up there as one of the worst professors I've had at Columbia. He didn't make an effort to make class interesting or worth attending, and he certainly didn't make an effort to seem like he cared about his students. He was rather rude or callous at times to my own and my peers' concern about homework or exams. I took this class against the recommend of a friend, and I would not recommend it to others.
At the same time, the material isn't horribly difficult to understand. This class probably ranks as an average to above average difficulty class in terms of economics electives depending on the person. Again, prof = bad.

I wasn't planning on writing a review on culpa but when you get the opportunity to take a class with someone like Reyes, I feel like I owe it to her to let everyone know how amazing she is.
This has been by far the most amazing/engaged/intriguing/ Spanish class I have ever taken in my life. The course is very well structure and this is outline in the syllabus that she post on Courseworks in the first week of class - each week covers a different topic which all links back to the core theme (Christianity vs. Islam in Spain) of the course. Each week she'll assign a number of reading, which can at times be very difficult, and you use these reading to complete a guia (which is basically a reading comprehension assignment) either in writing or orally on Voicethread (more on what this is below). Also, since there's no midterm or final, you are required to complete an oral presentation, two projects - one on a topic given by her and one free topic - and two diario del aprendizaje where you reflect on the materials you learn each week.  
I love that Reyes integrate technology to the course through the use of the discussion board in coursworks, voicethread and mediathread. For those who are not familiar, voice/mediathread are online learning platforms where you complete your assignment and interact with other students in the class. For example, we used mediathread to analyse the Portico de la Gloria - each student select a section which is of interest to them and then post about the significance/interest of their selection. 
I will say that you will have a lot of work (more than other section of W3300) in this course but they are totally WORTH IT. The works in time consuming, yes, and you really have to think a lot about what you're doing - it's not going to be simple assignment where you can look up the answer online, you have to analyze what you're learning. With that said, you Spanish skills will improve tremendously in this class, and if it doesn't them I'm sorry, it's not Reyes's fault but it's you not working/trying hard enough. In terms of grading, I think that everyone who put in the effort will end up doing well in this course. I wouldn't say this is an easy A class but if you work for it, it is very much a possibility. Also, she takes attendance and I think you're only allowed to miss 2 classes. 
Reyes really cares about her students, she is always willing to meet with you to discuss any questions/concerns and she is open to suggestions about ways to improve the course so if you don't like something be sure to let her know. The fact that she always give detailed comments back on your assignment shows how much she cares and how she really wants you to do well. 
I must admit, there were times when I really hated the course because of the sheer amount of work we had to do, but in the end, it was all worth it. I learned so much in the course and even thought I was not interested in religion to begin with, I must say I really enjoyed the materials we studied and I would by all means recommend this course to anyone who is considering taking W3300!

Yes, all the previous reviews for Daniela below says she's amazing and so will this one. Daniela is not just a great math professor but she's also a very sweet person if you have the chance to get to know her. 
I must admit, I never planned on taking Calc 2 (especially with the horror stories I've heard from my friends) but this course turned out not to be half as bad as I thought and I'll even say ended up really enjoying the class. 
First of all, Daniela is very good at her job, she's a great lecturer who is able to convey the materials in a way that everyone can understand. Although she has a bit of an accent, I don't think it was a problem for anyone. She will always start the lecture saying ""any questions?"" and she'll stop periodically to take any questions or clarify anything that you don't understand. I like that she did a lot of examples during lecture however I also wished that she had done a little more on the theory and proof behind the theorems we learn because otherwise it just becomes a matter of memorizing the formula and not understanding the logic behind what they are and why they work/why we use them etc. 
Also as a WARNING TO EVERYONE: the way that she lectures and does problems on the board makes it seems like math is very easy and this is true when you're just writing down whatever she's writing, BUT, don't not be fooled into this false sense of security because if you don't look over the problems and try to solve them yourself later you will be screwed over on the exams. And yes, her exams are brutal, but she does a review session in class before each one so be sure go over the problems she does in these sessions. She's always willing to help so if you need help go see her after class/during he office hour and if the hours doesn't work for you she also does OH by appointment. 
I want to also point out that for those who are not very mathematically inclined/are simply taking this course as a pre-req., you may fine her to be very monotonic and the lecture to be very dry. Daniela always comes in looking very tired/half dead (like all the time, sometimes I wonder if she's going to make it to the end of lecture) - DO NOT feed off this energy because it will make it very difficult for you to stay awake in class. Nonetheless, I would recommend Daniela to anyone who's thinking of taking calc 2.

Having taken Gallagher for two semesters now in the Honors Math A-B sequence, my overall feelings for him are definitely very mixed.
If you are looking for an easy time in an otherwise difficult class (Gallagher also teaches Modern Algebra and Modern Analysis), look no further. He prints out his own notes and doesn't need a textbook so everything you need to know is on those packets. You don't even need to go to lecture, since he just repeats everything he puts on the packets in lecture. As for grades, let's just say that last semester 75% of students got an A-range grade according to my transcript. He also gives out many A+'s.
That said, if you are looking to really learn the presented material and get something out of the class, I would stay away. As a math major with a strong passion for the subject, I don't think I'll ever be taking a Gallagher class again. 
- He is not a good lecturer. He speaks very softly in at a volume that is probably softer than a normal person's talking voice so it's very hard to pay attention, especially when he's just repeating what's on the notes anyway.
- He doesn't use a textbook. Some see this as a good thing, but as someone who learns best when given a very rigorous (albeit dense) presentation of the material, I found it hard to really learn the material through his notes. Gallagher's notation is his own which can be confusing, especially when his LaTeX skills are subpar and when his notes are not immune to typos.
Besides from this, his class can also be a pain with problem sets and midterms.
- Problem sets. The questions can be very tedious (""An exercise for the hands, not the mind"" he calls them), very vague, or occasionally just plain wrong (which he doesn't acknowledge until a day before the set is due). Plus each problem set varies greatly in length - one week we had a four problem set which took less than an hour and the next week we had a twenty problem set. Not to mention, the TA's only end up grading a very small fraction of the questions, so it's possible that you get those questions wrong and get everything else right and get an atrocious grade on the problem set overall. Plus it just doesn't feel good to write out two pages of tedious computations if they're not going to be graded anyway. I just don't see the point.
- He is very vague with midterms. He never makes the format explicitly clear, nor does he make the content. For our second midterm of this semester, we asked what would be tested on the midterm and he vaguely responded ""everything, but only the short proofs."" First of all, I don't see the merit in making us know every definition, theorem, and short proof to the point that we can recite them - it would be better to give us a list of the important ones he wants us to know and have us remember those (which my other professors do). Second of all, the proof he gave us ended up being Green's Theorem, which was one of the longest proofs of the semester (it was two pages long)! On the other hand, sometimes he surprises you with an easy midterm, which means that tiny mistakes have a huge impact. I forgot to state that an eigenvector must be non-zero and I lost 5/100 points on a test where we had to recite 25 total definitions/theorems verbatim.
- The final is easy. 25 T/F questions. He tries to trick you, but if you know your stuff it's pretty easy to figure things out.
All in all, Gallagher's class can be tedious and frustratingly vague, but definitely easier than other options for these theoretical math classes, and he gives out good grades VERY leniently. If you're looking to get something out of the class and really learn the material, I would choose another professor - they may be more difficult but it's worth it.

The midterm was super easy, just two civilizations, Egypt and Mesopotamia and the papers are easy if you put 1-2 hours into them.

He was not sympathetic in a grade change. Do not take this class, it is way too boring, I watched television in class and did other class work.

I'm going to be completely honest, Professor Taylor is a good lecturer. You will come out of this class knowing Psychology. But she is also a dick, and the TAs were no better. The percent of A's were 32% which is relatively low for a psych intro class and it's because every exam in this class was loaded with tricks and bullshit true or false questions. Also, the essays were graded extremely harshly. This class was the worst grade I will probably get in my college career.

Melissa Ball is an incredibly capable TA, who genuinely cares about you doing well in Nuckolls' class. As a post-bac, she took Colin's Orgo 2 in the spring of 2014. Afterwards she joined the Nuckolls group as a Chemistry grad student. She knows what high performance means for Orgo exam and will do everything possible to prepare you; during her recitations she often reviews particularly tricky mechanisms and goes through problems Colin prescribes during lecture. Melissa, like Colin, will stop to answer your question at any point during recitation, no matter how small. If you email her, she will generally get back to you. If you go to office hours or make an appointment, you'll find her to be very helpful.
Her quizzes are generally straightforward and test the material from the previous week's lectures. If you go over the lecture and recitation notes two or three times, you should do well on her quizzes.
My one criticism of Melissa's teaching style is that she often treats everyone in the class as if they were a fellow post-bac. Notecarding and memorizing every lecture mechanism, homework problem, and practice exam are the sort of things you can do if you're only taking two classes per semester, however this is an unrealistic recommendation for many undergraduate students. That being said, if you are a post-bac, Melissa's your gal. If you're not, go to her recitations, do what you can, and don't sweat it if you haven't achieved post-bac level studying habits. Oh, and later in the semester, she can be spotty about passing back quizzes
One last interesting note; Melissa's obsession with Colin is thoroughly entertaining. A friend once recorded the number of times she said Colin's name in a recitation (""Colin wants you to know..."", ""Think to yourself, what is Colin trying to test..."", etc.). 25 times.

Professor Varzi is the archetypal Philosopher. Heavy accent, wild hair, and surrounded by eager Grads and Undergrads pretty much everywhere he goes. Strikes a perfect balance between humorous and maniacal genius. Very approachable, and thoughtful, and known within the Philosophy community as one of the best teachers available. 
The course itself, Varzi will tell you, ascends and descends along a linear plane of difficulty. He's not afraid to tell you when the difficulty is increasing dramatically so you can be extra prepared/cautious in the work. First Order Logic is pretty much the equivalent of doing complex calculus in an alien language. Nevertheless, you'll start out slow, and TA sections are extremely beneficial. I struggled with the material nearly the entire course - most students did - but I left with a sincere appreciation for the tradecraft, and quite refreshingly aware of the pitches and turns in many complex philosophical arguments. 
Taking any course with Varzi is going to be a worthwhile experience, and I would highly encourage Symbolic Logic as an excuse to do just that.

I have just finished Professor Elmes' micro this semester, and thought I might add sth new to the existing comments.
To sum it up, this class is a great class with much hard work. So if you are only interested but not passionate about economics, I would recommend you to take micro from another professor. That being said, Professor Elmes is definitely the best choice for a intended econ major. She is a well-prepared and clear lecturer. She usually recommends us to read the textbook before coming to lectures, but after she explained them the concepts become much more easier to digest. She uses colored graphs, extensively explained formulas, and occasional handouts to help you understand the material in a crystal clear fashion. If you take notes systematically they will be enough for your preparation for the exams (though not for all the homework problems).
Professor Elmes is also very approachable. She welcomes questions in class and usually answers them with patience. There are one time or two she answered a question with haste, but that was because we were running out of time and the question was indeed somewhat stupid (she just mentioned the same concept 20 minutes ago). She takes questions in office hours as well and often strikes an interesting conversation with you.
The workload for this class is very big. Doing the problem sets themselves usually takes about 4-5 hours per week, but you also need to spend about 3 hours to discuss them with your study buddies. The midterm and the final are both very similar to the problem sets. So if you do all the problems carefully and review them before exams you should do pretty well. Good luck!

I have enjoyed this class very well, especially the lectures. It offers a pretty comprehensive perspective on Europe's last 200 years. The best part about this class is that we study history through a wide range of materials: the lecture discusses the events, the readings include contemporary documents, the movies offer unique interpretations, and the discussions analyze important philosophies of the period. Each part of the class has its function. Philosophies and ideologies are a focus of this class as well as the historical events. We have discussed liberalism, romanticism, socialism, nationalism, fascism, and many other contemporary philosophies relevant to the events. We include readings that are often the origins of these philosophies, which help us understand these complex ideas greatly. The class also does not fail to differentiate the By taking this course I have learned much more than historical events alone. 
There are, however, a few downsides to this course. The grade is not curved at all so it's a bit hard to figure out how you are doing in the class. The quality of the discussion sections vary greatly according to the TA you get. My discussion section was pretty dry for the most part, even if I've enjoyed reading the materials.

I was really looking forward to this class, and for the most part enjoyed it, but I feel like something went wrong this semester. The books are incredible and the lectures worth attending; the way this class is graded is a mess. 
Gamber is a glib, charismatic, and thoughtful lecturer, and I never regretted coming to class. He's fun to listen to! He usually spends two days on each book, with the first lecture more focused on author/historical context and the second on plot/themes/language/etc. The syllabus is expertly crafted, with a good mix of more popular texts (Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao) and things I had never heard of before (The Bird is Gone). I loved everything we read. If you’re an English major, it fulfills your American and Prose requirements as well as counting for Global Core, which is great. 
The way that this class was graded was really frustrating. One of the TAs dropped out at the beginning of the semester, so discussion sections were canceled. We were supposed to write a 5-page paper earlier in the semester that also got canceled, which put a lot more pressure on the midterm, final, and final paper. 
Midterm was fine—passage ID/short essay. Lots of options for the final paper topic, and TAs were really helpful, answering emails and holding extra office hours. (As far as I can tell, the TAs did all the grading in this class.)
The final was awful. I’ve taken a good number of English finals at Columbia, and this one was just *bad*. We had to identify 20 short, obscure quotes (from 11 books), and give the title, author, and one sentence about how we knew the quote was from that book. No literary analysis at all; it was basically a glorified reading quiz. I kind of feel like Gamber sensed people hadn’t been doing the reading as much as he wanted them to, and decided to punish us with this joke of a test. I read all the books and couldn’t identify all the quotes, and they definitely weren’t all quotes we discussed in class. 
Hopefully a lot of these problems were particular to this semester—as far as I can tell this was the first semester that canceled mandatory recitation sections, had no shorter paper, and gave a final that was a train wreck of super short IDs rather than a more thoughtful assessment of our understanding and analysis of the texts. 
Bottom line: Wonderful books, great lectures, frustrating grading. Take this class if you have time to read everything twice because the final's a doozy.

Ailsa Keating is wonderful and I would totally recommend her class.  This year was her first teaching at Columbia, and she's very young and enthusiastic.  I was in a small 8:40 am Calc IV section.  Keating is energetic and cares a lot about her students.  She doesn't have too much patience for students who never come to class, but for those who go (at least some of the time) she is super nice and approachable.  And I definitely recommend going to class.  I never read the textbook and easily got everything I needed to know for the course by going to lecture.  She loves student participation, learned all of our names in the first couple of weeks, and tended to call on students somewhat randomly.  And she once told us a story about climbing out dorm windows at Cambridge for fire drills.

I went into this class with a very open mind, and I was sorely disappointed. Pretty much everything about this class was terrible except for (a) the books and (b) the lectures (in terms of style, not content). To elaborate…
First, this class is cross-listed as English and CSER, but don't be fooled. The class is not at all an English class -- it is basically a study of race using the books as jumping off points. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but don't expect high-level analysis of the texts.
Second, on his lectures. He is a vivid speaker and quite lively, but the substance just isn't there. The class is structured so that every week is a different book, for the most part. Usually, he spends the entire first lecture or more on inconsequential things such as: the author (because the books are all recent, the author is often just a random adjunct professor at a random university -- who cares?—this often seems like he is trying to justify the importance of these obscure books and their authors), the historical background (again, it IS interesting, but not really related to how the class was presented), and the epigraphs (I'm sure we can all agree this one is a waste of time). After that hot mess, most of the lectures are him reading off slides. He is the kind of person that reads things emphatically and dramatically and believes it wholly alters the meaning of the words. In reality, he spends most of the time picking out important passages and reading quotes in an actor’s voice while barely giving any original analysis. In this respect, I would say the class very closely resembles a high school English class. But, his presentation is immaculate, almost like a well-orchestrated sermon. So, the lectures for me were a mixed bag: They started off amazing, but as I became accustomed to the formula I quickly started to dread them. In short, while I would generally really enjoy the lectures as they were happening, afterward I would think back and realize I gained virtual nil from them.
Third, the grading. The midterm was a total joke for not really any reason. Nearly everybody got a 9/10 or 10/10, and it is lunacy that the essays were graded out of 3. The long essay was graded way too harshly. Also, anybody who handed in the long essay a minute late was failed IN THE CLASS, which is major overkill. Thank God I was not in that boat. The final exam came out of the blue and was extremely difficult, again for seemingly no reason. It was essentially him picking out the most unidentifiable passages for us to ID (e.g., some books have Spanish every other word, and he purposefully found places where that wasn’t the case; another example, none of the “Oscar Wao” passages on the exam contained nerdy or Dominican references that pepper every other sentence). Basically, there was no rhyme nor reason to the grading system, and it seemed like he was making up the expectations as he went along.
For anybody considering this class, I will advise you: (a) You don’t have to be super progressive to enjoy the course as long as you keep an open mind. (b) Go to the first lecture—he is very consistent, so you will immediately be able to understand how the semester will be. And, (c) don’t take this if your GPA is more to you than a number. This class IS a sandbag. (I hope I don’t sound bitter—I have been looking forward to this review cathartically for weeks now when all I had gotten back was a 10/10 for the midterm.)
One last parting jab: Gamber likes to pretend he is a speaker for ALL people of color, to a comical extent. He doesn’t realize how transparent he is being, but he loves to artificially associate himself with the minorities in the books. For example, he will drop a comment like “everybody always pronounces this like X when it is really pronounced Y,” as if he is the authority on Vietnamese or Muskogee or whatever. It is just embarrassing, part of his progressive pathology and acclamation of victimhood, so I hope he sees this and cease-and-desists.

Savin is a boss. Somehow he makes everything seem obvious. He never looked at the book or notes during his lectures, and always talks in a very matter-o-fact manner. It's important to not let this get to your head too much- review the notes and make sure it really is as obvious to you as it is to him.
Savin holds the class to a high standard (or, if you ask him, a reasonable standard). He's sad when the average is always less than he thinks it should be. Here is an excerpt from the email he sent us after the class was over:
""The average on the final exam was 52. The exam was difficult and also the material we tried to learn.""
I actually think this class is important for math majors to take, even if it's not as sexy as other subjects. I did most of the homeworks pretty honestly, and I feel as though I learned a lot about how to think about PDEs and how to prove basic stuff about them (uniqueness, maximum/minimum principles, etc.) The class has more in common with analysis than it did with ODEs. (BTW, having taken ODEs before I took this class, the material / approach of the class is completely different; it's not necessary but if you're not a strong student it'll help you out.)
Keep in mind that most of your grade will be based on two tests where time pressure will be an important factor. DEFINITELY review the homeworks WELL, but don't stress out about knowing little facts. The tests will see if you understand the general philosophy of the proofs, which I'll outline here:
1. If you have to show the only solution to a PDE is 0, first try to prove that its minimum is >= 0 and its maximum is s no way to fake yourself to an A in this class, but if you take it seriously Savin will be less disappointed in you than he is in everyone else.

Wonderful course taught by a wonderful teacher. Professor Johnson is absolutely one of the best instructors I have had the opportunity of learning from. She is a bit eccentric, which allows for her passion of the texts to come through all the more clearly. And her passion is phenomenal, you can tell she must have read the texts numerous times, an example of her depth of familiarity became obvious when she sent out conflicting e-mails about which text to read for a certain day, so most of the class read a different text than the one she had been expecting to lecture on, she hadn't even brought a copy of the text most people read to class. After someone pointed out her mistake, she stopped and switched into lecturing on the other text, going entirely from memory. Though she is brilliant, she also is incredibly personable and very very willing to meet outside of class, even though it seems like she must be really busy with other commitments. She isn't like some professor's who take forever/never respond to e-mails, she will respond to your questions and make time to meet with you if you like. Like other reviews have pointed out, she is also great at pausing for questions, you can tell she loves to hear what the students are thinking about. I believe another professor usually teaches this course and Prof. Johnson won't be teaching next year because she will be on maternity leave, but if you can fit a section of this course with her as the professor into your schedule, you will not be disappointed.
Workload:
Pretty light I thought, You write a 5-7 page paper and a 10-15 page paper, though she says she doesn't actually care that much about the length, as long as the two papers at least meet the minimum 5 full or 10 full pages, the length beyond that is up to you, for instance you could write a 10 and a 20 page paper. Midterm and final are the same format, ID short passages from the readings covered thus far. Give the title, author, genre, contextualize the passage within the larger work as a whole and then do thematic and stylistic analysis of the poem (and they are all poems). I didn't really study that much or spend too much time on the papers (both were written pretty much the night before) and I ended up with an A in the class so I wouldn't say she is that harsh, but I went to every class meeting. This is an important point, you must go to class because she will take attendance. The really big threat to your grade in this class is if you  get lazy and don't go, your grade automatically drops so after two absences the highest grade you can get is an A-.

Professor Tran is amazing, and genuinely cares about teaching and his students. He's funny, engaging, and really, genuinely wants his students to not only succeed in his class, but to also enjoy the assigments and the course material. This is especially important for a methods course, where the material can be dry (and at times, it was, even for Tran). That having been said, the course was not an easy one, even if Tran wants you to succeed. The assignments are time-consuming and can seem a bit daunting or tedious at times, but you find ways to make them work. The readings started off as monstrous, with easily 150-200 pages of reading per week, but when he realized that the amount of reading he was assigning was unrealistic, he showed up at the next lecture with revised syllabi with fewer readings on them. Again, he really cares about his students. In a class of ~50, he managed to learn everyone's name (or, at the least the names of the people who showed up), and also read (but did not grade, that was the TAs' job) all of our assignments, and even remembered some of the observations we made and talked about them during class. If you can, take a class with Professor Tran. He'll make you want to care about the material as much as he does.

Brian is one of the nicest teachers I've ever had.  He has a genuine appreciation for physics and enthusiastic students, and he has many office hours and review sessions.  I started Columbia in the spring before I took 2801, and the number of close friends I made before 2801 pales in comparison to the number of close friends I made after enrolling.  Brian encourages students to help each other out.  I don't know whether this helped me understand the material, but it was nice to have moral support, and I think I will keep some of these friends for the rest of my life.  The grading was fair; if you understand most of the problem sets and do each one independently, you'll do well.
There were some downsides, however.  I would not recommend taking this class unless you are pretty serious about physics.  The assignments probably would have taken me 10-18 hours a week on average if I had sat down with each of them in a quiet space and finished them.  I certainly had friends who could do them in less time, though.  Sometimes I would not know how to do a problem, but there is a lot of support available in the form of office hours and friends.  I would recommend making at least two good study-buddy relationships.  Brian is neither the most organized or punctual person, but he does try his best.  He sometimes assumes that you understand more than you do, but if you are in this class you probably understand more than you think you do.

I'm kind of surprised there isn't a review for this class. Hasn't this been a BME requirement for a while? Anyway:
Professor Sia is all in all a very decent professor. He starts every class with a 15 - 20 minute review of the previous material. While this was useful, it sometimes did get a bit tedious if the previous material wasn't too difficult. But this is a minor complaint. He takes the time to ask if there are any questions, several times during the lecture, and often will take many minutes to answer the question, especially if the question raised some important point about the material that isn't directly covered. In this way, and he emphasized this many times throughout the semester, he made it clear that he isn't teaching us this class so that we can pass his class. His desire is for the class to understand the fundamentals of thermodynamics, so that we would be able to understand the literature about the topic, should we ever encounter it (we're BMEs, so yeah, it's gonna come up again). His examples in class are, for the most part, different from those in the book, so that we get twice the material exposure. 
Speaking of the book, it's absurdly dense, and we only cover about 25% of it. Thus, MAKE SURE YOU GO TO CLASS, OR AT LEAST GET THE NOTES. The exams ONLY cover material presented in class. If you study the book, you will likely fail, as it presents the material in a more stat mech sense than Professor Sia does. 
The TA, Henri, was perhaps the best TA I have had or ever will have. He answered all email questions promptly, was exceedingly bright, and conducted recitations with professionalism while making the material fun to think about. I think he's from a math background, as he would often get super excited and derive the mathematical bases behind some of the stuff we were covering, which I enjoyed. 
PSETS: Not easy, but we get an absurd amount of time to do them (like 2.5 weeks for one of them, 2 weeks for most). Half of the PSET grade is accuracy; the other half is a grade for your self-grading of them. So, your actual PSET grade will be much better than what you actually got. 
EXAMS: Very easy, especially with the rule that we can put anything we want on the equation sheet, double sided. Combine that with a knowledge of LaTeX or really small handwriting, and you can shove the whole course material on it. 80% of the exam is straight from a class example, a recitation problem, or a homework problem. There's a 10 pt bonus, which, both times, was a really simple derivation. The other 15% is basically 1 problem that is a bit of a curveball, but will not be difficult if you know the lecture material cold (or your equation sheet does). I don't remember the average for the midterm, but Professor Sia says the class average is a B or B+. 
Oh yeah, there's no curve. Zero. None. Everyone fails, everyone gets an A+, doesn't matter. But that shouldn't stop you from taking it. I had no background in thermo and did really well, so go for it. This only encourages collaboration and completely eliminates competition, so it's a really laid back atmosphere. 
All in all, you should take this class. The professor and TA are great, and the material is exceedingly important, and it's not hard to do well.

Professor Friedman is brilliant, so brilliant that he often forgets that the students are there to LEARN from him rather than attending an academic conference as mathematicians. For a Calc II class, I'd say he has made it unduly difficult. Not only was his teaching crazy fast and the exams excruciatingly painful (the median is often below 60, with no more than 4% students over 90) , but he also did not give a slightest damn to those puzzle-ridden students who reached out to him with a lot of problems. Quite often, he will just walk past you and pretend he doesn't know you if you meet him outside class and office hours. Adding to the misery, he does not drop a single homework and he simply doesn't curve in the exams! (He said he did, but you will be crazy to expect a raise more than 2% in an exam where the median is 57 and the SD is around 13)
All that being said, my friend also took his class and got an F after struggling through this whole semester. I am probably the only student who got away with an A but that was because I used to have a very solid basis in maths and physics back in high school.

Doing well in this class has nothing to do with going to the lectures. I went to one lecture, saw how absurdly boring it was, and never went back. I got an A. How? Well, the exams are essays, for which he gives the prompts well in advance (a FREAKING MONTH in advance in the case of the final). So, you just take the textbook, pick a prompt, and just write an outline of the essay you're going to write based straight off of the textbook. Oh yeah, the people who grade the test will pretty much ace you if you stick some information about primary source authors in there, so memorize that stuff as well. 
I'd say I put a good 3 - 4 hours of work (2 hours before each exam) into this class. Oh yeah, the discussion sessions are required. They're weekly, and aren't so much discussion. They're 50 minutes long, and half of it is the TA presenting a powerpoint to teach us what Harris was supposed to but didn't. The rest is meak discussion which no one was interested in, not really even the TA.

I have no idea why Professor Saggin does not have a silver nugget. Professor Saggin is one of the best professors that I have come across. She is Italian, lived and went to school in Italy; normally one would think that someone with such an advance level of Italian would not enjoy teaching the basics because it is beyond her. This is not the case for professor Saggin; she loves teaching and prefers to teach Elementary Italian because she says she enjoys how much her students can learn in just one semester. This attitude towards teaching IS KEY for an elementary class because IT WILL GET HARD and she understands that. She is extremely accessible and tremendously sweet. If you have a problem, miss class or get sick you can easily go to her office hours and she will accommodate you. I've taken Italian with Professor Saggin for a year now and the amount of Italian that i have learn is insane. She comes off as a little unorganized at the beginning but her madness has a purpose. Italian can seem easy at the beginning but the grammar is extremely comprehensive and will make you want to give up on the language. I had so much trouble with the grammar but Professor Saggin was so accessible that i have able to meet with her countless times to work the grammar through and not give up on the language. If you are thinking of starting italian from scratch, take the class with Professor Saggin and stick through it. She is a very lax grader because she cares more about you learning Italian than ruining your GPA. HOWEVER, if you don't do anything and don't show up to class, don't expect an A. She will meet you more than half way and will try to make Italian as painless as possible. Also, she is super adorable and stylist; her accent is a plus. She will try to get to know you and your background, which to me was extremely refreshing; she takes each of her sections to lunch, TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS BECAUSE SHE IS AN EXTREMELY SMART AND INTERESTING PERSON.

Leah Pires' section of ArtHum is what you wish every CORE requirement at Columbia could be; thought-provoking, relevant, and fun. I am a sophomore in SEAS, and I can say with confidence, that this has been my favorite course so far at Columbia. For the first day of class we were asked to contribute our favorite work of art and then explain what interested/intrigued/confused us about it. This was a foundational exercise that opened up an art dialogue that would continue throughout the semester.
While Leah is a graduate student instructor, the depth and quality of her art analyses are substantial. Lecture is hardly boring and a number of novel insights can be gleaned from just one sitting. However, class time is not spent idly taking notes or listening to Leah profess. Most of the contributions in class come from the students. She made it very clear at the beginning of the semester that the caliber of the course would be determined by our participation; no comment is too small, no question is too poorly worded for Leah. She brought out the best in our responses and was able to connect them to the art at hand.
Through many afternoons of observation I have learned that, as a rule, every contribution elicits a reaction from Leah. There's either a follow-up question or a paraphrasing statement that helps to moderate the class discussion. Even if she has no idea where you're coming from and doesn't understand the point you are trying to make, she will clarify until everybody understands what you're saying. And if that seems intimidating, it really shouldn't. Leah makes it clear that so long as you can substantiate your claim with details from the art, you're opinion is valid.
Leah's research focus is on modern art, so naturally the class spends roughly half of its sessions on 19th/20th century works. She does her best to include relevant readings that are directly related to the class material and are interesting to read. My one regret in this class is that I couldn't do more of the readings.
As for Leah herself, she very much fits the art scene ""type."" The only colors she ever wears to class are black, white, gray, or brown. Every once in a while she'll break out her favorite accordion pleated blouse with a Mona Lisa hidden in the folds (lookout for it). Her demeanor is very hip, calm, and talkative. Did I mention she's hilarious?
Workload:
Varies, but mostly medium. 
- 5 visual annotations (write on art) + 5 written annotations (write about art) = 10 short assignments, one per week. 
- Two museum assignments that are basically medium length (3-4 page) essays. 
- One final essay where you propose a cool art exhibit (finish during reading week cuz it sucks doing this the day it's due).
- The final consisted of short-response compare and contrast essays for sets of two images we had seen throughout the semester.

Although Professor Diebel was very kind, approachable, and accommodating, I did not feel that her class was sufficiently critical or informative, especially in comparison to the wonderfully engaging and compelling section I switched into for my spring semester of Lit Hum. Professor Diebel is very open to any ideas presented in discussion, and often does not present much material herself. This is an okay strategy that regrettably resulted in an uncomfortable atmosphere: incompetent comments trailed to nowhere, with little explanatory or clarifying remarks by Diebel. Professor Diebel's comments on my papers were often puzzling--I sometimes asked rhetorical (i.e. complicated) questions at the end of my discussion papers, to which she would sometimes respond with flippant and unproductive answers unrelated to the questions I asked. Unlike my other Lit Hum section, Professor Diebel's did not take much time to focus on marginal characters or question the assumptions of ""the canon"" which, if cliché, is quite important and, as I learned in the spring, added ~immensely~ to my experience of the texts. 
Of course, I don't mean to demean Professor Diebel. Take this with a grain of salt, as you always should. Basically, this section is probably better than some, but it's not sensational and certainly not memorable.

This was an excellent course, and I highly recommend students (non-majors as well) take this course if they have the opportunity. Although Alberro's speech is long-winded, he responded well to questions and encouraged students to ask questions despite the size of the course. 
The mandatory discussion sections are highly useful and it is important to do the reading, as participation in the section contributes to part of your final grade calculation. I'd say that the discussion section is the most important part of the course, as your TA grades all of your assignments. 
You can definitely get away with reading the book and skipping lecture, but it is an enjoyable class so there is no real reason to skip. It is also important to understand what Alberro emphasizes throughout lectures, as it informs the questions on the midterm and final in ways that you cannot gleam from the textbook. 
The grading in the course is dependent upon your discussion section leader. Look at the TA's carefully before selecting a section and consider taking an undesirable time if it means choosing a ""nicer"" TA. 
The reading in the class are optional. I read the corresponding textbook readings during the first half of the semester, but did not do the readings during the second half. 
Alberro gives you a list of 25 images that could potentially show up on the exams (midterm and final), so you can do the reading after you get that list. The hardest part of preparing for the exams was selecting appropriate secondary texts to support your argument. For each slide comparison on the exam, you needed to incorporate one reading. We go over readings in discussion section, but it is still a challenge.

Professor Friedman was an incredible professor!  His lectures were very organized and he made sure to do many example problems or answer any questions we had at any time.  Before our midterms, he would host a review session the night before to make sure we had no doubts about what was going to be on the exam.  Although his homework is challenging, he makes the exams very fair and easier than the homework itself.  Calculus 2 is a difficult class nonetheless so I recommend you choose Professor Friedman if you want to come out of the class knowing the material.

Irving Kalet is the man. I would say this class is one third a history lesson. Kalet loves to bring context to the material he teaches, which I really enjoyed. I felt like he genuinely wanted to share his love of communications with his students. He manages to bring up Picasso in a EE class and cannot stop talking about how Hedy Lamar is ""the most beautiful woman in the world"". I also live for every time he brings up cellular communications. He ALWAYS asks for a student's phone, holds it up, points at it a few times, talks a bit more about cellular communications, then returns it. Priceless. 
I highly recommend this class. In the EE course flow, you're given the option between Computer Networks and Intro to Communication systems. If you're at all interested in Communication Systems and want an easier class, definitely take E3701.
Workload:
The workload is relatively low. Kalet assigns problem sets once a week and the TA basically just checks that you wrote something down. The problem sets are graded based on ""effort"". There is one midterm and one final. If you do worse on the midterm than the final, Kalet will drop your midterm grade. Kalet also gives multiple practice tests for both the midterm and final. He usually puts similar material every year, so the tests aren't difficult.

I, presumably along with the 350 other students, took this class since it was a 1000-level history Global Core that I needed out of the way. Most people never showed up to lecture since Van de Mieroop is really boring and drones on about inconsequential details of the lives of Egyptians. It was far from riveting.
Though this was a 1000-level 3 credit class, it had a fair amount of work. It was perhaps Van de Mieroop's way of making the class harder to hurt everyone who took this thinking it was an easy A global core. We had to attend mandatory recitations with 3 pop quizzes, were actually forced to do the readings every week and submit a short write up about them online and lead the discussion for one recitation. It was an awful waste of time since the TA didn't really know much about Egypt nor did anyone really care.
We cover the whole shabang from origins of Egypt to the Greco-Roman period in excruciatingly boring detail. Everything he says in lecture is word-for-word in the textbook so a lot of people skipped it though you learn the things he focuses on in tests if you attend class. About 50-70 pages of light reading per week that you can skim through since it's just a rehash of class.
Your grade entirely depends on your TA who manages everything for you. I took this thinking it was an easy A but somehow only got an A- even though it was total BS. Grading was harsh for a class that even the teaching team knew nobody cared about. If you need to take a Global core, there are probably better options with less work.

Professor Drinea is a solid pick for Algorithms I and she has taught for the past two spring semesters. Here is what you are in for:
Lecture--
Professor Drinea is an okay lecturer. I had some trouble understanding her sometimes because of her accent and the fact that she is somewhat soft spoken. This was exacerbated by the horrible acoustics of the classroom (Mudd 833). That being said, she is quite good at explaining things, though you will need to review some content afterwards (as well as do some reading prior to lecture) to learn the maximum amount. All slides are posted on the course wiki.
Content--
We covered a ton of content this semester (and according to my roommate, more than most Algorithms I classes cover). This included increased coverage in Linear Programming, P/NP Reductions, and a bit of Approximations. There was also a hackathon early in the semester that went over applications of various algorithms for those of you who are more programming focused.
Homeworks--
6 assignments that ranged from really easy (graph algorithm pset) to crazily difficult (dynamic programming pset). They are due every two weeks.
Exams--
Closed book midterm and final. Midterm was incredibly long and difficult. Final was more reasonable length, but still pretty difficult. Averages were pretty low.
Office Hours--
TA office hours are a mixed bag. Sometimes TAs don't know the answer to questions or have trouble explaining it. Being able to speak Chinese with them is actually a huge plus. Professor Drinea is very helpful in her office hours, so definitely go to her. On the whole, these are very important for succeeding in the class (unless you are absolutely brilliant).
Grading--
Very reasonable. I slacked the first half of class and finally picked up my game in the latter half (went to OHs and lecture). After all was said and done, my scores were a tick below the mean and I ended up with a B, so the curve appears to be the standard B/B+ for mean.

This class was a lot of work. I don't think that was a reflection on TW, but rather UW on a whole. I actually thoroughly enjoyed this class though, and would definitely choose to take it with TW if I had it to do over. In the beginning of the semester I was a bit skeptical of her and her teaching style, but she really warmed up as the semester progressed and the class was pretty enjoyable even with the heavy workload. I do not agree with the previous reviewer and feel that my writing improved a ton and that I was definitely able to apply what I learned in even the classes I took during the same semester. She's by no means an easy grader, but she's definitely not a harsh one either. Overall I thought her grading was pretty fair, and for me at least reflected the work I put in. Definitely take advantage of the writing center. I didn't and regret not doing so as I probably would've ended up with a half to a full grade higher.

A number of people switched from Minghan's section to the other in the beginning of the semester because the other guy seemed easier. Don't think that turned out to be the case, so definitely stay in his section if you get him. Attendance is really not necessary however, and there were less and less people who went as the semester progressed. Many people just showed up for quizzes. Minghan presented the information pretty clearly though, and there were no communication issues whatsoever. His emails always made me laugh. He was always willing to listen to any concerns the class had, and really did take them into consideration. He continuously adjusted the difficulty of the quizzes and exams and they reflected where he knew the class was at in terms of mastery of the information. Everyone was freaking out before the final and the number of equations that were going to have to be memorized for it (20% on each midterm, 40% on second half of the semester), so he ended up providing a small equations sheet which did help a bit. If you do well on the homework, quizzes, and midterms, you can bomb the final and you'll still be fine. I was.

Before taking this class I heard mixed review about Luis and of course I came into the class skeptical of how it would turn out. After a semester with Luis, I would like to say that my overall experience was a positive one - yes, the course/materials was challenging at some point, but Luis made them really interesting and I ended up really enjoying the course. 
Luis is a very knowledgeable professor and he does a good job lecturing (he has a bit of an accent but this did not interfere with his delivering of the materials). The first part of the course (before midterm #1) was relatively easy and the pace was a lot slower compared to later in the semester. I also felt that we did less examples with problems/questions in class as the semester went on and sometimes I felt that this made it difficult for me to understand what we were learning; nonetheless, the homework problems help reinforce the theorems/formulas learned in lecture. Luis also likes to go over goemoetric representations and proofs - a lot of time I felt like he would just end up talking to himself because everyone would be lost a minute after he begins, but not to worry, these are to help you understand how to derive the formulas and it's ok if you don't know how to proof them yourself, you just need to know the forumlas for the exam.
The homework in this course are pretty long compared to other section of Calc 3, there are normally anywhere from 15-20 questions and the TA will only grade 4-6 of them. The good thing is that we don't have to do any webassign :) Most people will end up getting around 10/12 or 11/12 on the homework and he will drop the 2 lowest homework grades at the end. The first midterm was relatively straight forward but the second was a lot harder - I failed the second midterm (literally) and I stilled ended up with a very good grade in this class so don't worry if you don't do so well on the midterm. He usually returns the midterm a week after the day it was taken and regrades are due the next class after they are returned.
In terms of office hours, Luis is very helpful and he truly cares about the success of his students. He will go over any problems/questions you have in detail and if you don't get it he will try and explain it in a different way. Not a lot of people show up to OH so be sure to go if you need help.

The previous reviewer basically articulated all of my thoughts about Roma word for word. I must give him more credit though. 
Taking both of the classes that he offers to his undergraduates, I can assure you that Roma certainly embodies the term ""cult of personality"" more than any other professor I have encountered throughout my time year (I have another year left, but I doubt I'll meet any professor that matches up to Roma's charisma). However, while I must say that, yes--my photography has improved after taking both of his courses, I do wonder how much I (and others who listen to his every word with the assumption that they are words of wisdom) could have improved even more if such a large part of my time in those classes was not spent on listening to his musings like a disciple. Especially with his Photo 3 seminar--which is handled much more leniently than Photo 1--where much of the class is spent on chatting with Roma and there is much less pressure to produce work consistently. As a result, I found myself scrambling at the last minute to put together the final project for that class. If you really want to improve your photography, definitely reach out to Roma with specific questions and he will answer them, as well as the TA's. The TA's provide the helpful/technical counterpart to Roma's philosophical take on the classes. But of course, Roma is not a world-class photographer for nothing, he is of great assistance if you badger him in your office (which he loves!). Don't be fooled by his intimidating and bully-ish aura (though you inevitably will be at first), he is honestly a very kind and dedicated person who is ready to sit with you in his office for hours and feed you yummy cannolis during the seminar. 
If you're gonna take Photo I, definitely try to take it with Roma, simply for the fact that it will be a standout class in your Columbia experience, regardless of how much you end up liking/not liking it. Be prepared to seek out for help on your photography skills and don't fall face first into the trap of Roma's charm. Definitely listen to what he has to say but don't assume that everything he speaks is passed down through God. Like the previous reviewer said, he gets away with a lot more than other people do.
P.S. Don't be afraid to disagree with Roma on something he says! He is (somewhat) open to engaging debates.

I've taken three classes with Cassie (1 lecture and 2 seminars) and she is definitely on my top 3 list of favorite professors at Columbia. She is extremely dedicated, understanding, challenging, and accessible. One of the things that I really appreciate about Cassie is that she always urges us and pushes us to articulate our ideas and thoughts with more simplicity and clarity (while at the same time pushing us to make our preliminary thoughts more complete), as opposed to enshrouding them in academic jargon. She considers this a really important skill to have considering that many of us want to climb down the ivy tower that Columbia students often get stuck in, for the sake of helping people. Cassie is also a very positive and encouraging professor and always makes it a point to mark your abilities and groundbreaking thoughts when they present itself. She always takes a minute after class to tell you about how well you did on the individual presentation, which is really sweet. She is not traditional in her teaching style, often allowing students to explore different venues of expression in the final project for her seminars, whether it is an essay, video, podcast, etc. Also, Cassie is not the type of professor to force you to participate all the time or call on you. I always felt comfortable as someone who tends to listen more in class than speak, which is not always the case for some of my other classes.
Her presence as a white professor in the ethnicity & race studies department can be somewhat questionable for a department that is primarily intended to comprise faculty of color for students of color, but her openness has put me (and hopefully others with the same concern) at ease. She is not pretentious or self-righteous in the least and is always open to discussing ideas that might challenge which she has to say.

Quantum Mechanics is fascinating. Many questions you may have had as a chem student are FINALLY answered...and thats a great feeling!
Class (Professor Zhu): 
Professor Zhu really knows how to lecture. I would best describe his teaching style as a balance of humor and clarity. His enthusiasm/passion for the subject matter really shows in each class (and lasted throughout the semester). I wasn't sure what to expect going into this class. It soon became the highlight of my week. He doesn't use powerpoints. He writes/speaks very clearly and is very easy to follow. The material mimics the textbook but I still found class extremely useful in order to see what was emphasized (see Workload), ask questions, etc. His constant jokes/poking fun of classmates created a really interactive/friendly atmosphere and made him very approachable as he soon began to learn a lot of our names over the course of the semester. He truly wants to see each and every one of his students succeed. Overall, he was a much better professor than most ""silver nuggets"" and I can highly recommend him as a lecturer in this subject matter.

Pre-requisite: Intro Orgo lab - It is assumed you are familiar with organic chemistry laboratory techniques. This is not meant to replace intro orgo lab but rather supplement it. *If you took Intensive OCHEM Lab, its nice to take this course the next semester*
Course: The Course follows the same format as Intensive OCHEM Lab. Read the experiment and prepare your pre-lab notebook before class. In the beginning of class Fay lectures about the experiment to be conducted that day. If its the last day of an experiment, a quiz will be given before going to lab. In Lab you carry out the experiment. These experiments alternate between Short (2-3 class periods) and Long (3-4 class periods). Some days you may finish very quickly. Others you may have to wait a while as the reaction is carried out. You will be assigned a lab partner whom you will work with for the duration of the semester (each has to do an individual lab report). All labs work smoothly for the most part. Lab reports require you to think critically and read source articles in order to explain the results you obtained. This class is great for many reasons including: getting into the habit of reading academic journals, writing in an academic manner about experiments conducted, conducting cool experiments in areas of Chemistry not usually touched upon in Intro OCHEM courses (Molecular Sensors, Chiral Resolution/Asymmetric Synthesis, Metal Organic Frameworks, Material Chemistry/Photovoltaics).
Professor Fay Ng: Fay is such a great professor. Her lectures are succinct and help clear up any questions you may have about the experiment. She is very approachable in office hours/ class and makes an effort to get to know her students personally, taking an interest in their activities outside of class. She started this class a while back and you can see the effort put into refining it over the years as the experiments actually work and allow you to develop/strengthen OCHEM lab techniques. By the end of the class, I felt more confident in my ability to work in a  lab environment, my understanding of the subject matters, and my writing abilities. I feel very fortunate to have had her for a full year of lab and can highly recommend any of her classes to my peers.

* A slight learning curve for quizzes and Lab reports. While your first few grades may not be too high, you soon learn from your mistakes and notice an improvement in these areas.

Professor Balsam, as the previous reviewer said, has really been misrepresented.  Before you continue reading, I am going to preface this by saying that I am a Neuroscience major and pre-med and did well in the class; perhaps the negativity in the other reviews stems from the fact that those students did not receive an A.  
I found his class to be one of the easiest classes I have ever taken.  Yes, there is some math...but seriously, it's just basic algebra, nothing a Barnard student isn't capable of.  If you read the book, go to class and take notes, and study for the tests, there really is no reason why you can't get anything less than an A- on his tests; they are very straightforward.  Plus, he lets you throw out three questions on the test!  Can't go wrong with that.  
To do well on his tests, read the book and answer his study questions to the best of your ability.  Any questions you have on those can be brought to Balsam who is so wonderfully accessible to his students.  He really does care and it's quite refreshing to have a professor who cares as much as he does. 
Speaking of how much he cares, Professor Balsam is an incredible resource.  He has the most amazing connections, especially at the Columbia Medical Center (he also his own psychology/neuro lab at the medical center for those of you who are interested in his research).  For those students out there who are looking to find a lab at the medical center, Balsam is the guy to go to.  Trust me, he is so nice and friendly...he will hook you up with the lab of your dreams!

Agreeing with the two reviews below mine for sure. All in all I had a pleasant experience with Karen, enough so to stay in her section for two semesters. She has the following way of dissecting texts: she offers up an idea which initially sounds extremely confusing, yet intriguing enough to keep you listening, then builds on the idea throughout class, molding it in different ways according to other thoughts the class pitches in, until finally it starts to emerge with clarity and you find yourself with a solid grasp on the text. You aren't quite sure how you got there, but you're there. There are definitely times when the class never quite reaches this moment of clarity. but luckily there was almost always some brave soul who would flat out ask ""what exactly does this mean?"" in which case Karen would eagerly try again and take another approach to explaining. That being said. there was never any question left unfulfilled. If you are into getting your facts hard and fast, this isn't the section to take. Personally, I found myself getting a lot out of the process approach we took-- tossing ideas around and around until we finally come to something gold. It encourages deeper thinking, which yes, is draining and annoying at times, but worth it in the long run, in my opinion. 
Something to note about Karen is that she feeds off the vibe of the class. I feel like our first semester class was a lot more enthusiastic and conversational, and as a result Karen was always very chipper and into her lectures. In the second semester, there were times when she made it clear that she was let down by our frequent silences and tendencies to leave the talking to individual people, rather than responding to one another. Because of this, I think the experience you get with Karen can really depend on your classmates. This is generally true with newer teachers. 
As stated below, Karen is very fair with grading in terms of essays and tests. She never makes the workload overwhelming, and you won't find yourself scrambling to get stuff done for CC with her. However, she's pretty strict about participation. You won't make an A if you only participate one and a while. She will notice if you're absent, and she even got mad once because people kept leaving for the bathroom. It's definitely rooted in good intentions, though, because she just wants her students to be as enthusiastic about the material as she is.  
Also if you frequent the gym you can probably bond with her over that. I lost track of how many times she related our texts to working out at the gym, or like restraining oneself from eating a brownie.

After taking Doubleday's orgo class first semester, I found Nuckolls's class to be refreshing (and much easier). The hardest part was actually attending the lectures at 8:40AM. It was a bit hard for me to follow along in his lectures, since he goes fast and covers a lot of material in each session. This year, he posted all his lecture notes online, so it was super convenient to just browse through his notes and fill in any gaps I may have missed during the lectures.
Pros: Good lecturer, online notes available, fair grading/curve (exam averages this year hovered around mid-40s to 70's so if you think you bombed an exam, it's very likely everyone else did as well - which helps the curve!), no homework but optional problem sets that definitely help for the exams, tons of practice exams and office hours available, less post-baccs = less competition 
Cons: Fast lecture pace, notes can be a bit sloppy and unclear, keys to the practice exams were incomplete (went to office hours, but sometimes even the TAs didn't know the answer, so it's best to ask the prof directly), 8:40AM lectures
Some advice: I originally studied for the exams by reading and rereading the textbook (and taking copious notes), which left me little time to do the practice exams when it came to exam time. I HIGHLY suggest going through a single practice exam FIRST (just browse through it to get a sense of what'll show up on the exam), going through the lecture notes and highlighting the stuff covered in the practice exam, and THEN reading the textbook if you need to. What Nucholls actually tests you on is only a small fraction of the textbook material, so you really only need the textbook to look up mechanistic details; otherwise, reading the textbook is a complete waste of time. 
Overall, compared to Doubleday, Nuckolls was a much better lecturer with fairer exams (in my opinion). I received an entire letter grade higher in Nuckolls's section, but I don't necessarily think I studied any harder in second semester orgo. Either way, orgo was by far one of the hardest classes I've ever taken, but shoot for Nucholls, work hard, and you may get a great grade with only half the stress that comes with the other orgo sections!

Prof Siegel is funny, good natured, and someone who'd enjoy a beer and discussing Star Wars and Comic-Con.  That being said, I would NOT recommend him for anyone who has no previous experience with Calculus.  Much of his lectures are a combination of ""Math-speak"" and pretty complex ""examples"" which seem more for his amusement than to teach foundational concepts.  If you've read any other reviews, his weekly written homework will make the math tutors at Milbank 333 cringe!  Honestly, the written HW takes up a lot of time and I didn't learn a thing from it since he often includes material that you'll never encounter in Calc I (e.g. Hyperbolic functions).  If you're a math major and just have to take calc again, go ahead and take this class.  If you're anyone else (like me), you'll end up watching hours of Khan Academy or YouTube to teach yourself!  Which by the way, check out Professor Leonard on YouTube -, he's an instructor at some small college in Georgia, but his explanations are clear and concise.  If it wasn't for him, I would have failed this class miserably.
And lastly, Prof Siegel is not very organized, if you have to ask him something, talk with him before or after class or during office hours.  I emailed him multiple times over the semester but never received a reply.

I'd have to disagree with the reviewer below who did not enjoy this class. I think Robert Friedman is a brilliant teacher that will teach his students the mathemagics of Calc II. In class Friedman can go over the concepts really quickly, but if you ask him to go over something he will stop and explain things to you. He constantly is teaching us ""tricks"" (in his words) that enable students to become mathemagicians. Also I found Friedman very approachable and friendly. He would say ""Hi"" to me when he saw me (even when I saw him in Riverside Park). Since Friedman is fast-paced in class, sometimes my notes after class were not very good, but I would go to the book and review the material. This is one thing I would suggest since the class was closely tied to the book. Going over the material in the book helped clarify certain concepts for me. The homework was straight-forward, but hard. Nevertheless, I never went to office hours because the online book gave great examples of how to solve certain problems. The day before every midterm and the final Friedman would hold a review session which would be closely related to the material on the exam. The midterm averages were low. The first midterm had an average of 63% and the second had an average of 73%. I'm not sure what the final exam average was. I ended up getting an A in the class, even though I only had a Calc I background. My first midterm average was an 87% and my second midterm average was a 74%. I got a 96.5% on the final exam. My HW average was a 95%-ish. I put in a considerable amount of work for this class, but I was nowhere near killing myself with work. I would suggest that do practice problems online in order to do well.

Friedman is a polarizing guy- just look at the all-or-nothing reviews below this one. Yet, I'm pretty split on him. If Friedman is (in)famous for anything, it's for talking faster than the disclaimers at the end of a medicine commercial. While this isn't untrue, he doesn't actually move through material as quickly as one would expect by counting his words-per-minute, instead drawing out the obvious and writing out every detail to the extent that his proofs are nearly computer-checkable. 
This isn't entirely bad, especially if modern algebra is your first real proof-based class, but it makes the class appear to move a lot faster than it does and there were some topics we didn't have time to do. For instance, we did very little with symmetries of geometric solids, which is traditionally an important application of group theory.
The bright side is that Friedman is pretty devoted to this class. He wrote up solutions for the problem sets, posted review sheets, and held review sessions all to help us prepare for exams. I think he even knows my name but I haven't found a way to test this theory.
The exams themselves are all straightforward. He sometimes takes ideas from the homeworks, so doing them is advisable just in case you were on the fence.

Professor Castelli is one of the best professors I have encountered at Columbia University. I think I am not alone in this opinion given the number of students who have taken her more than once.
As a person and a Professor, Castelli is more interested in teaching and you learning then getting caught up the minutia of you knowing every text and detail by heart. She understands that we have a significant workload and wants to help her students succeed in the class. This does not mean she lets us off or out of work, but that throughout the semester she works with us and is flexible. She expects a lot out of her students, however none of it is unreasonable and I probably learned more efficiently in her class than any other. 
I came to this class with ZERO knowledge of Christianity or religion, of the history of the period we were looking at or the cultures. In that way I was way behind my classmates, however Castelli made the subject approachable and engaging. She focused on a very palatable cross section of the period that was not overwhelming and then asked thought provoking questions that really encouraged us to bring these ideas together in a way that made sense to us.
In addition Prof. Castelli is kind and very generous with her time – eager to know her students and help them. Her classes are enjoyable. The end result is that even those texts that I did not get to read entirely during the semester I will read on my own because she sparked my interest.
I have read some less then favorable reviews of Prof. Castelli and I am somewhat baffled. Yes she has strong opinions on some topics but none of them were alienating and she really encouraged students to bring their own ideas and experiences to the table. Our class was made up of Jews and Christians of various strains. We went through some very touchy and at times difficulty materials and at no time did anyone get offended or ostracized.
I think Castelli is the sort of teacher who attracts rather than promotes and highly recommend her.

This class validated my decision to come to Columbia.
In order to give you an idea of who I am, and the background from which I am approaching this course, let me tell you about my Lit Hum experience. As someone who is not keen on the humanities, the Core has not been my greatest ally.  Lit Hum was a harrowing experience for me, characterized by a terrible professor who refused to teach and somehow found a way to make the greatest works that the West has ever seen more tedious than the most annoying problem set one could fathom. As a result, I read approximately 30% of the Lit Hum syllabus.
However, Beau reversed all that. He somehow inspired me to want to read every word that was assigned. I would find myself compelled to finish each text, just so that I can fully engage with everything that he says and is said. He has a way of inspiring people to speak. Discussion becomes interesting. He does not shy away from confrontation but invites it. If you have something to say, it will be fully considered.
Some days which I would make sure not to miss: Plato, Maimonides, Bible, Rousseau, Marx, Kierkegaard, and Nietzsche. Pay special attention to Kierkegaard. My world view was very shaken by this discussion.
A typical day proceeded like this: We would arrive at class and put our response papers (if you chose to do yours that day) on the stack in the front of the room. Then, once the class settled, he would give a 5-30 minute background on the text we are reading (length varies dependent on how much he likes said text). Next he will ask, ""so what did you think?,"" prompting an informal discussion. Finally, we would go through parts of the texts that Beau deems as particularly important or informative until the end of class. Often, this last part of class is not long enough because Beau likes to be thorough in what he talks about, so large portions of the texts are on you to figure out (he has nice, long office hours though). When class ends, you'll find yourself surprised that it's been two hours and wishing there was some more time!
There are some things though to be wary of when choosing this class. If you are religious, while Beau tries to be respectful, the Bible and medieval texts may be an unpleasant experience for you because he has a strongly secular bias. He will listen to and fully consider anything you say, and only critique in an intellectual and thoughtful way. Next, if you do not want to put in the work, I would not take this class. While you could probably get away without reading, not reading greatly diminishes the experience. Of course, there will be times during the semester when it becomes difficult to read before class. However, if you plan on not reading consistently, I would not advise taking this class. Otherwise, he taught sections from 2-4 and 4-6 on MW my year. Try to get into this section!

Nataliya is not only one of the best professors I have ever come across, but is truly one of the most kind-hearted and welcoming individuals on this planet.  Seriously.  In class, she is a compassionate (albeit demanding) professor, who sets high expectations and thoroughly invests herself in the progress of her students.  She always comes to class with a huge rush of energy, despite the fact that she teaches multiple sections and oversees the entire language program (with Alla Smyslova, I believe).  Moreover, she makes herself essentially available at all hours - willing to meet at any time, answering e-mails late at night, staying after class to talk, etc. 
She and her husband Ilya (also a fantastic human being) recently came here from Harvard, and they both are exuberant and devoted to their subject.  I have heard stories of students going to Russia and meeting up with Nataliya and Ilya, going around the city with them to concerts, bars, museums, etc.  For me personally, Nataliya has been an essential member in my progress - writing numerous letters of recommendation (often at short-notice), referring me to different language programs and different people, offering advice, discussing topics related to other courses, talking about life, etc.  
I wholeheartedly recommend Nataliya, and would tell any of my friends to take Russian with her as a must before leaving Columbia.

WARNING: STAY AWAY FROM HER CLASS! I had Heather for CC and because of her it became one of my least favourite classes at Columbia. She has a very weird way of teaching. This class is suppose to be about building/sharing your ideas with other students. It has to have a professor that is slightly flexible (not asking for much), but Heather is the opposite of that. 
I agree with the review that explains how she begins every class with a 5 min introduction, stating random facts that don't really help with the discussions. It kills your mood at the very beginning of the class. Also she has a habit of putting people on the spot, and judges you if you don't say what she wants you to say. In short, not a chill professor at all! She cares about her work, but cares too much, and that becomes an issue. 
Grading: She is pretty harsh when it comes to grading. For example, in my 12 page research paper, the spacing between the paragraphs weren't according to her guidelines (forgot to mention.. she has a 12 page guideline for a 12 page research paper) and while talking to me about it I am pretty sure she said ""the paper looks atrocious"" (REALLY??!!) there are better ways of saying things.. Moreover, this just shows how anal she is about things. Honestly I dislike her so much.

I was super excited about this class. I had purchased all the books and started the reading (based on an old syllabus) over the winter break. Professor Hawley has written and edited some wonderful books on Hinduism. He is a very enthusiastic teacher with a broad knowledge of the subject and an impressively deep knowledge of those areas he specializes in. My guess is he is a wonderful teacher for graduate students and smaller seminar courses where students can ask questions that help keep him on track, however I would NOT RECOMMEND his Hinduism 2000-level lecture where he plays the stereotypical absent minded professor. This can seem endearing and amusing until you realize that every lecture will be a struggle to understand what it is he is trying to get across. Each class starts somewhat on topic however quickly descends into a labyrinth of anecdotes, side stories and tangents that make it difficult to understand what parts are important – even with the aid of the outline he provides for every class it is a challenge. If you take this class use the TAs – the ones we had were knowledgeable and very eager to help students understand. I would have been in trouble without them.
I recommend using a laptop for notes and transcribing each lecture – this will be indispensable come exam time for searching for terms. Prior to mid-term and final exams you will be provided with a list of about 50 terms that were mentioned throughout the course. Many of these will be obvious. Some will baffle you. Some of these baffling terms will have been mentioned – in passing – in lecture but nowhere in the readings or handouts so they may not have stood out. In the study group of four people I worked with throughout the semester, all of us good students, we came across terms like this (“raga” for example) that not one of us had included in our notes – they simply had not seemed significant in lecture – we lost hours of valuable study time at final exams searching for these before we gave up and contacted the TAs. Other terms will not have been mentioned in lecture or merely be a symbol or term in a handout text or poem that received short or no mention at all. You would have read it once with no inkling of the hours you would spend later trying to find it and explain why it (for example “the black bee”) is so vital to Hinduism. Unfortunately the Professor is unwilling to provide these lists at the onset of the term so you cannot make note of the seemingly insignificant term when you encounter it. It makes exam preparation less of a review and more of a scavenger hunt through reams of readings, books, handouts and notes.
Do not mistake this for an introductory course. While I’m sure it hardly scratches the surface of a vast religion/culture/way of life, the syllabus does not focus on key concepts that introduce and enliven your interest. Rather, in his passion for the subject, Professor Hawley feels that you must go into each item and its myriad aspects in detail – and you will be tested on that detail. He goes in for the hard sell of why you too should share his passion – promotion over attraction. The result is that what interest I had was utterly overwhelmed by the sheer amount I was being force-fed. I say this as I contrast it to 3000 and 4000-level courses (dealing with equally complex topics) that presented a far less convoluted structure and more digestible portions.
You will be far better prepared to take this course if you are Hindu or have significant prior exposure to Hinduism. I’d estimate that Hindu students made up about 40% of the class and others should keep in mind that they are graded in comparison to their peers who come to this course with a more advanced knowledge base. In addition Professor Hawley ranks east and west – finding the west in large part inferior. One example was in discussing funeral rituals and death, where he clearly felt that westerners did not have a good relationship with death. 
Lastly, while the course covers a wide range of issues touching on Hindu culture and India he refuses to directly address the question of caste, which obviously has a significant impact on the socio-economic past and present of India. It is unfortunate that he should completely ignore such an incredible teaching opportunity given the current climate in America where the discussion of what privilege is has become so vital. We are Columbia students; we cannot become good leaders by skirting around touchy issues. Adding insult to this, he did consider the western writer and thinker Henry David Thoreau worthy of lecture and reading time.
Things you will need to survive/do well in this course:
•	transcribe the lectures
•	a solid study group
•	use the teaching assistants
•	preferably have a prior knowledge of Hinduism

I was instructed by Professor Humensky for the Physics I and II cycle this past academic year. Unfortunately I cannot recommend him as a professor at this or any institution. An amiable enough guy, its clear that after 4 or 5 semesters of teaching that it doesn't suit him. Via reports from my peers who were with him during his first semester, back in the spring of 2013, he has made little to no improvement in his lecture style or the format of his course. Please note that I did well both semesters, receiving grades in the ""A"" range, so this is not the review of a slighted, disgruntled student.
Professor Humensky is unable to do what I feel is the most important job of a professor in the sciences: distill complex information from the text into meaningful, understandable ideas that the eager student can use to navigate problem solving. While lecturing, he stays exclusively to his prepared notes which he reads almost as if they were a script. Later, these notes are posted to courseworks; the language and structure of the notes, and thus his lectures, are almost carbon copies of the textbook. What's wrong with this? We already have the textbook, which of course we have paid an inordinate amount of money for. To sit in lecture where it is read back to us, equations derived in turn with little additional explanation, is a disregard for the value of the instruction that should be expected. I had a hard time understanding the ideas in the text, as many students do. In an ideal world, lecture is able to help decipher what seems on first read to be a foreign language, but instead I was left to spend excessive time finding quality instruction via youtube videos. The interesting thing is that quality instruction IS out there, as evidenced by what I was able to learn with youtube supplementation of the text. Student questions in lecture were often met with the Humensky 1000 Yard Stare, as he was forced to grapple with the information himself instead of merely restating it to the class.
20% of a student's final grade is determined by weekly problem sets, which everyone has the answers to; in this way, your homework grade can only hurt. The other 10% is decided by mandatory prelecture quizzes on the expensive WileyPlus online learning tool, which also seems to only be able to hurt your grade. Humensky defends this meaningless 30% of your class grade by actually arguing for the utility of assignments that give incentive via their ability to hurt you. A student is only able to distinguish him or herself through the midterms and final. Here, Professor Humensky is mostly fair: you are allowed to drop 1 of your three midterm grades, and with one exception the exams were composed of 1.5 to 2 dot-level problems (difficulty scale per the textbooks) which were extensions of the ideas reinforced in the problem sets. The exception to this was the Physics II final exam, where he chose to put several 3-dot problems on the test which were not reflective of applications of the course material emphasized at any point in the semester. Two of the problems were taken verbatim from the textbook, I learned upon later review. If this isn't intellectual laziness, I don't know what is.
Professor Humensky is institutional failure personified. Again, I cannot recommend him as a professor at this or any university. It stands to reason that I cannot recommend his class. Consider all other options first and then be ready to find outside sources to supplement your understanding.

A great writer, an okay professor. Sam Lipsyte has a lot of valuable insights to teach about writing, style, characters, and connecting sentences. He gives a really good reading list and tells you about 'webs of writers' so that if you like a book or a story you can find others like it. Sometimes he's even funny.
But realistically, he doesn't take his job as a teacher very seriously. He says come visit him in office hours, says just enough of the right things so that how little he cares isn't completely obvious, but anyone looking for a genuine educational experience will immediately realize that his classes or students are not priorities for him. His lectures are improvised and meandering. He hardly gives any feedback on written assignments. He takes forever to answer emails.

This class is by far my favorite this semester (and maybe at Columbia). Prof. Schmitt-Grohe picked very carefully the materials she would like to convey to us and then went really deep into the models and its variations. Her pace is relatively slower compared to the other professors but I find her method instrumental in improving my understanding. I also appreciate the fact that she always makes an effort to make the materials come to life by bringing in data, her research, and current events. She does her best to make the class interactive to various degrees of success and in doing so engages you to think if you decide to participate. At the end of the day, the course exposes you to how great macroeconomists think and frame a problem, not just provide you with intellectual bonbons to whip out during dinner conversations - although her graphs and data helps with that too. This framework is super valuable if you are thinking of majoring in Econ or studying at graduate level since a lot of emphasis is on the logic. 
As previous reviewers noted, exams are not so straightforward, which seems to be most people's complaints. She doesn't really drop hints about what will be in the exams, but if you pay careful attention to the intuition behind her methods, read the slides carefully (these are super dense and rather tangential - most people give up on them but I find they really help you prepare for exams), and go to the TA review sessions, you will be OK. She spends the majority of her lectures doing the math, but the exams test you on intuition so be sure to understand where the math is going/coming from. The head TA comes up with practice questions in my section and most of the class will go crazy trying to figure out the answers, but you'll be better off understanding the methods and logic behind it rather than getting the right numbers. 
Her problem sets are weekly which could be a blessing or a curse. They are not super time-consuming but a little tricky at times. You can get away with copying down answers from a buddy, but if you want to feel prepared for the exams, don't do this. As previous reviewers noted, she doesn't let the TAs post answers for the problem sets, so either do them really well or go to recitations. 
The one thing that most of us seem to have troubles with is that she expects you to understand the material at a really deep level, since the amount of the material is not that overwhelming. Unlike the previous reviewer, I'm not bothered by the talk-and-chalk method (probably because this semester she started giving slides) but you will have to review both the slides and your notes on a regular basis to not fall behind. She devotes approximately 4-8 lectures per topic so it's in your best interest to keep up with the class and the slides - missing a class and not catching up will mean that the next lecture is torturous. 
She is also super helpful during office hours especially if you come prepared with specific questions - she is happy to go through some concepts again and listens to suggestions about how the class could be improved. 
All in all, really excellent class. You just can't cut corners - do all the work you are supposed to, be prepared to think a little deeper, and you will get a lot out of this class.

Usually it is the older professors, those who are so far removed from learning the basics of their area of study, that they can no longer remember how to convey that knowledge to beginners. Professor Wang, despite being very young, is one of those people.
This is not her only extraordinary talent. She is also a clairvoyant. She can assume any student's experiences. ""You will probably remember from your Physics classes..."" she said as she ripped off a quick formula in a blur of hand movement and chalk dust to the befuddlement of most of the class. All formulas and slides will equally fly through the student's consciousness. You will swear that you thought you saw her blink the information to you at some point -- ah, but 'did she really?' 'Was it a dream?' Truly, she is a great magician!
Professor Wang also knows your schedule. Can you come in every Friday for class this summer? Of course you can! She asked us, counted to three in her head, and then said, ""OK, we'll come in every Friday."" Most people had not even figured out their schedules in their heads yet, but it's no matter. She KNOWS you are free for class!
Perhaps you can talk to her during office hours and come to some decision about whether you should drop the class. Actually, she already knows that she is a great teacher, and no one would ever drop her class before the deadline, so she doesn't always show up for office hours. No emails or announcements on Courseworks are necessary to announce these cancellations, of course, because everyone attending Columbia lives on campus anyway, so what's the big deal, right?
Have you ever wanted your professor to answer a question that you didn't ask? Professor Wang will do that as much as you want. Ask her anything. She will interrupt you (she KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE THINKING! Spoooookyyyyy), and answer a long-winded, unrelated question completely generated from her mind. But you were surely going to ask that question anyway...you know it's true.
Professor Wang's greatest gift may be that she can talk you out of understanding concepts that you had previously mastered. It is truly exceptional. Had you used those concepts before without issue? Had you understood them completely? Be ready to be amazed because Professor Wang is about to blow your mind, and ""misanswer"" your followup questions when you become confused. I had yet to experience such a thing.

Professor Folch's class was one of the most challenging I'd ever taken at Columbia. It also had the strongest impact on my academic skills and career. He was knowledgeable and generous with helping students after class and over email. I generally found him to be respectful and kind (though he had a few colorful moments, to be sure). And hilarious, which is why I think most people in my class loved him (that, and the fact that his charm and beauty are pretty much unparalleled). His essay feedback was sometimes brutal, but always useful. And, as I suppose one might expect from a Classic professor, he harbored an intense loathing for split infinitives.
Professor, thanks for a life-changing academic experience that was, for the most, part a great one.

This was one of the best classes I have taken at Columbia.  It is a topics course on approximation algorithms, mostly for NP-Complete optimization problems, and there is a brief discussion of online approximation algorithms at the end of the course.  The emphasis is on the design and analysis of approximation algorithms, and some time is also spent on hardness of approximation results.  This is a definitely great class to take if you enjoyed Analysis of Algorithms 1.
Professor Yannakakis is an excellent instructor who has an unbelievable command of the material. He always has comes to class with a very well-structured lecture plan, and is able to give very thorough answers to students’ questions.  He also posts great lecture notes online, which are very helpful, as is the recommended textbook “Approximation Algorithms” by Vazirani.  For many of the lectures, he begins the lecture by introducing an optimization problem (or a family of closely related optimization problems) and then spends the lectures going through different approximation algorithms for the problem in increasing order of sophistication.  The class met once a week for two hours, and while these lectures were a bit long, it allowed for the material to be covered with a good amount of depth.  He is also very up to date with the material and able to put the results we cover in context, sometimes telling us about recent improvements from the past few months!  While some of the reviewers have correctly point out that he is not the most exciting lecturer, he does a great job of engaging students in lectures.  He is definitely one of the best professors I have had, and I believe he is by far the most underrated CS professor.
The homework assignments were some of the most interesting and well-designed that I have seen.  They are very relevant to the material that is covered in lecture and strike a great balance between rigor and accessibility.  Every problem is interesting and somewhat substantial and there are no boring filler problems.  I definitely had a great time working on these, though I suspect it would have been much less enjoyable had I left them till the last minute.  We were given a good amount of time for each problem set and I recommend taking advantage of that.  For the last month of the class we had a research paper instead of problem sets, which required to write a 10-15 page paper on a relevant topic of our interest.  The assignment is pretty flexible and I thought it was a great experience, especially since none of my other CS classes had a similar assignment.

3 Homework Assignments were worth 60% of the grade and the 10-15 page research paper was worth the remaining 40%.  We had at least 2 weeks for each of the problem sets in addition to 4 no-penalty late days.

Augustin is super-friendly and probably one of the nicest professors in the CS department. Everything else about this class is mediocre or stinks.
You’ll basically learn how the internet works at each layer of the stack. There’s a large discrepancy in the level of understanding imparted via lecture in class and the level of understanding required to do well on the homework and exams. His Comic Sans slider are also sans of deep material. They basically cover the textbook at a highly abstracted level. I just read the slides for exams which turned out to be a big mistake.
Augustin is more than willing to go over concepts again for you and answer all your questions. However, he’s too accommodating and ends up not finishing the lecture since he wasted time answering a bunch of not-so-great questions. It would also have been nice if he went over some topics in detail (though he expects that kind of detail in tests)
Logistics for this class were a mess. Homeworks and exams took forever to be graded. We had Piazza but didn't get responses for 4-5 days at a time which was frustrating right before deadlines. The TAs were also generally not helpful. HW questions were often poorly worded. The exam is just a bunch of hw questions put together.
At the end of the course, you’ll have some idea of how the internet works, but all the material could have probably been covered in a third of the semester. I felt like I didn’t learn enough and that a lot of the classes were wasted.

Disappointing class. I've never had a CS class I dreaded more than this one. A lot of the content of the course was super interesting but it was totally lost through the lecturer. Vovsha's slides were confusing and his classes were extremely boring. Yes, he had maybe two interesting classes where in showed the ""magic tricks"" but that was about it. I attended every single lecture and tried to be on my A game but his powerpoints were convoluted and his explanations were even more confusing. The class was painful. I tried seeking out extra help through the TAs of the course (generally CS TAs are incredibly helpful and patient). But every other day we would get emails informing us that the TAs would unexpectedly cancel their hours. Like COME ON. (I'm also a TA for a bio class and I've canceled my hours before but every other day is excessive). Also, I've been to multiple TA sessions (I've sometimes woken up at 7AM to make the 8AM session) only to have the TA NOT SHOW UP. SERIOUSLY??? This class was just so incredibly frustrating. Lastly, I do not find Professor Vovsha to be a kind or helpful professor. I went to the review session for the final and I remember asking a question about an intermediary step and why it was necessary. He didn't answer my question and he was extremely condescending. He made me feel so dumb in front of everyone in the review session. I've never felt that way before for asking a question and it prevented me from asking any more questions during the review session.

I want to start with reviewing the TA's; they're useless. They put on a facade as if they're willing to assist however they are completely focused on their future endeavors. One of the TA's said and I quote: ""do what you want I don't care, this is my last semester here."" They have demeaning conversations about students that aren't performing up to par WITH the professor while laughing and pointing at them. Zero professionalism. Zero care. The rubric was inconsistent and Anna does not audit the TA's for consistency nor does she explicitly state what's expected of you and your reporting. I received one bad reporting grade and that set me straight. 
Professor Ghurbanyan was not concerned with your understanding of the material. Was the professor fully adept? Absolutely, but that will not preclude you from failing nor does it ensure that instructor will ensure that they instill a modicum of knowledge into you. Anna was more concerned with her image with her TA's as she granted them full autonomy. Anna was smug and it was quite comical to behold. It was good practice to be amongst my polar opposite, to aspire to be a better human than a relentless robot. Was she amiable? Absolutely, while she spoke negatively about you behind your back. 
The workload was extremely excessive, it's to be expected but not when the expected knowledge is outside the scope of the class. You can spend hours reviewing lecture notes, reading the files and resources, doing 100's of problem sets and still be dumbfounded by the quizzes and grading. I escaped unscathed with an A but I constantly applied pressure on the TAs. You will need to bleed them of all their information. I realized that they're all, Anna included under the impression that the students are dolts. Aren't they there to ensure that the information is comprehended? It's not as if you're taught the mechanism and then asked to apply it, no, you're taught general principles and are asked to derive theories. The course is organic chemistry lab,  not a PHD program. Who is running that asylum? It seems as though the reviews have yet to be taken into consideration by the Columbia faculty because the common denominator is the Anna. This course was horrible yet it had the potential to be outstanding IF the course objectives were clearly defined and adhered to, and if arbitrary questions on exams and grading were omitted, as far as personality traits, you can't teach class (double entendre).

Workload:
Extremely labor intensive on every level. You must constantly recharge and condition your mental and emotional state in order to survive this course. You will spend at least 20hrs a week on this course and that's just on prepping for quizzes and completing prelabs.

Having Prof. Shohamy as my Mind, Brain, and Behavior professor was a good experience. She is a good lecturer and she clearly knows her subject material. To succeed in her class, go to every lecture and take good notes on what she says. Her powerpoints are often sparse, so be sure to listen to her vocal explanations. As Prof. Shohamy says, you don't actually need to read the textbook to succeed in her class. If you take good notes, then everything she says is all you'll need for the exams. If you don't understand a concept or a particular graph in her slides, then you can always find it in the book chapters. Overall, a non-stressful class. She usually finishes her lectures 10-15 minutes early too, so that's also nice. There are plenty of extra credit opportunities, so take advantage of them! I find that her guest lecturers (often TA's or other researchers) are often more confusing than she is, but still manageable.

The class for me was pretty split. Professor Van de Mieroop was actually wonderful. He's incredibly knowledgeable about the material, his lectures are clear, straightforward, and focused, and he's also very enthusiastic about the material. If going to lecture every day isn't your thing, you also luck out because Van de Mieroop wrote the textbook for the class. So he doesn't cover anything in class that's not already in the textbook. It's a great Global Core class to fulfill requirements and you can avoid going to class and just reading the textbook if that's more your style. 
The kicker comes with the discussion sections, which was a new addition to the class. Discussion sections basically go over various primary sources that were either briefly mentioned during lecture or have to do with the time period discussed in lecture. Part of your grade in the class depends on your participation in the discussion section, and that really depends on the TA you get. Personally, by TA was wonderful, a fairly easy grader, and was really enthusiastic about encouraging people to speak. But I also heard close friends with TA's who weren't helpful, were tough graders, and didn't help them in the class. Unfortunately, that's a toss up and you're just going to have to hope for the best with that. 
Overall, a really simple class, not much you have to worry about. My suggestion would be to talk to your TA and really get a sense of their teaching and grading style so you can ensure that A.

This class was a blessing. First off, Professor Curley is a wonderful professor. This is a subject that he knows extremely well, and it shows in the way that he sets up his lectures. He explains everything succinctly and clearly and presents exactly what he wants you to get out of the class. He's also in the habit of showing a lot of videos during class to supplement the material which  is extremely helpful considering that understanding social development becomes a heck of a lot easier when you actually watch experiments being done. 
He posts lecture slides in advance on CourseWorks, and they are incredibly detailed and helpful. He highlights important material, he summarizes long-winded paragraphs from the textbook in a mere sentence, and he goes at a reasonable pace. He also does helpful review sessions the classes before the midterm and the final including take home points from each major topic on the exams. He truly wants everyone in the class to do well and doesn't try to set his students up to fail. 
Workload is simple. One research paper that he gives you ample time to accomplish, and the topic is your choice. One midterm and one final that are entirely 3-4 sentence short answers. The textbook for this class is really detailed, but can at times be rather long-winded and in depth. Looking at the slides from class is enough to get A's on his exams.
Overall, an easy informative class.

Everyone kind of sits on the continuum between weeding out people, and helping them learn. Professor Pe'er is definitely on the latter. Here's why:
1) Only 80% completion of your homework is required, i.e. an 80% translates to 100%. Now, I'll caveat this by saying these assignments are done weekly for the first half, and some of them are pretty tough if you weren't paying careful attention in class.
2) Feedback, feedback, and feedback. Every homework assignment you turn in gets notes meant solely for you. Your final project will have presentations, and you will get feedback from both classmates AND the professor and/or TA, each time.
3) A steady/reliable pace with a very welcoming attitudes towards questions. He leaves his cell phone, personal email, and allows skype sessions over the weekend - just to help you learn or get help with your project.
4) Cameron (the TA) is super nice and adopts the same attitude as Professor Pe'er - he only wants you to learn.
In addition to that, this course is heavily front-loaded - it's going to be a sprint the first half. I can't speak for everyone else, but I really appreciated this - it gave me more time to work on my project (the last half of the semester), and deal with the impending deadlines for all my other classes.
Now, some caveats:
1) His lecture style is pseudo-interactive, or at least tries to be. He asks a lot of questions to check comprehension, and there were plenty of awkward moments where nobody answered a very obvious question (albeit, I'm not sure if it's because we were all scared because it wasn't obvious at the time or because nobody cared. Likely the former).
2) I see other people complain about his voice, his stuttering, blah blah, but if you're interested in the material, then you'll likely pay attention naturally (and you should; it's interesting stuff).
3) The material -can- be hard to follow. It's -a lot- in roughly 2/3rds of the semester. Some of it is almost hand-wavey. This is especially true if you've never had exposure to genomics, or even biology. That being said, I came in here with 0 biology background, and was okay.

Sahar has by far been one of the best teachers not only in my Columbia experience but in my entire life.  Hyper-intelligent, always well-prepared, Sahar always awes me with the depth of her preparation for each class as well as her ability to adapt to the natural and spontaneous changes in the course of student-led conversations.  I was impressed by her ability to (seemingly intuitively) balance the principles of seminar, allowing students to engage in a conversation together, with the goals of good teaching, also stepping in and providing guidance and instruction at the appropriate moments with thoughtful opinions and questions.  She also asks really thought-provoking questions that helped me think about the texts we read in a new way!
In seminars, group dynamic is so important.  I don’t think I was just randomly blessed to have a great seminar group: I think that Sahar’s teaching techniques contributed to the supportive, interesting conversations that we had.  She really obviously cares about each and every one of her students.  She is supportive in class and her comments on our papers were usually thorough (sometimes she acknowledged that they weren't and invited us to office hours, in which she is also very helpful).  She is a tough grader but her high standards made me a better writer and encouraged me to work harder.  
I think by the same rule, her class expectations were really high—we only cut one text (Faust), which we replaced with 2 others (Excerpts from Ibn Hazm's ""the Ring of the Dove"" which is very short and Tony Morrison's ""Beloved"") whereas I know other teachers cut many, and we definitely never had like ""movie day"" or anything; but her high expectations pushed me to actually read, learn, and ultimately feel incredibly accomplished at the close of the course.  
I really tried to get the readings done most nights but I think Sahar also makes it pretty accessible even when you haven't read.  She is great with asking guided questions about specific passages and referencing (with page numbers) specific parts of the book, so you can still participate and respond in class.  Sometimes we split up into small groups in class and looked for information/themes in the books, which was tedious, but at the end of the day it was great when you hadn't done the readings :)
While I don’t think that anyone in our seminar completed all the readings on time, Sahar was ALWAYS prepared and engaged for every text we were expected to read.  She is SO thoughtful and thorough, I am impressed by her ability to prepare so well for each and every class.

One of the best!  He's funny, competent, charming, and super approchable if you ever need help.  I know he had some health issues this semester so classes were canceled pretty often (like, more than 4 times) which was fine with me, but we still managed to finish the entire course book without any stress or cramming at the end of the semester.  The course was accelerated, but unlike Accelerated Elementary it was a lot less grammar, and we spent many days in between just talking about French movies or watching French news or something.  Samuel is a stickler about pronunciation (especially gender agreement) and overall I think my pronunciation improved a LOT in his class.  In-class worksheets are very helpful and I always felt like review was pretty thorough even though the course moved very fast.  We had short homework assignments on a nearly-nightly basis, which I did pretty rarely, so I got really good at answering on the spot in class.  It never seemed to be a problem, which is great!  Because of the nature of Intermediate French I, the first part of the semester was just review of Elementary French II so that was a really nice time.  Even though the second half of the semester was harder, Samuel is a more than capable teacher who makes class a joy.  After having taken French since September and feeling really nervous for my second intensive semester, I was so impressed by my own ability to discuss more complex news stories, movies, and longer writings in French—progress I credit mostly to the lovely professors I've had.  Overall, Samuel is great and I would recommend him 100%!

Fun class, manageable workload, great professor, interesting topics and no textbook. He really encourages people to ask questions in class so do take advantage of his willingness to answer questions, no matter what other people think of them. Do learn some linear algebra and R beforehand. All programming assignments are done in R. As well, he strictly requires people to hand in pdfs for written assignments, and since it uses a lot of math, it's worthwhile to learn LaTeX. Also, be aware that this class is usually populated with graduate students mainly from the Statistics Department, so if the midterm or final is heavy in math and stats calculations or proofs, you will need to nail those tests or else get beaten by the curve. Also, TAs are helpful and often provide hints on Piazza, so look forward to that.

As another reviewer mentioned, if you didn't enjoy your previous Calc course, he will make you enjoy math again.

Great Professor, however there were some issues with the class. One of the TA's was constantly scanning the back of the classroom for people using their computers inappropriately or falling asleep, and her behavior was extremely distracting. Another issue I had was just with general housekeeping issues. Professor Pflugfelder didn't go over the syllabus in class which contributed to a number of misunderstandings. We were told to expect an average reading load of 50-150 pages per week- however on the last week of class the workload practically tripled with no warning whatsoever.  There was nothing on the syllabus to suggest this because one of the assignments was an entire work with no indication of how many pages it contained. Additionally, I was left a little pissed off after I purchased materials that were later provided on courseworks for free. 
As a whole though, despite having no real interest in the subject matter and only taking the class because it was the best of the remaining global core options I had available to me since I had to register late, I feel positive about the course. I felt that everything was graded very generously and Prof. Pflugfelder is kind of hilarious.

Anne Holt is great. If you get assigned to her section for Lit Hum, you're going to love the class (which I can't say is the case in most other sections). She takes the time to talk to everyone about their essays/assignments, knows a lot about the texts we read in class, has a sense of humor (seems insignificant, but is surprisingly important in a class like this), and understands that life sometimes inhibits things like completing assignments right on time (to a point, of course). She'll do a great job preparing you for the final, and is a very fair grader overall. 

Workload:
The workload isn't really bad, there are the standard LitHum essays + online book discussion posts (remember to do these, and try to read through some of the ones other people post). The posts are what you will all discuss in class the next day, so as long as you at least half-try you'll have something to say in discussion.
Participation in class is important! If you're a naturally shy person and really don't like talking in front of people, make sure your discussion posts are great (but still try to talk in class every now and again).

As opposed to most of my friends, this class was a nightmare (and I'm an English major so it was somewhat terrifying to see the subjectivity involved with what I thought would be my favorite Core class). Ms. Wang, while a great human being and extremely intelligent, can't explain anything and is an inept teacher. 
The prompts were never fully explained, a rubric was never really given, and guidance in any direction was never given at all. If you prefer that to structure, his might be a good class to take, except that even most free-form folk need to know what it is they're expected to write about. The problem is, the attempts at explaining the prompts were more confusing than the prompts themselves. A majority of the class was at a complete loss as to what to do/what was going on. Discussion involved three people spouting absurdities and everyone else trying desperately to understand what was going on.

-begins every class with a lecture, though occasionally experiments with entirely student-led discussions. 
-described the quality of one of these student-led discussions as ""mediocre""
-as a previous reviewer mentioned, his lectures could be a little unclear/completely nonsensical, although they got better as the term progressed.
-sample quote from lecture: ""Judith butler would say you can't know whether this is a water bottle."" (from a class on hobbes)
-likes machiavelli, and augustine, although plato is his favorite.
-doesn't like ""jargon."" thinks that words like ""ideology"" and ""heteronormative"" are jargon. 
-used the c-word in class while reading a translation of a bizarre and very explicit letter machiavelli wrote about having sex with a prostitute (purpose of letter-reading was somewhat unclear, might have simply been to demonstrate how funny misogyny is).

When I took this class, I was overwhelmed with the amount of information presented in every lecture. But you know what, getting an A in this class is possible. People, this is not a joke class, so take it seriously. Don't slack off. Come to class; make sure you go to recitation. Also, pay attention to the stuff in the review sheet (especially for finals). The TAs were great this semester. If you have questions regarding the essay prompts, e-mail/meet with them.

Here's to those of y'all who will sign up for this class, don't attend (or watch) lectures, and expect an easy A: Vincent will crush your hopes and dreams worse than raisins left in the fucking sun. 
The reviewer below me has done a good job delineating the grading scale...note that a 94 is the hard-cutoff for an A. The Spring 2015 class was curved to a B. The last time I took a class that was straight up curved to a B (ahem, Mowsh bio), less than 30% of students ended up with an A- or higher. 
That being said, this class is a hell of a lot more straightforward than Mowsh bio, though the information presented in his lecture slides can be overwhelming, especially now that the exams have gotten more difficult and any small detail can be tested. I remember exam 2 straight up had a vocab quiz of words such as ""iatrogenic"" and ""nosocomial""...if you memorized that particular slide or had a knowledge of Greco-Latin roots or remembered your SAT flash cards, you'd ace that section. If not, it's gg. Your best bet to ace-ing this class? Don't skip lectures and tell yourself that you'd re-watch them; it doesn't work, and then you'd end up further behind. Also, flash card the fuck out of every little detail. Start with the lecture questions and then come up with your own. Don't do what I did and start studying the night before/morning of the exam...there are only 3 exams, no drops, so each exam covers roughly 8 lectures, of almost 60+ slides per lecture (and boy, does Vince love putting text on slides!). My grades improved with every exam since I started studying even a day or a weekend earlier, but my only oh-so-slightly-above-median performance on Exam 1 wasn't enough to offset the 97 I got on the final, and I ended up with an A-, even with the extra credit. Unless you want to feel butthurt (like me), I'd take every exam seriously. I can guarantee that if you put in the effort, there's no reason why you won't be able to get at least a B+ in the class. The question is: is this class worth the effort?
Also, Vince does deserve some accolades. He's a pretty darn good lecturer, possibly one of the best in the department (up there with Mowsh XX, Mowsh XY, and Liz Miller). He's super passionate about his field, entertaining, and clear in the presentation of material. If you're awake enough in his lectures, you'll be sure to pick up some neat stuff.  
Workload:
3 exams, each 30%. Lecture quizzes that are worth 10% that can be postponed until the last day of class (I wouldn't recommend it). We also had an optional extra credit assignment that was worth up to an additional 2% of your grade. Since everyone is doing it, it's probably in your best interest to do it as well. So much for optional.

Oh God. As a recent Barnard alumna and sociology major, I feel like the best thing I can do to give back to my alma mater is write this review and hopefully prevent another student from ever taking this class. This review only applies to Professor Rieder--other professors have taught this course, and from what I've heard, they have been good lecturers. However, if you are considering taking Professor Rieder's course, STOP now. I took Culture in America during the  fall semester of my senior year. As a sociology major, I needed to take just one more sociology course to complete the major requirements . Because I hadn't taken a 2000 level class yet (yes, this devil class is 2000 level, I don't know why), I chose Culture in America. I thought ""I'm a sociology major, I've taken like 8 seminars, written 25 page papers,--this whatever lecture will be a breeze!"" I was wrong and naive! This class is not sociology- it is a cluster f-ck. I can't give you a lot of detailed info about how difficult the midterm and final were--I don't know because I withdrew (the smartest thing I have ever done, probably). As another reviewer said, I was dazzled by the positive culpa reviews--during his first lecture, he was so eloquent, so smart, etc. Listening to his class is like listening to a lecture in a foreign language you have a vague familiarity with, like you've heard it in a foreign film with sub-titles before or something. It sounds really pretty and you wish you understood what was going on, but you have no idea what is going on. He often threw out crazy terms on the board and never unpacked what they meant. Before taking this class, I didn't even realize you could throw the prefix ""neo"" onto so many words. He assigned basically a whole book a week, and sometimes wouldn't even discuss the material in class. Also, I can't afford to buy this many books. I can speak confidently that his tests were monsters and made about as much sense as his lectures did. Do with this information what you will. Don't even bother PDF-ing it, because you will have to put more effort into that ""C"" then you can even understand right now. 
TLDR; DON'T Take this class. Withdraw if you already have. Pray if it's too late.

If you've worked in a research lab before and want to understand the basis behind a lot of the techniques you've been doing (DNA extraction, ChIP, PCR), you should definitely take this course. 
Jenni Punt is a fabulous lecturer, also one of my favorite's in the Bio Department. She's genuinely interested in having her students come to understand the material and her approach to learning isn't just stuffing you with textbook facts from Alberts but also includes placing certain scientific advancements in their historical context and discussing experimental applications of these techniques. 
Unfortunately for Jim Manley, he has to teach the second half of a class already bedazzled by the wonders of Jenni; that's probably why I think many of us find him to be *a tad* more uninteresting. While Jenni covers DNA, Jim's work is on RNA, and his lectures mainly involve copying/pasting figures from Albert's (and occasionally from other sources) onto the powerpoint. I found his lecture slides to be entirely incomprehensible without attending lecture, so be sure to do that. His pacing can be erratic, as some topics take unnecessarily long for him to unpack, and he breezes through other things (like rRNA processing) which did end up becoming an exam question. 
Both Jim and Jenni also love asking those ""pondering"" questions that involve class contribution...I found them to be quite enlightening, as they helped me see many different approaches to a particular problem, even though they oftentimes may have been looking for a particular answer.
Bottom line—this class is definitely worth taking, and I believe it was curved quite well. No reason to not succeed if one keeps up with the material, as is the case with any other upper level bio elective. 
Also, Darpan and Leila were both fantastic TAs and deserve a shoutout.

The review from January 27, 2012 is spot on about Wiggins as a person.  I would even go a step further and say that his behavior around students is completely unprofessional and often insulting.   Furthermore, I found his seminar to be a pathetic excuse for a course and I think requiring it is a complete waste.  
The entire “course” is centered around presentations, most of which are given by the seniors in the course.  Each senior is responsible for one 75-minute presentation of a topic of their choice, and that’s basically the entire course.  When you are not presenting you are expected to show up and watch the other presentations (or play around on Facebook) and perhaps ask a few brown-nosing questions to the presenter if you are in that kind of mood.  
He also invites in several of his own presenters, and this seems like mostly self-promotion on his part.  They all seem to go out of their way to mention what a mentor Wiggins was to them when they were students at Columbia, or something absurd along those lines.  Most of the presentations were very boring, and I can honestly say I have never been in a classroom with so many students on Facebook during class.
Wiggins spends the entirety of most lectures sitting in the back of the room and typing emails on his phone.  He will often look up and attack the presenter with questions in a rather adversarial manner.  He seems to go out of his way to nitpick and tear you apart for not following his (often unwritten) rules, and he does not do this in a constructive way at all.  
I really don’t know how I was supposed to benefit from this class in any way.  It honesty seems like this is Wiggins’ way of dealing with his teaching requirement without having to prepare any lesson plans.

Workload:
As a senior you’re expected to show up twice a week and give one 75-minute presentation.  As a junior you are expected to show up once a week, write 5 short feedback tweets for presenters (140 characters each), and one 500 word essay on what you learned from the class.

WARNING: THIS CLASS IS NOT AN EASY ""A""
If you're looking for a fun, easy-going, basic anatomy class. THIS IS NOT THE CLASS FOR YOU. I initially took this class expecting it to be fairly basic in terms of the anatomy and more of a dance-focused, movement-based class. I simply needed a less intense class to take for the semester to balance out my harder classes. The amount of knowledge that Prof. Hidaka expects you to memorize and learn for the semester is rather intense. I Pass/Failed the class, thank goodness, but I felt bad for the students who didn't think to do the same. 
Now, if you're interested in studying physical therapy or sports medicine, I would recommend this class. You are expected to know the insertion and origin of a plethora of muscles and to spell things correctly from memory during exams (as well as a lot of other things like bones, tendons, joints, etc.)
The day-to-day class structure is pretty calm and can be relaxing and sometimes fun, but if you don't keep up with the readings and memorizing a little bit each day, studying for the exams will be KILLER and TORTUOUS. Each class is usually 1/3 or 1/2 lecture and the rest of class is doing some sort of movement. There are even some days where you'll be doing some kind of ""movement class"" and simply following along with an instructor. Those days are nice, very relaxing.
*Note: There's usually a lot of partner exercises where you have to ""feel"" another person's muscles or joints, so if you're not comfortable being touched or touching other people's arms/legs/hands/feet, then steer clear of this class.
This class is pretty easy to pass if you Pass/Fail it and do all of the weekly writing assignments, extra credit assignments, and make a good grade on the group project.

Augustin is super-friendly and probably one of the nicest professors in the CS department. Everything else about this class kind of stinks.
In this class, you’ll basically learn how the internet works at each layer of the stack.
There’s a large discrepancy in the level of understanding imparted via lecture in class and the level of understanding required to do well on the homework and exams. His Comic Sans slider are also sans of deep material. They basically cover the textbook at a highly abstracted level. I just read the slides for exams which turned out to be a big mistake.
Augustin is more than willing to go over concepts again for you and answer all your questions. However, he’s too accommodating and ends up not finishing the lecture since he wasted time answering a bunch of not-so-great questions. It would also have been nice if he went over some topics in detail (though he expects that kind of detail in tests)
Logistics for this class were a mess. Homeworks and exams took forever to be graded. We had Piazza but didn't get responses for 4-5 days at a time which was frustrating right before deadlines. The TAs were also generally not helpful. HW questions were often poorly worded. The exam is just a bunch of hw questions put together.
At the end of the course, you’ll have some idea of how the internet works, but all the material could have probably been covered in a third of the semester. I felt like I didn’t learn enough and that a lot of the classes were wasted.

Professor Johnston is one of the most enthusiastic teachers I have ever had, and is certainly a good fit for this intro class. She is extremely approachable and helpful, so do not hesitate to her ask questions or ask her for advice about the class material or anything else related to astrophysics. 
The material can be confusing at times, but never too challenging, and Kathryn does an excellent job of breaking down the different topics and relating them to other parts of the course. Her lectures usually consist of Powerpoint presentations, with breaks here and there to write out proofs or do examples. This course is usually one of the first courses students take in astronomy, so it provides some background material and a basic understanding of concepts in astronomy that can often be used in the more advanced astrophysics classes. Kathryn's excitement about the different lecture topics often showed, which made the class more enjoyable. She does not drone on in a boring fashion, but rather keeps an upbeat sentiment when discussing everything. 
The most disappointing feature of this class, though not a worrisome issue, was the grading. Kathryn was a very picky grader, so you might lose a point or two on each problem unless they are thoroughly thought out. Ultimately, this was for the better, and helped provide a deeper understanding of the material. The grading was not super harsh, but do not expect an effortless A either. 
Workload:

Jay is great as far as CC lecturers go. He is responsive, thoughtful, and overall a 10/10 human being.
tl;dr: You're far better off taking his CC class than another's. You don't have to do all the reading to get something out of the class, exams are easy & straightforward, papers don't have to be difficult. As long as you try, you'll be fine. Jay recognizes effort.
Class:
Before each class he'll send out discussion questions; this helps cut down on the reading if you read selectively. For the first half of class, he'll give a brief overview of the important points, and also sometimes show relevant multimedia. Then he has you pair up and discuss for a few minutes, then opens it into a class discussion. He usually takes the last two minutes to recap and offer his feedback & thoughts.
Jay is a good facilitator. He really seeks to give all students in the class a chance to speak, but never forces anyone to talk either. Participation is 3/7th of your grade, so make sure to say something every class. He takes REALLY meticulous notes every class about who raised their hand, who spoke, what they said, who brought notes. He once told me the exact number of times I didn't speak in class and the dates of those classes. Jay doesn't expect anyone to say something revolutionary; as long as you bring a few quotes that interested you and not speak complete bullshit, your participation grade will be fine.
Papers:
I've heard people say he's a tough grader, but I've never had a problem. Start your paper on-time/early. Then you'll have time to go to his OH and get feedback. He gives a lot, and is willing to read anything you've written up to that point. He also likes a very specific paper style/structure. Clearly state your claim in the beginning of each paragraph. Follow every quote with background & analysis. Don't use passive voice. Be straightforward. He'll usually grant you an extension if you ask.
Exams:
Very straightforward. He allows you to have a 8.5x11 cheat sheet, front & back. You turn this in with your exam. He gives you a list of possible ID sources beforehand. He also gives a list of 7-8 possible essay topics, with 4 of them on the actual exam. On the flip side, because you're allowed to bring a cheat sheet & you get the essay topics beforehand, he expects you to use quotes (paraphrased or not) & cite them in your essay. Review the main points, have your quotes ready, and you'll be A-OK.
Misc: This is not a hard class as long as you put in effort--and usually, you'll want to. I hated CC the first few weeks of school, and it ended up being my favorite class. I've left every class having learned something new. He truly cares for his students. He's the first instructor I've actually been excited to go to OH for. He does this activity at the end of every semester where he has you write your future self a letter, and he sends it to you in a year. Also, he does a giant Pisticci brunch every semester, paid for by CC. You won't regret having him as your CC instructor.

Musatti's a really sweet person, with an Italian accent that you'll either find endearing or annoying, but alright as a professor. Just alright. This is one of those classes that if you just study the textbook and not go to class, you won't miss a thing (except stories of her personal life).
Lecture is pretty straightforward. However, most classes she'll only cover half of what she says she'll cover in the beginning of class.
She does have some pop quizzes in lecture, but they're all more or less ""collaborative"" (aka you take them with the entire class, including her) and she drops the lowest one.
Problem sets are easy, sometimes badly-worded.
The midterm is easy. Final's definitely tougher though. This is partially because Musatti's good with Micro (the second class she teaches), but pretty bad at teaching Macro, which composes more of the final. Don't think just because you did really well on the midterm that the final will be as easy.
Recitation is helpful, but not necessary. I didn't attend a single recitation (except to pick up the midterm) and didn't feel like I missed anything.
I had never taken a single Econ class in high school before this, so I worked harder in this class than most people probably did. If you know any Econ beforehand, you'll be so set.
I agree with previous reviews that say if you want a good grade with little work/stress, take Musatti. If you actually want to learn (and also struggle with your grade), take Gulati.

Definitely take him for Macro. He's funny and it's not difficult to get an A. There are loads of TAs, and they're usually all great, so it's never hard to reach one if you need to. Go to a recitation near the end of the semester if you can; usually one of the TAs goes over what will be on the final. If you miss a class or don't have notes, all the TAs post their recitation notes every week and some of them have really great, comprehensive ones. Plus, he spends the beginning of each class reviewing last class, so again, not a problem if you missed a class.
Problem sets aren't difficult, just pretty long and occasionally tedious. There's also lots of past solutions floating around and he hardly changes the questions, if you want to go down that route.
Exams are straightforward. When you study for an exam, make sure you check their notes, as they'll sometimes cover stuff that Xavier doesn't, and then shows up on the exam. Also make sure you review your problem sets--past questions will also sometimes show up. Be warned: his exams are long af. You will be scrambling till the last minute to finish. The midterm is pretty difficult, but the final is more forgiving. Plus with his grading policy, as long as you do well on the final, your midterm doesn't even matter.
There's pretty much no math involved, so if you suck at math (like me), that's great news.
Overall, I enjoyed his class. I learned a lot, and he's humorous enough to keep your attention for most classes. Some of the more critical reviews below though do have some valid points, i.e. pacing, but I personally didn't have a problem. For the most case, you'll have a good time. If you don't like him, just don't go to lecture & go to recitation instead.

Xiangwen Zhang is a decent professor. Yes, his accent sometimes makes it difficult to understand his words. However, I don't think that really detracts from his actual teaching abilities. He's very clear & thorough with his explanations. Of course, since this is a math class you can get by without going to class and just reading the textbook, but I often found his lectures were more helpful than the textbook.
Problem sets every week, usually assigned weeks before they're actually due. No WebAssign (thank goodness). Usually not that long & not a lot of work.
His exams are very straightforward. He has practice exams on his website, and almost identical problems show up on the actual exam. Also, if you only go to one class per exam, go to the review sessions. He'll give answers to the practice exams, but he DOES NOT put them up online. If you don't go to the review, you're not going to have answers. As long as you go over your problem sets and the practice exam, the exams shouldn't even register as a problem. 
He really does want his students to do well. The class bombed the first midterm, avg 21/40 (which made absolutely no sense to me since it was literally the practice exam with different numbers). He adjusted the second midterm so it was much easier and everyone did much better.
This isn't a hard class, and again, you can always teach yourself from the book. Would definitely recommend.

tl;dr: Gamber as a person = humorous, witty, all around a good guy. This class was a nightmare logistically and impacted the experience, but that was mostly beyond his control and is probably a one-time thing. More Global Core than English, great books, really tough paper, reasonable exams (though my opinion on the exams seems to be an outlier).
Gamber's funny, knows his shit, isn't afraid to call people out on their bullshit, etc. He has flair & timing, so his delivery of his lectures were always great.
The selection of books is great. I really enjoyed most of the novels, and managed to finish all of them because I genuinely wanted to.
As for the class itself: a lot of things went wrong for it on the administrative side, unfortunately. They couldn't find enough TAs for the class, so mandatory recitations were cancelled. Because of this, the entire grading system had to be changed. Gamber was really frustrated by this; you could tell that this was not the way he wanted to teach the class. He believes lectures are the worst way to teach a humanities class, but he ultimately got stuck teaching a class that could only be a lecture. I think this definitely damaged what the class had the potential to be, but I also don't believe this should reflect badly of Gamber, when it was out of his control.
Lectures would usually start with background on the novel. Then he'd pull a few quotes related to whatever theme he was focused on, dramatically read the quote, and discuss the theme more. This class did feel more Global Core than English at times, as some previous reviews have said. He focuses much more on cultural/social/racial/gendered themes that were semi-obvious than actually analyzing the text and the language. Still, I learned a lot, even if it didn't exactly deliver as an *English* course.
The midterm was ridiculously easy: ID 3 of the 5 given passages and explain how it ties thematically/stylistically to the rest of the book. Basic stuff.
The paper: damn. Grading was really harsh. I can't tell if this is just representative of the TAs or if Gamber told them to be so rough. I've previously had Gamber for Lit Hum and he was easier on grading so, not really sure about this one. I regret not visiting the TAs more for help with the paper, I'm sure it would've helped me loads more. He gives you a list of pretty varied prompts, or you can come up with your own as long as it's cleared with him/the TAs.
Also--make sure you follow his instructions for the paper. Gamber was raging because 15% of the class either 1) didn't hand in the paper on time 2) didn't hand it in in the right location 3) wrote on an unlisted topic without getting it cleared. He then said he was going to give that 15% a 0 for not following instructions, no exceptions, effectively failing them. Not sure if this ever happened (I sure hope not). Either way, I still wouldn't even want to face the threat of this.
The final: I know previous reviews all have said the final was a bitch, but I didn't have much trouble with it. If you read all the books (and this wasn't a problem for most people I know in the class) and have a firm grasp on the themes, plot points, etc, it wasn't too difficult to discern which passages were from what books. It definitely wasn't easy, but it wasn't horrible either. Again, my experience may have been the exception on this.
I agree though, that the midterm/final probably weren't great assessments of how much we actually learned/gained from the class. That probably was what the discussion sections went towards, but since they were cancelled, there was really no way for Gamber to gauge that for everyone in the class. I'm also pretty sure he thinks exams are stupid ways of testing, so he just didn't give a shit about the exams and basically tested on reading comprehension.
Despite how weird it was this semester, I'd still recommend taking the class. Hopefully it'll be better in the future & discussion sections will be back in place.

If you're taking this to fulfill your science req: DON'T. This class has taken off so many years of my life.
tl;dr: Olsen seems like a good guy, but the class is absolutely awful due to the irrational grading. I was bored all the time and only went to class because of the pop quizzes. Only take this class if you actually like dinosaurs and have stellar cramming skills because the amount of information you're expected to know is fucking ridiculous. 
Class: He has iClicker quizzes most classes. Thankfully, he grades for attendance, not correctness. Even if your answer is wrong, you'll still get full points for just being there. He'll put up his slides online before each class. You can usually tell if there'll be a quiz that day if there's a slide in the powerpoint that's completely blank (he leaves the slide blank, rather than deleting it from the powerpoint). Take notes - once you finally start learning about dinosaurs, the slides are all pictures, no info or text. He likes to show dino movie clips a lot and talk about how they're inaccurate, so if you're into that good for you I guess. He also has lecture notes up from the early 2000s somewhere online, and they haven't changed much since. They're very useful if you can't be bothered to pay attention.
Homework: These were truly, truly awful. The instructions for each would be terribly vague and unclear; you would have no idea of how you were to go about it, what to do, and what the TAs wanted. I lost so many points because I didn't do something that the TAs were looking for, but that would never be mentioned in the instructions or class. Thankfully, there were only 3 and they ultimately don't count for much, but it was still super frustrating to see so many points docked for such trite things.
Research paper: Oh god. This motherfucking paper was a nightmare for so many people. Again, there was the issue of an incredibly vague topic, unclear examples, so once again, no one knew exactly what they should be delivering. They give you a long list of possible topics, but that doesn't mean you're safe. Originally, we got a rewrite that would account for half of the final paper grade, but so many people got fucked over by the shitty instructions and shitty grading and complained to Olsen that he decided to have the rewrite completely replace the first draft grade (after sending a condescending email on how to write a hypothesis, which was stupid because that was hardly the problem. The problem was the incredibly unclear instructions). One of the TAs was useless, the other was helpful & basically told me what to rewrite (probably because she was tired of dealing with unhappy students). However, if they were just clearer from the beginning (providing a partial sample paper, even) about what they were expecting, none of this would have been such a problem in the first place.
Final: This is a whole 'nother beast. You have to know so much fucking information, it's 99.9999% impossible. You have to know a list of 30-40 important dinosaurs/other ancient creatures, the time period they lived, where they were discovered, why they were important. You had to know several cladograms, be able to label a dinosaur skeleton, around 20 famous dig sites, and other misc. info on geology, genetics, dinosaur anatomy, and on and on and on. Thankfully the practice final was pretty close to the real final, but it still sucked.

tl;dr: This isn't a easy class if you have no compsci experience. However, if you insist on learning Java, Blaer's the best class to take. Problem sets are a bit of a struggle, exams are reasonable.
Blaer's a fun guy. He's down-to-earth and isn't pretentious. Expect a lot of tangential stories though. There are a lot of TAs, and they're for the most part helpful. Recitation is usually staged more of an OH though, they take questions & don't really have a set plan. You must go to the first recitation--that's when they go through how to set up pico so you can actually code, and it's a million times easier seeing them do it in front of you than trying to read the tutorial.
If you're like me and go into the class w/o knowing any compsci, you're going to spend the first few classes going ""what the FUCK is going on."" Be good about reviewing notes and reading the textbook though (and doing a lot of googling), and eventually you'll catch up.
Before each exam he'll usually go over what will be tested. Make sure to go to at least one of the TA's review sessions--they'll usually cover something a little more comprehensively than Blaer. Exams are decent. Often I just read & reread the textbook and that was enough. The final covered way more content, but to make up for it it was also easier. 
Also, use Piazza religiously. Questions are almost immediately answered and any question you might have will probably already be up there.
An A is definitely doable, no matter your past experience; you're going to have to put in some work & effort though.

Best mechanical engineering professor in Columbia. Period. Cares about his students, and makes certain that no one is left behind in every lecture. He even told us one of the final exam's questions so we could work on it at home! 
It doesn't happen very often when intellect meets clarity, but all will experience those qualities in every lecture Prof. Narayanaswamy has to offer. I highly recommend Arvind! It pains me that he doesn't teach more classes-take and prioritize every class he has to teach!!
His notes are also extremely well thought out. All of them are organized neatly and uploaded on Courseworks. Given his extraordinary organization and delivery, students have only themselves to blame if they do less than well in his class.

QP 2 was not bad in terms of material or workload. The classes were delivered clearly, if at a slow pace. However, Barclay Morrison is the rudest professor I have ever come across at Columbia. He shows very little respect towards his students, especially through email and during office hours. He is not interested in helping us learn the material. 
For instance, I emailed him because wanted to discuss my exam, and in his reply, he asked if I had done all the reading and if I could do all of the HW problems cold. If not, he wouldn't waste time discussing my grades. His attitude and demeanor towards his students is totally inappropriate.
Additionally, the lack of answer keys for HWs/exams was detrimental to our learning, and did not prevent cheating on exams.

Professor Somerville is extraordinarily knowledgeable. He speaks articulately and strives to answer students' questions as thoroughly as possible. Still, he is honest enough to say ""I don't know, but I will try to answer as best I can"" when students want to know about something that is not very familiar to him. He is poised and direct but has a very dry sense of humor that can be truly delightful. He isn't cold or unkind, but he rarely smiles, so that, every time I achieved a smile (through hard work and my own rather dry sense of humor) from Professor Somerville, I felt truly rewarded.
I don't know what the TA situation is going to look like in coming semesters. One TA was bright, engaged, and kind; the other was cold, rude, and bored. If you meet the TAs and feel strongly about one or the other, even based purely on instinct, try to take a discussion section with the one you like. As in any class, this can really make a difference as the semester moves forward; I dreaded my discussion sections because I did not listen to my instincts.
Finally, I would like to say a word about other reviews here, because a lot of them mention that Professor Somerville is boring - or at least that the topic is boring. My earnest advice to anyone thinking of signing up for this course is to take thorough notes, review them comprehensively, and ask Professor Somerville or one of the TAs (again, preferably whichever you like best) about any topic that seems confusing to you. The material is only boring if you enter the class thinking, ""This material is going to be boring."" I advise any prospective student not to think that way: enter with an open mind and let yourself get excited about the richly complex history of the Christian religion.
Workload:
There are two midterms, both of which do require scrupulous study. Again, take notes and review them more than once.
There is one final, which is not agonizingly hard if you prepare well for it. Look at your notes and (re)read the material that Professor Somerville assigns (yes, do your best to read all of it. There are a lot of books he insists upon, and I don't believe you will have to read every last paragraph in order to succeed, but you should try your best to do so.) My class received a study guide before the final, and I found it invaluable. Make sure to show up to class on that day!
As indicated above, there is a great deal of reading. The reviews before mine don't lie about the enormous amount of literature to which the class is exposed. This is, naturally, both a blessing and a curse; it is fascinating material but there is a lot of it. Again, don't push yourself too hard, but read as much as you possibly can: it makes a tremendous difference. You'll be solidly prepared for both the lectures and the tests if you keep up with the reading.
Finally, make sure to attend the (mandatory) tour at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine when the time comes to study religious art and architecture. Our class was led by the Reverend Dr. Andrew C. Blume, who was dynamic, witty, and articulate when he guided us through the cathedral. Professor Somerville asked students to compose a one-page response to the tour, citing the topics that most intrigued us. The paper was not graded but every student had to submit it. Make sure you're there.

I had a completely different experience from the person below me....
If you're looking for an easy class or expect to spend your time sitting around talking about 'Land Before Time' then this class is NOT for you. I know a lot of my classmates took this class expecting an easy A, but this is not a ""rocks for jocks"" class.
Professor Olsen is EXTREMELY knowledgable about all things dinosaur related, but he also incorporates general principles of evolution and climate change into his lectures. His lectures did tend to be a bit ""dense"" and 80% of the material he discusses in class was not on the final or useful in writing the term paper. However, he ALWAYS tells you what is going to be on the final and even discusses what aspects of each lecture might make a good term paper topic. With that in mind I completely disagree with the reviewer below me. If you can't think of a topic for a term paper in this class then you're just not paying attention or weren't showing up to his lectures. I got an A+ on my term paper and didn't have to do rewrites...'Professor Olsen also gives you a giant list of possible topics. If you can't thin of one just choose one (there's literally over 30 given to you).
I chose to take this class along with the lab and I highly suggest to do the same. The labs are run by the TA's and correlate with the lectures. I learned more in depth information from the labs than I did from the lectures. Also make sure to go to office hours! The TA's offer them on various days and they are beyond helpful! I was one of the few students who weekly went to the office hours (mainly for help on my labs) and there were rarely more than four students there. (note: none of the kids just taking the lecture went to office hours... which is why a lot of them did so poorly)
In terms of the final... it was tough to study for. Professor Olsen expects you to memorize a ton of information. However, he gives you a list of the dinosaurs you need to know and the cladograms. It's a lot of cramming that happens the week before the final, but it's totally doable! He also gives you a practice exam and 90% of the questions from the there are on the final. I got an A on the final and I couldn't tell you any of the information that I studied. It left my brain immediately following the exam, but just cram and you will be fine.
I got an A in the class and I really do NOT feel like it was that difficult of a grade to achieve. I got an A+ (Yes a 100%) on my term paper, which I spent time researching and chose a topic that actually interested me. You get to choose whatever you want for the topic and I think the freedom in that was wonderful. If you have issues choosing the topic then Professor Olsen was always available after class to ask and the TA's were always AVAILABLE at office hours. The person below me clearly didn't utilize the resources available to them.
Bottom line- Your grade represents the work you put in. If you're looking for an ""easy"" A then I suggest taking another class. But if you're willing to put in the work then getting an A isn't that difficult. This is Columbia you should be capable of doing work outside of each lecture and not just expecting to coast until the final sneaks up on you.

ALOT if you do the lab, but the labs are extremely easy to get A's on. You get to do rewrites of each lab and resubmit for a new grade (it's averaged with your first attempt)
Lectures: GO TO THEM! He gives random iclicker tests that account for your participation grade
Homework: is vague and definitely ask the TA's for help. Also there's only 3 assignments so... actually put some effort into it
Term paper: so easy. Seriously you could write about how 'Jurassic Park' inaccurately depicts dinosaurs and get an A if it's written well
Final: Take good notes in lecture and cram the week before. It's tough but doable
Note: I did NONE of the readings (didn't even use them to study) and got an A...

This was the best class! Professor Mims is extremely knowledgable on all things art, but she also creates a wonderful atmosphere that I have yet to experience in any of my other classes at Columbia. She lets her students discuss the art in whatever terms you feel comfortable with rather than lecturing, which was really interesting. It also let everyone feel welcome to add to the conversation regardless of how fluent you were art terminology. Professor Mims definitely lead the class and steered conversation, but everyone would talk to each other rather than just spouting off information at her. We also went on two ""field trips"", which were extremely interesting and informative! We went to St. John of the Divine and got an extremely comprehensive and unique tour of the cathedral (we even got to see parts that are off limits to the public tours). Almost everyone in the class did well and I don't think anyone got below a B (the majority of students got A-'s I think). 
If you want to learn about art, how to discuss art, but mainly how to interpret art using the skill set you already have then definitely take art hum with Professor Mims!
Workload:
Easy!
Every other week you have a LST (Look, sketch think), which involves going to a museum and drawing a painting, sculpture or other piece of art and then writing about it. You do all of this on a blank sheet of paper. It's really easy and there's no ""right answer"". You get full credit as long as you turn it in.
Midterm: super easy! You have to be able to ID the art we learned in class, but professor Mims send out power points with all the art you must know. You just have to know the name, place it was made, medium (marble, oil on canvas, etc) and the decade it was made. Memorizing the mediums was hard, but I know a lot of other art hum classes where they had to memorize the exact date and other unnecessary facts. You also have to compare and contrast two pieces we looked at, which is easy. You can literally write about ANYTHING as long as your argument is cohesive you will get full points.
Two papers: The papers were really easy. The first one we were given a choice of three topics that all pertained to different art found at the Met. You have spring break to write it so it's really no rush. The final paper was a bit more abstract, you got to design your own gallery using art that we had looked at in class. It's fun and again there's really no ""right answer"".
Final: Same as the midterm except there's a section where you are shown a work we didn't look at in class and you have to make an educated guess on who the artist was. It's really easy and there were no surprises on it.
There's some reading, but most of the class never did it. It's an easy class as long as you are willing to participate and again there are no ""wrong answers"" when discussing the art.

You already know this lady is going to be the highlight of your FroSci life when on the first day, you see a happy woman with pink hair streaks. And then she assures your impressions by telling you all about her life and enthusiastically asking about yours. 
I love Dr. Smith. She made it an effort to make The Archive, which is like a free science bank that you and your seminar gets to share. Sure, it's extra work but it's really not that much. If you already love science, just tell the class about your research. If you are more on the humanities side, just pick anything you like that is remotely science-related. Without The Archive, I'd dread staying for a whole hour and 50 minutes in FroSci because of the content, but this archive helped relieve boredom. 
She may be a little hard to hear, especially when you have her towards the afternoon, and all you want to do is go to JohnJay or Ferris to eat. Grading kinda sucks when too lenient (but a plus if you have heavy workload) but having an extremely lenient grader takes away motivation to do well on hw and encourages you to just do ""you.""
Every midterm and final has a jeopardy which you should totally go to even if you can have it online. It'll help pick which ideas to emphasize on cheat sheet and all.

There are alot of negative reviews on here for budick, many of which made me iniatially apprehensive about signing up for his course. This was also the first college couse I have taken as I just finished the class over the summer of my senior year in high school but quickly my concern was cast away and i became captivated with Budick's lectures. If you want to really learn physics budick is the way to go. He was easily one of the best and quirkiest teachers i have had and his stories and lectures made the class especially interesting and even hilarious at times. 
Budick is however very tough to understand sometimes and I highly reccommend that if you are to take this class that you read the lecture slides he posts on courseworks before class. It is also necessary at times to read ahead; the class moves incredibly fast and if you dont go ahead youll be stuck behind. Before each exam Budick posts a series of practice tests online with his answers in the back. Often his work is difficult to follow but if you spend the time struggling through on your own first it will really pay off when you have to take the actual test.
If you are taking this course to prepare for the mcat he does cover topics that may be on the test.
I also highly reccommend that you consider taking the lab along with the lecture. Columbia has some amazing resources and it is well worth it to take advantage of them (it will also help you in the class).
Workload:
There is alot of homework for this class but it is not mandatory. It will help your grade though if you are stuck between letter grades, and it is good practice so you really sould do it if you can. The first week of class he pretty much told us flat out that if we want to do well this has to be the only thing we do for the remainder of the class. He reccommends that you spend an average of four hours a day studying and this is NOT an overstatement. Many of the concepts take time to understand and if you dont practice you will have difficulties. If you are a very fast learner it may be possible to have a job while taking his class but i would not suggest doing that.

With that being said I would highly recommend Professor Como to anyone that was either interested in East Asian Buddhism or needed to fill their global core requirement. For global core seekers Professor Como is a great lecturer and does a wonderful job of laying out the material in a way that emphasizes the key points which allow you connect the ideas. It was interesting to see that the development of a religion really is a logical progression once you understand the underlying factors that influence transmission of ideology. 
For people that are interested in Buddhism in general, Professor Como is extremely knowledgeable about the field(His wife's family is Buddhist and he will share interesting personal anecdotes which bring the material alive). When you begin the course he will tell you that one of his goals is to make the familiar unfamiliar and the unfamiliar familiar. I can say without a doubt that he works hard to deliver on that promise. As sad as it may be some teachers really do phone it in when it comes to their duties to educate their students, Professor Como is certainly not one of them.

This class was beyond what I was expecting, in a good way. Coming into this class, I didn't read any of the books on the list. The books are pretty dense, hard to grasp when just skimming or reading for leisure at times and honestly quite boring sometimes, but Professor Pedatella somehow makes all these books so interesting and intriguing like they're all his favorite books. He's definitely really knowledgable of all the books and many other things, super engaging in class (he actually made The Aeneid interesting to listen to) and pretty inspirational at times. I've honestly never had an English teacher as good as Stefan Pedatella, and my high school English teachers were all pretty damn good. Although he's amazing in the classroom, he is somewhat of a pretty hard grader; he really makes you think as well. I just felt like my critical thinking has grown quite a bit with Pedatella. He's also really approachable, especially during office hours but at times can be quite intimidating because he knows all these books inside and out and can really drill you if you don't have a solid idea. The workload of this class is manageable. I highly recommend it!

This man changed my life. He is everything you can want in a professor: he cares about the subject matter more than anything else. Sure, Beau's class has a little more work than other CC classes, but this is because he actually wants you to get something out of CC and philosophy in general. He actually wants you to engage with these texts. And, in my opinion, he 100% succeeds. There will not be a dull moment in his class. This man actually gets you to philosophize and WANT to continue philosophizing both inside and outside of class. Now that is something special, especially considering how much work we all have and the fact that most of us would probably rather sleep through CC. 
A lot of people (like the reviewer below) will probably complain about the workload, but honestly its not much because the work is NOT busy work. It is Beau's attempt to get you to philosophize. The weekly response papers are 2/3 pages of whatever the hell you want to talk as long as you relate it back to philosophy and the text.  And, for this reason, he is a generous grader and it is not hard to do well. All you need to do is engage with the ideas at hand and—more importantly—CARE about the ideas at hand. And, trust me, that will not be a problem because 4hrs of Beau's magic a week will make you care.

The scheduling conflict that made me switch into this section of LitHum is probably one of the best things that have ever happened to me. Professor Graham is extremely engaging and it’s obvious how invested he is in the course. 
The class is almost entirely discussion about assigned readings. What I thought was most helpful was how much Professor Graham listened— as in, he makes sure he understands what everyone says, rather than assuming someone’s point or steamrolling it into the ground. A third of your grade is based on class participation alone, which is pretty great.
He’s also a pretty funny guy, very approachable, and visiting him during office hours is great for developing any ideas you might have. On your two papers during the semester, he leaves detailed notes for revision with your grade. It’s literally advice on getting an A handed to you.
Pay attention to discussions and make good notes. I’ll admit that I didn’t complete every assigned reading, but since the class goes over thematic elements based on close passage readings, it’s easy to form your own understanding of the text if you're listening. But, seriously, participate.

Leah Lee Zander is pretty much amazing. She’s vibrant, enthusiastic and organised, and her class is structured to be as discussion-based as possible. My section was reluctant to speak up in class, unfortunately, but once everyone did, it made the process that much less painful. UWriting on its own is dry and unappealing, so the amount of energy Leah put into it formed the entirety of my interest in this course.
Leah is always enthusiastic about everyone’s new work, in addition to being very understanding and open. She expects everyone to adhere to her standards which she sets out at the start of the semester, but she’s very understanding when it comes to student-related stress. Just talk to her if you have any questions.

Prof Mehta encourages you to find your own voice and seek out your own interpretation and meaning in the material, which makes her a rare gem among the overly pedantic, egotistical English teachers that we all know too well. I wasn't interested in Latin American literature at all before taking this course but Prof Mehta made me fall in love with it. She's open to a more creative slant on assignments, and she believes in pushing you to find the beauty of the written word. She is one of the best professors I've had at Barnard and I urge you to take her course-she's one of those ""life changing professors"" that the Barnard recruiters were telling us about when they convinced us to come here.

I am about to say some things that will scare you, but when it comes down to it, you should take this class.
Daniel:
Daniel is an expert. This is both good and bad. It is bad because he will sometimes explain things as though we are all on his level, when really no one else is. Additionally, the homework problems can be very challenging and overly mathematical. However, Daniel is more than happy to answer any questions during lectures, so make sure to ask if something gets glossed over. Additionally, you will really understand machine learning after taking this course. I recommend that you print out the slides and take notes on them, as for me they were useless without commentary (because I am not on Daniel's level). 
TAs:
Our TAs tried really hard, but a few of them fell very short. They often could not help with homework and were unable to answer questions about exams. However, homeworks were graded fairly leniently to make up for this. I was fine with the compromise as I still learned a lot, though it was very frustrating at times when trying to complete difficult homework problems. The best thing was there were a lot of TAs and there were at least one set of office hours each day.
Homeworks:
Most homeworks involved a MATLAB component that was never too difficult, and was always my favorite part of the assignments. It was cool to actually apply everything and have a classifier that had a low error. Some people thought that these parts relied too heavily on understanding the tricks of MATLAB, but I always just had long runtimes and didn't bother too much with optimization. I never got points taken off for this. The written parts of the homework could be too mathy for me. Additionally, everything had to be typeset so you couldn't just write it out and then take a picture of it, which always added at least an hour to the write-up. 
Exams:
The first exam was extremely long. I don't think anyone finished early. It was tough but I think it worked out pretty fair with the curve. The second exam wasn't so long but I thought it was extremely hard. There were some questions that were straight linear algebra without even having an ML twist on them, which I thought was ridiculous as I had taken CLA 2 and a half years before. However, the curve on that ended up okay too and I think the curve overall was also very fair. I did put in at least 90% effort into this class, but I still ended up with a higher grade than I expected.
Readings:
There is a statistics textbook that I couldn't even read it was so over my head. However, the actual ML textbook can be very helpful and is great to read after lectures to clarify things. There weren't as many readings in the second half of the class and I pretty much stopped doing them after the first exam.
Workload:
I took this class with 3 other classes with relatively light workloads, so I found it to be very manageable. I would not recommend taking this course with more than 1 other class with a heavy workload. 5 homeworks, and 2 exams covering the first and last half of the class, both in-class. 40/30/30 distribution I believe.

This class is a great introduction into philosophical thought. I came into this class having no formal education in philosophy, and I learned a ton. His heavy analytic style may be a little bit frightening in that he mostly talks about ideas and arguments by organizing them in steps, which makes the entire thing a little less ""fun"" and a little more rigorous. However, he is an engaging lecturer, has a great accent, and is very helpful during office hours. I would definitely recommend this class to anyone unsure about whether to take it. You will finish with a very solid foundation in philosophical content and style.

If you Have Josh you have won the Music Hum lottery. He is awesome. Josh not only taught us perfectly all the facts and information of any music humanities course but did so with amazingly in depth conversation and analysis that was largely discussion driven and student based. We discussed topics outside the traditional music hum syllabus such as the implications of including a specific piece or style in the syllabus and what exactly the ""great works"" are and how they came to be considered as such. He constantly challenged and made us consider our framework and vantage point in music hum and more broadly within the core, and Columbia in general. While we were learning the basics of music theory it also felt like we were having important and fascinating conversations about people,society, history, and our perception of them. All of my other friends found Music Hum to be fine and doable but altogether underwhelming -- my class turned out to be one of my favorite thus far. 
Assignments were extremely clear, his expectations and the information we needed to know were all given precisely. I had never had any prior experience in music, and he managed to both teach me all that I needed to know with ease while not boring some of the more experienced students. 
He's also just funny and super cool.

Professor Baczewska is truly one of the best professors I've had in my four years at Columbia. I left Music Hum until my 2nd semester of senior year and was not looking forward to it. However, after taking Music Hum with Prof. Baczewska, my perspective on both music and Music Hum have changed dramatically.
Let me start with the Professor. She is a classically trained pianist who runs the Music Performance Program at Columbia. First of all, in class, she will demonstrate certain principals of music by playing piano. Even I, as someone who does not have an ear for music (despite years of piano and violin lessons), could appreciate how amazing her piano playing was. It is really quite rare that you have an expert practitioner at Columbia show you his/her skill with such grace and interweaves it so well with the lessons.
Also Prof. Baczewska is a very supportive and kind person. She really helped us through learning the songs and musical concepts in a very fun way. Very available via email and office hours and just a really great presence in class. She clearly loves teaching Music Hum and you will learn a lot from her. Also she really stresses discussion which makes the class more active. It is important to note that she will never let the discussion get too far off topic and will always make some to inject insight if the discussion gets derailed by tangents. She is a great discussion facilitator and just an incredibly wonderful human being.
The class itself is pretty aligned with the rest of the Music Hum curriculum. The one really cool thing though is that we had student performers come in for about 3 or 4 classes. Because Prof. Baczewska runs the Music Performance Program, she got a few different performers into our class (one on jazz, one on Ravel, one on classical music) which I thought was really cool for a few different reasons.
(a) You get to learn how talented some of your classmates are.
(b) Hearing music live from really high-level performers is definitely a different and more enriching experience than listening to it over the speakers.
(c) You get to learn more about how musicians play through and feel about the music they perform.
Anyways, I definitely would advise you take this class. It will not be your hardest nor your most time-consuming class (although, you definitely do have to invest some time). However, it is a very enjoyable class and one that will truly enrich your Columbia experience. I think the way Prof. Baczewska teaches the class is a real embodiment of what the Core Curriculum is supposed to be.

This is a class that has a very clear path to get a good grade. Do the readings, listen to the music, go to class, participate in class, think through the connections of the songs, and study for your exams. If you do that, you should do well in the course.

I had Prof. Mylonopoulous for Art Hum in Paris last semester and as someone who wasn't looking forward to this core class, I was shocked by how amazing this class was. I don't know if it was being in Paris or having such an awesome professor or a combination of the two, but I'm so glad to have had him as my instructor. He really cares about the students and encourages you to think critically. He makes it so easy and comfortable to talk in class, which helps because participation is so important in these smaller core classes. The syllabus thoughtfully integrated all of the resources of Paris and you can tell he spent time selecting museums and pieces throughout the city, even taking us outside of the city on trips to see some of the architecture pieces that we studied in person.
Class was not stressful at all, as along as you speak up and voice your opinions. He never made anyone feel stupid about their observations/interpretations, even though there were some out-there remarks. His accent is also charming - a combination of so many different European accents because he can speak so many different languages! Ioannis was cool. All I can say is take his class if he's teaching in New York.

     The course materials were wonderful. I found the texts to be well curated, which didn't surprise me considering Karen Green is a librarian's librarian. 
     However, she was utterly pedantic and condescending and not very professorial. There are ways in which her candor might have been something great. Perhaps if she were more relaxed or approachable, but not she lacked the academic acumen needed to teach at this university. 
     She incessantly did that annoying thing where she would ask the class something like, ""...and you guys know who Seymour Hersh is right?"" she would look at us. We would look back at her like we were so over this stupid game. She would continue, ""So, nobody knows who Seymour Hersh is? Wow! I can't believe you guys don't know who Seymour Hersh is? I feel so old. So, nobody?"" and on and on it would go. I mean this would happen perhaps twice a class period every single class. The worst. 
     She would begin each class with this utterly didactic diatribe about how she's god's grammarian, and how we're pathetic because we didn't use the subjunctive mood when writing something like, ""I wish that it WERE true,"" instead of ""I wish that it was true."" That was a fallacious example, she never said exactly that, but it was equally as annoying and trite. She would begin class with sentences like, ""I say this at the beginning of every year and nobody listens..."" I mean every student knows to basically stop listening to this person with a penchant for pedantry. 
     She hates being wrong.
     Classroom discussions were poorly facilitate. She took every opportunity to explain what things meant as opposed to letting us explore our own ideas. 
     She doesn't clearly outline on they syllabus what you're getting graded for. There's no rubric for the in-class presentation so you basically are graded on whether or not she liked you or your topic.
     She didn't like me, and well, I didn't care for her either.
     It wasn't all bad. Some of the discussion were good despite Green's best efforts, and also being able to meet her [comics world] famous friends was certainly a treat. And there was also this really cute girl who sat behind me.

Seth is a really smart person and a really good professor. He will take the time to read your essays thoroughly and cares (sometimes more than students care) about helping students become better writers and thinkers. He asks challenging and interesting questions in class. One of the best things about having Seth as a Prof is visiting his office hours. He takes time to talk through writing ideas, will ""hash out"" books with you outside of class, has interesting life advice, and is interesting to talk with. Some people thought his class time could get boring and his grading was too harsh but I disagree. I would take his section again in a heart beat. He deserves gold.

This was by far the worst class I have ever taken at Columbia. My biggest regret to this day has been switching into this class second semester. I will corroborate previous comments referencing his knowledge of course content but his efficacy as a professor unworthy of any praise. He is so soft-spoken to the point that students 3 chairs away from the head of the table will only hear indistinguishable mumbles. If you are so blessed to actually hear what he says, he provides explanations without any references to the text. Seeing as though papers and examinations are all take-home, you end up with a notebook full of notes, without any textual support. His grading is extremely harsh with minimal feedback and only question marks on the margins. He does offer to discuss papers before they are due but you basically have to have the entire paper written weeks in advance in order to receive any meaningful feedback. Finally, his course expectations are extremely unclear. For instance, he provides no feedback on weekly discussion posts, yet these posts are graded based on quality and content. As a result, you spend the entire semester trying to ask meaningful questions with no idea whether these questions are acceptable. Overall, his grading criteria for all aspects of the course lacked transparency and detail. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CLASS. Yogesh has the lowest A-range percentage out of any CC professor. Even if you want to learn philosophy or political theory, you won't learn anything here unless you spend hours and hours poring over notes and trying to comprehend his esoteric pedagogy. Seeing as though most students have 4-5 other classes to worry about as well, doing well in his class is nearly impossible without sacrificing time and effort for other courses
TL;DR: Yogesh is an extremely knowledgeable individual who is able to draw upon his expertise in anthropology but as an educator, he fails at every aspect.

Professor Martin is extremely kind and understanding - he's willing to give reasonable extensions if you talk it over with him, he does his best to give advice during office hours, and he's definitely not the kind of professor to grill you if you admit that there are somethings you don't know. He did grade rather harshly during the fall semester, especially on the first paper. Most people got B's and C's, but his grading gets more lenient as the semester goes on; I'm sure it's just his way of pushing students to work harder in a class that they'd usually slack off in. The first paper made me realize, ah, I should probably go to his office hours for help - and his office hours were a LOT of help. Just come in with a few ideas beforehand, don't be totally unprepared, and he'll push you to think differently about your ideas, to go further with them, and he's also really good with teaching you how to analyze the text (I found that it was really helpful when I got to talk to him one-on-one about analyzing the words and then examining how they work together). You probably don't want to ask him for as much help as I did (I'll admit that I'm kind of a pain-in-the-ass when it comes to asking teachers to help me with papers), but he was very nice and understanding about it all. 
Professor Martin's way of teaching LitHum was also quite different from other classes, in the sense that he was very interested in discussing marginalized voices (women, foreigners, the poor, etc.) both by characters in the books, and by the authors themselves. You can notice that there are several important recurring themes that he likes to focus on - the permanence of art, marginalized voices, suffering leading to wisdom, etc. (They're more specific and detailed when discussed in class, but these are the general ideas). He also like to do ""Food for Thought"" presentations - basically, one student presents on a passage that we read for the week, and also brings food.
tl;dr Professor Martin is helpful, nice, and intelligent, and it IS possible to get A's (or at least an A- if you put in the effort) but his class is NOT an easy A.

He drops the lowest quiz grade.
Fall semester has 4 increasingly longer papers, and spring semester has 3 explorations (short papers exploring a recurring idea) and 1 final paper tying the explorations together. There's also a creative project, a midterm, and a final in both semesters. Midterms and finals don't have Passage ID because you've taken the quizzes (and I definitely prefer the Passage ID being on the quizzes because you remember more after recently finishing).

Dr. Bartos is basically all kinds of nice. Did his best to be helpful, was friendly, approachable, certainly not the type to yell or call you out. I dozed off a few times in his seminar and I felt so terrible about it, and he was probably secretly judging me on the inside, but he never said a word about it. 
It must be so terrible for a genius like him to teach a course as basic as FroSci. I mean I liked FroSci for being a class I could relax in, but it was so terribly boring.

Professor Baumgartner was a good teacher. We all understood perfectly the material that we were meant to be learning, and often had interesting conversations about the pieces. The only downside is that she is very soft spoken and at times the class felt slightly flat. However, if art is a topic you are naturally interested in, the pieces and her guiding analysis of them were good.

The midterm and final included memorization of names and dates of pieces and the ability to answer analysis questions about them, and then two guided essays -- one on a known piece and one on an unknown piece. Three essays throughout the semester. Grading was fair.

Professor Schmitt Grohe delivers a rigorously mathematical approach to macroeconomics--she certainly does not make economics seem as easy to chew as does Professor Gulati.  However, if you have appreciation for the mathematics of things, you will find this class extremely inspiring.  She is not as skilled with the more tangible elements of economic thinking--she won't delve into the human nature or the intuition of things all too often.  Instead, she assumes that you already understand the intuition behind, say, why inflation increases the interest rate, and thus she does not take the time to explain it.  Instead she will prove the mechanism using strict variables.  
Personally, I loved this class.  But it is certainly not for everyone, particularly people who intend to take a more humanities or even historical approach to macroeconomics.  Each unit centers around models, and the models build in complexity throughout the semester.
Exams will test you on simplified versions of the models presented in class.  If you do not have a solid intuitive and mathematical understanding of the models, the exams can be very difficult.  I believe it is this reason that exam results for our class were often bimodal.

Professor Pedersen changed my entire attitude toward the Core. After several lackluster Core professors, I had almost given up on getting the kind of Core education that I had dreamed about when I came to Columbia, but Professor Pedersen completely renewed my hope in the Core. In her section, I was able to dig into (very difficult) classic texts and really understand what they were saying, and actually discuss deeply with my classmates what it all meant.
The section was really discussion-based, which was great. Professor Pedersen was really good at moderating the discussion and getting everybody excited enough about the texts as to participate in class. She also sometimes broke us into smaller discussion groups to talk about various important points in a text, and then we would come back together and go over all of them as a class, which really helped my understanding.
Professor Pederson showed us constantly that she really cared about our education and that we were getting the most out of the CC curriculum. As I realized partway into the class, she's a named professor of the Core, so she has a deep interest in making the class the best it can be. She always wanted to hear feedback on her teaching style, the selection of books on the syllabus, and the general method of CC instruction. She also knows every single book on the syllabus inside and out, and can (being a History professor by trade, not a Philosophy professor, remember) discuss so knowledgeably any of the books that it will astonish you.
Be advised, Professor Pedersen has extremely high expectations for the course. Hers is not a CC section in which you get an easy A--you really have to work for it. There were times at which I got really frustrated with how easy my friends' experiences in CC seemed in comparison to mine, and how much harder I had to work to get comparatively lackluster grades. But ultimately, I think it was definitely worth it, and I did pull out a respectable grade in the end. I learned so much in this class--and so much that I can actually remember, since it didn't just go in one ear and out the other--and it left me with the kind of education that I'd been craving in all of my Core classes previously.
Professor Pederson completely deserves the gold nugget CULPA gives her, and, her high standards notwithstanding, I would jump at the chance to take any class with her again.

Kathy's ArtHum section was a great one to be in. It wasn't as easy as some sections can be, but Kathy made it really interesting and interactive. She is a veritable fountain of knowledge about art, and did all of her lectures without notes, start to finish, and without even any filler words or seemingly having to think hard to remember what she had to say.
She put an emphasis on participation as an element of our grade, but all participation was voluntary: she didn't force people to talk who didn't want to talk, but did encourage everyone to take part in her Q&A discussion style every once in a while.
The papers made you think and were sometimes a bit challenging to write, but if you put a decent effort into them and she could tell you'd thought deeply about the topic she'd give you an A. As for the readings, I didn't do any of them except for when she told us we'd need them for a paper or the final, but I got by just fine.
One of the things I really loved about Kathy's section was that she created assignments that forced us to go independently to all of the major art museums in the city--the Met, MOMA, the Guggenheim, and the Frick--as well as places like St. John the Divine. Even though I often felt like I didn't have the time to spare for these trips, I always found that spending a few hours in an art museum on a Saturday morning was really fun and helped me refocus and de-stress (not to mention being educational).
Overall, great section, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking to get a solid education out of ArtHum.

U.S. Intellectual History was a super interesting class. As a history major, I've done a lot of history, but I'd never really looked at the history of ideas as they flowed through the events that happened, so it gave me a cool new perspective on why things in post-Civil War American history happened the way they did.
Casey Blake is a great professor. He really knows what he's talking about, and always made a point to include interesting little things in lecture to keep the class alive (as--and he admitted this himself--it could get a little dry sometimes). He was also really kind and helpful in office hours, interested in helping students refine paper topics and re-explaining topics from lecture.
The readings in this class did get a little long and were sometimes kind of dry, but the only way you could succeed in this class was by actually sitting down and doing them. If you hadn't done the readings, you weren't able to follow what was happening in lecture, and you also looked like an idiot in section (where, because they were so small in size, it was impossible to fly under the radar). But actually getting through all of them did, in the end, make me a better and more educated person.
The TAs were REALLY nitpicky when it came to writing, and would count you down on both papers and exams for spelling/grammar errors, structure, and word choice as well as ideas. This could be really annoying, but since it happened to 99% of people, it was pretty much fine in the end.

This was a pretty terrible class. The material was boring, the professor was bad, and the TA barely spoke English.
It was at 8:40 in the morning, which made it extremely hard to focus, since it was pretty dry material that Anthony's infrequent jokes didn't help much.
It's clear that Anthony knows a ton about statistics, but he in no way knows how to break it down for low-level classes. He was constantly stumbling over his words, messing up simple concepts, and writing things wrong on the board, which made it extremely difficult for someone with no stats experience to get what was actually going on. He also mainly used PowerPoint slides to teach, which meant that he sped through the lesson way too fast, since he didn't have go even write down one step at a time of any example problem he wanted to show. The one day the projector broke and he had to slow himself down and write problems out on the board was the one day I actually understood something in lecture.
Anthony also had real trouble engaging and controlling the class. His efforts to be a nice guy made it impossible for him to rein in the people starting to leave 5 minutes before the end of lecture (he usually got desperate and, not knowing what to do, just looked around wildly and declared that he guessed class could be done now), and also made it impossible for him to get anyone in the lecture hall to answer any question he would pose (leaving him awkwardly standing at the front as we were silent).
I ended up just having to re-teach all of the lecture material to myself outside of class, which was really time-consuming and didn't work very well. At the end of the day, I Pass/Failed the class because I wasn't able to teach myself enough of the material to be able to do well.
For anyone who isn't required to take this class for their major, I would give it a hard ""don't take.""

History of the South was a really interesting class. It gave me a view of the South that I'd never seen before, and Professor Fields definitely made an effort to look at all sides of a lot of issues--not just spinning the popular interpretation, as many professors do, but really positing her own deeply thought-out conclusions about things. She was a pretty intimidating woman, though, and didn't really invite people to question her interpretations or to participate in any sort of discussion.
The readings were generally very long, but usually fascinating. Discussing them in section was usually one of my favorite parts of the week, especially because my TA, Lindsey, was THE best TA I've ever had or will ever have. Lindsey knew the texts inside and out and really knew how to explain the complicated issues that Professor Fields didn't get into in class. She also required us to turn in multiple stages of our final paper ahead of time, which made me much more time-conscious on the paper and made for a much better paper in the end. Lindsey's line edits on our papers were also priceless.

Orlando is awesome. He wants you to take the material seriously but doesn't want to impose his own views, so he will consider, accept, and happily discuss any interpretation you care to give of the reading. 
Super flexible in terms of deadlines and other logistical matters, he just wanted you to think about what you were writing and see if you can glean any new interpretations from the material.

For Linguistics Majors (yes we exist): This class might be the chillest way to get through the language contact requirement. There's weekly readings of somewhere between 20 and 60 pages, all interesting. McWhorter facilitates conversation well, but you sometimes feel it's a 50/50 split of academic discussion on sociolinguistics in America and hanging out with him.
Notes to others (often American Studies people): There's a lot of underlying linguistics stuff in the readings/discussion that AmerStudies people in my section found to be new, but it was definitely nothing insurmountable. 
I found that the mixed crowd of linguistics and Amer studies kids brought a richness to the discussion.

I would recommend this class, but with caution. 
The clear bright side is that Carol Rounds is an awesome professor. She explain hard concepts (all of which border on grammatical witchcraft) in Hungarian well, although the inherent difficultly of Hungarian grammar makes this a difficult class at times. 
I would immediately recommend this to any person in Carol's Hungarian language classes, as it's good review of what you've covered and good prep for what your about to see. (I saw the past tense in this class before I saw it in Elementary II.)

This course is absolutely fantastic for anyone who wants to improve their Russian language skills - particularly their speaking ability. Because of the small class size, you have plenty of opportunities to speak, and a lot to speak about. The class includes reading short stories, writing essays, working on the finer grammatical points, speaking frequently about your life and experiences, as well as reading the news in Russian and discussing the headlines. Alla Smyslova is an incredible professor - she is constantly energized and passionate, but she is also very caring and considerate to her students needs and abilities. She has a real methodology for teaching grammar that works really well, particularly for difficult topics like verbs of motion. I would highly recommend this class to anyone who wants to improve their Russian Language over the summer -- it will be a challenging class, certainly, but it will also be immensely rewarding.

Professor Muir is fantastic. She presents what can be very dense, complicated material in a way that is clear and compelling. The course also makes you rethink how the economy or finance even work---especially in non-Western contexts. It's essentially an exploration through the topics of value, money, and risk of economic anthropology, and the whole point is questioning what major economic concepts we throw around everyday actually mean and how they are informed by the society we live in. 
She's also extremely approachable, and even held our seminar in her office with tea one time. I completely disagree with the review that said her presentation of readings was superficial and that she was pretentious. She's one of the least pretentious professors I've encountered and tries hard to make sure discussion is open and that student concerns are addressed. At the end of the course, she even asked us specific details about how we would improve the course.

This is for Bilgrami's language course. I'll separate this into PROS and CONS.
PROS
Bilgrami's class is very interesting if you are very interested in philosophy and/or very interested in linguistics. The texts can be challenging sometimes but Bilgrami does a very good job in explaining them (he has a tendency to mumble early on but finds his groove after 10 minutes of lecturing). It is indeed a fascinating look at some of the more interesting open questions about language (how do meaningless sounds become meaningful communicators? is language inherent or learnt? can we fully understand language without fully understanding cognition?). Its definitely the sort of course which you come out with more questions than answers, but I do believe this is healthy. It's also cool that Bilgrami is very opinionated. Philosophy is about debate and Bilgrami doesn't just lecture you about the texts but provides his own insights about when he does or does not agree with something.
Faculty-student relationship was very good. Robbie (TA) held regular office hours and gave very helpful pre-examination revision lectures. Bilgrami's OH were upon requests but (unlike previous reviews) I found him very inviting of student questions and dissent. He does indeed still arrive 10 minutes late but will hang around for a few minutes answering people who approach him. 
CONS
There was a very large amount of miscommunication between TA and Prof. For example, Professor makes a point in class that Robbie disagrees with. Robbie insists on our revision session that we shouldn't mention it in the midterm as it was just a side note that's contentious to begin with. I don't mention it and Prof. removes points from my midterm. When I talk to Robbie about it he seems to backtrack and gets flustered when I press it. That aside, it generally felt like there was little leeway in terms of answers. The final incentivised us to agree or disagree with parts of the prompt but it still felt like picking between two canned responses. 
Together these created a perfect storm of poorly written exams. Strict expected answers but confusion (even between TA and Prof.) about what these expectations are supposed to be. So grading just felt like a black box and I never really understood why I got the grade I got (Bilgrami never explains his ticks and crosses other than a few brief comments written in an unintelligible scrawl). Which doesn't mean I got a poor grade (they were reasonable and even lenient to those who improved), but it definitely sucks out the purpose of even grading us in the first place with such a lack of transparency. 
Workload:

Pro: 
Prof Morrison is an okay lecturer and explains things okay. The lecture experience is pretty average. He uploads slides on Courseworks and assigns readings. I didn't find the textbook too helpful or necessary. Most of his slides borrow heavily from the textbook and the only time the textbook was really necessary was for the homework True / False section. One thing to note is that he gives pop quizzes so you must come to class if you want to perform well on the quiz section of your grade (explained below).  
You probably have to take this course if you are looking this up. I root for you, BME major. You can complain about this class with your classmates to befriend them. 
Con: 
Not sure if this is a con but this class was, at least in my experience, memorization based. If you memorized the homework answers and practice problem answers, it is likely you received a high mark. This may or may not work in your favor. 
Exams are a huge time crunch. Morrison expects you to have memorized everything when you get to the exam. He expects you to be able to spit out whatever you have memorized and just be done with the exam. If you have to ""work through the problem"" instead of spitting out what you know, it is likely you ran out of time. That said, the exam difficulty is on par with your average homework question. It was just a time issue. 
NO ANSWER KEYS FOR ANYTHING. Office hours are obviously crowded. He gives ""practice problems"" before each midterm. (They are most likely recycled homework problems) Again, no answer key for this either. He has the TAs hold a review session that is just giving out answers to a few of the practice problems and/or homework problems. Usually it is very rushed very little time for questions. If you want to ask a question to clear up a concept, you can email or ask during office hours. 
I found this professor to be one of the worst experiences I've had here with a professor. Though his lectures are fine, he is not personable. He is intimidating and approaches the student with a ""well did you read the textbook"" attitude. I felt like I was wasting his time every time I went to his office hours. I would just interact with the TA's if I were you. 
tl;dr: Average lecture/textbook based class. Memorization based. Exams are a huge time crunch. Prof is condescending. 
Workload:
Reading: He assigns a lot of reading and if you want to do really well on quizzes, you need to do your reading (at least read ahead in the slides). However, I found the material covered in the homework and exams drew mostly from his lectures. Some homework questions were not in the slides and needed to be looked up in the textbook (or Google) 
HW: 6, none dropped. Difficulty varies. Usually 10 T/F questions from textbook and 3~4 questions similar to what was done in class. Some were easy others needed an hour or two of office hours. Each homework is 100 pts
Quizzes: Pop quizzes usually one per homework assignment. I think the grading is by point value in the overall HW and Quiz category but I'm not sure. Each quiz is 10 pts
Exams: 2 evenly spread out. 20 multiple choice and 2~3 short answer. Question difficulty is similar to that of the average homework problem. Main issue here is time. There is a ridiculous time crunch. If you know everything perfectly, you should breeze through the exam (with probably no time to spare). Thus if you struggle with anything, haha good luck.
Final: Similar to the exams in difficulty. Slightly longer--but you have 3 hours instead of 1 so the time to question ratio works out better for the final.

Not to toot-my-own-horn, but I've published in peer-reviewed journals and social science publications.

A lot of the class is, what I perceive, as high level stats and other math. I really had a hard time understanding the details of the course and could only grasp vague concepts. Luckily, things are matlab based and not proof based--it is possible to work things through since the class is application based. However, the theory behind things went over my head and I found myself either dozing off of just simply confused. 
The exams were tailored from apparently the reading but if you knew the questions from the practice exam and the general concepts from the slides, you were set. Exam difficulty is easy to medium. Grading seemed pretty fair to me. 
The professor is very amiable and I found him easy to talk to. He is responsive to student workloads and requests. He also explains things well when asked. 
The TA (Jason) was generally helpful but sometimes had difficulty communicating the difficult concepts to my undergraduate brain. Also, there is only 1 TA for some reason and he holds 1 hr of office hours per week. This is a very small window to get your questions answered so good luck on that field. Again, things are matlab based so that's good. My suggestion to you is divide and conquer the homework. There are one or two questions all with a couple of tasks. Divide the workload and work together. 
Remember--most of the class is graduate students. The lectures will be tailored to them but Professor Sajda is definitely someone who remembers being an undergrad and how stressful it can be. I found him to be understanding and this eased the course stress (despite the confusing material)

As a senior, I have taken courses with a myriad of professors. Maeve Sterbenz is the best humanities professor I’ve had thus far. She is very flexible with her office hours and gives everyone an ample amount of extra credit opportunities. Her 2 quizzes and 5-page concert paper are simple and straight-forward. In addition, she gives out quiz review sheets and even goes over them during class. Prior to the summer of 2015, I was hesitant to take summer classes. I was under the false impression that condensed summer classes would be much more rigorous than Fall/Spring Semester classes. She makes the class fun and smooth. Professor Sterbenz is a virtuoso who teaches with efficiency and charisma that is unparalleled. By the end of the course, you leave with an ‘A’ along with a new found interest in analyzing everything you listen to with more precision. After taking Professor Sterbenz’s class, I would highly recommend taking it with her.

I agree with the previous statement below that she is kind of a dick. She would tell me that the test are going to get easier as we go on, but it never did. Her test are tricky and if you are not familiar with science terminology you will not be fine. Overall, she is a ok lecturer but not a teacher. The TAs were also horrible they don't even know this stuff. She is from a farm town background which explains this dick attitude, she does not care about students' grade, she told us that the grade will be rounded up at the end of the semester if you are close to the next letter grade, but she never did round up my grade as it was 1 percent away from the next letter grade. This class is a nightmare especially for an Intro class. DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE if you just want to get the science core curriculum done!

I would have enrolled in this course even if it weren’t highly recommended by past students because the subject sounded so interesting. In the end, I consider this course to be the most important art history class I have ever taken and am excited to use what I learned in my future studies.
Professor Catterson based this summer’s lectures on her recent research in Italy. Though limited to specific areas, rather than examples from all periods in art history as I had imagined, she presented cases from her research in such a manner that, in addition to being incredibly interesting, Professor Catterson’s examples from her research journey helped the class to learn about how to do research on our own.
It was so exciting to be able to actually work with pieces of art- we were able to really get to know our items (and touch them!), which made it feel like our studies were actually real and not just theoretical. Our research took us to museum archives and libraries and put us in contact with people in and out of the art industry from all over the world. The course is a practical exercise in art history and many of the students found out new information about our objects that hadn't been documented before
We took three trips out of the classroom- to The Frick, Bonhams, and The Morgan. Each visit was incredibly informative and gave us a new perspective on each of the institutions. The access and information gained from these trips is something that I never imagined I would ever be able to experience as a student.
Professor Catterson is one of, if not the, best instructors I have had at Columbia and it is lamentable that she does not teach more classes. She is a rare exception in that she really cares about her students- we were her focus for the duration of the course, rather than nuisances. I felt that she truly believed that we were all doing something worthwhile, not just pithy undergraduate work like some professors seem to see it as. 
Any e-mails were promptly responded to (and I’m sure there were a lot); she would give reasonable explanations for her delay if they weren’t. If there was something the students could not get access to, Professor Catterson would use her knowledge and connections to help us get what we needed- truly above and beyond.  She is honest, passionate, and inspiring- I truly can’t say enough about how fortunate I felt to have studied under her. Her outlook on art history in general and her dedication to her students is absolutely refreshing. 
I urge every art history student to try and take a class with Professor Catterson.
Workload:
The coursework is a lot, especially because it has to be finished in a short summer session. Research will take up a lot of time outside of the classroom. However, Professor Catterson’s enthusiasm transferred to her students and made the assignment exciting for each student. I believe each student in my class was greatly involved in their research and ended up becoming downright passionate about their project (even though we were frequently frustrated and exhausted at the end. It was all worth it). Like I said, be prepared to put in a lot of hours outside of the classroom, but you will want to. Aside from a final paper that will be quite long (20-50 pages) that practically writes itself in the end, we had to do two presentations on our research for a midterm and a final. There are listed readings that aren’t discussed in class and you do not have to do them. However, I found myself taking time off from my research project to read some of the articles because I had become so interested in the topics in class.

NEVER EVER EVER TAKE A CLASS WITH RUBENSTEIN. If you do anything right in your 4 years at Columbia it will be to not take a class with him. This was the worst and most frustrating class I have ever taken at Columbia. At first he seems all buddy buddy with the class, but don't let this fool you. He is an awful lecturer and an extremely lazy teacher. It takes forever for the TAs to return hws. His assignments and tests are impossible to comprehend, filled with typos and convoluted sentences. The TA's rarely understood the hws themselves. Most of them took the class with Martha Kim and did not understand why Rubenstein would teach the material the way he did. They had to spend half the time you met with them just figuring out what he was asking. The averages in this class were extremely low. Yes, averages are often low in comp sci courses, but in this class it wasn't simply because of the difficulty. It was because no one understood the material because he can't teach!!!! After the midterm grades came back he came in front of the class and said that we shouldn't complain about the average being so low because we're columbia students and tests are supposed to be hard at Columbia. He constantly tells you not to worry about grades because they don't matter, which is just annoying. I learned more from a 10 minute youtube video than from 75 minutes in his class. I would go into more detail about the class, but he's not worth my time. I wasn't smart enough to listen to the reviews. Save yourself.

Dr. Bega is absolutely amazing. She is such a sweetheart, and is always extremely excited about the material (as mentioned by other reviews, especially in regards to the astrophysics section - her specialty). Though the nature of a 2-hour FroSci discussion leaves you dreading going to class, Dr. Bega tries her best to engage everyone in the material. She's possibly one of the happiest people I have ever met, and also one of the kindest, and most intelligent. When you ask her questions, she really knows what she's talking about, all the while understanding that most kids don't really enjoy the lecture. 
She also basically gives you all of the information you would ever need to know for any FroSci exam, and she is suuuuuper lenient on assignments. 
The only pain was that instead of the homework being due on Fridays (like everyone else's), it was due on Thursday. Eventually that got to be nice because then while everyone was struggling to finish their FroSci homework before they went out (or while they were already half-drunk), mine was already done and out of my hair.

Maybe it's because I'm a little older than most premeds here but the whole idea of forcing people to take your class because you think no one else teaches biology the right way is kind of ridiculous.

I honestly don't understand why Professor Carroll's other reviews are so negative. I'm not much of a language person and was only talking this course to fulfill the requirement, but I learned significantly more than I expected to. She was very kind and clearly cared a lot about our experience in the class. She asked us about our lives and did her best to make the new vocabulary interesting. There is some truth to the complaints mentioned in the other reviews. We often had to repeat ourselves in order to make sure she understood us clearly, but usually this was not a problem if we spoke up and articulated clearly. She was also consistently late by about 5 minutes, which while irksome wasn't really that big of a deal. She did have an impatient streak but her frustrations didn't end up translating into her opinions of us. While she did sometimes cut us short, she was also willing to go above and beyond to help us out. When I had questions about future french classes, she researched them on her computer right then and there. She would stay late to help us correct our compositions and was willing to scale back on assignments when we felt they weren't manageable. My experience in this class wasn't perfect but I would recommend Professor Carroll and I don't think students should be deterred based on the other culpa reviews.

This guy is so likable! Music Hum was pretty challenging for me as I had trouble recognizing things by ear. However, Mahir is so fun and clearly enjoys his job which always makes a class more enjoyable. He doesn't allow computers in class which is totally fine for what we're doing. The material was never dry and many of our assignments were fun and interesting (like seeing live symphonies and writing about them). We were assigned a fair amount of work but not everything was graded and handed back, likely counted more towards participation. 
When I was struggling with some assignments and clarity of terms I reached out to Mahir and he was incredibly helpful. He really does want everyone to do well and he spent a lot of time going over my study guides. I sent about three to him and he would correct where I was mistaken, tell me if I was missing anything and re-explain concepts in a new way. 
For the midterm and final he gave VERY clear expectations and provided a list (not too long) of songs/symphonies/operas/etc for us to study and then choose about 75% from that list. It made the whole thing so much less stressful.

A really fun course in microbio techniques. Prof. Dietrich really loves the material and shows it, both in how he lectures and how he helps you troubleshoot your results. You do two experiments, each taking about six weeks. In the first, you isolate and identify bacteria that you find in New York City. In the second, you do a transposon screen on P. aeruginosa to find phenazine regulatory genes. The TA's I had were really nice and would often meet with students outside of class to help them figure out what data meant. Professor Dietrich himself would work each student every class period, and really give me the guidance I needed to figure out what was going on.

Professor Parsons is a refreshingly straightforward and engaging professor.  His lectures are clearly given, and his expectations are both reasonable and comprehensible.  Exam averages tend to be relatively high -- a testament to his clear expectations and goals -- meaning that this is not a class for those obsessed with curves.  If you work hard, pay attention, attend EVERY lecture (he does not always follow the textbook, often has his own style for solving problems, and does not post lecture notes), and seek out help when you need it, you will do well in the class.
This is not a class for those who want to dive deep into Physics (i.e. get a conceptual understanding of concepts).  Parsons tends to present a topic, tell you how to solve a specific type of problem on that topic, and expect you to essentially memorize the procedure and apply it to a general, but predictable, format of problems.  Essentially, I know 'Parsons Physics' but I cannot necessarily apply that knowledge to novel problems.  With that said, Physics serves a pretty utilitarian function for Pre-Meds, and Parsons gets this.
Finally, I should add that he is a really cool guy, and at the top of his field.  If anything, the class is worth it because of the opportunity you have to be in the presence of one of the greats.  His office hours are, again, utilitarian, but he is a really interesting Physicist and it is a real treat when he shares some of his current work with the class at the end of the semester.

I took Prof. Savizky for Gen. Chem II in the Spring semester.  The key to success in Savizky's class is knowing how to play the game.  I attended all lectures (after reading the chapter) but this is not strictly necessary -- he tends to just read the slides.  Importantly, and this cannot be stressed enough, he DOES NOT use Zuhmdahl even though he does not say this explicitly.  The recommended textbooks are the basis of the class, including where test questions are taken from.  Reading these books and completing their practice problems (esp. Atkins and Hill) is the key to success.  My exam grades improved 20% once I started preparing this way (I just wish I had learned sooner than after the first two midterms).
To his credit, Savizky is very responsive to email, and quite genuine in his interactions with students.  While office hours can be packed, he will meet privately and does take care to build relationships with those who demonstrate commitment.  The class may be boring and feel like a game, but he really is a nice guy.

I came into my UW class with extremely low expectations (I mean, who ever raves about a mandatory writing class), but Ms Zander's class blew me away.
Ms. Zander was kind, fair, and smart - but above all, she was just a really good teacher with the rare ability to facilitate classes effectively. She frequently made time for ""focused free writes"" during classes (which helpfully trained us to be more reflective throughout the writing process), created a very inclusive and non-threatening class environment, and taught us the finer points of academic writing super effectively. And while her essay feedback was top-notch + incredibly helpful, she wasn't the sort to force her opinion down students' throats. Like if you choose not to incorporate her (usually on-point) suggestions into your next draft, it's okay, no one will die. Also, she fed us with cookies/donuts. So I can say with some certainty that Ms. Zander was an excellent instructor to have - and you're lucky if you get her! She's a grad student, though, so I don't know how long she'll be around for. 
Maybe the only con of this class for me would have been the readings. I didn't particularly enjoy most of them (I chose unthemed precisely because I didn't want to have to deal with gender twice a week; however, many of the readings ended up being related to gender issues anyway). But those were just my personal preferences I guess. And anyway the quality of teaching more than made up for the readings by far.

Professor Graham is a great teacher because of his class's structure. In class, there was an open and constant dialogue. There were very few instances where there was ""dead air."" I think his idea to use different hand signals to indicate whether the next student wanted to introduce a new idea or continue on the idea being discussed was a great help to how well the class was run.
Outside of class, I found Professor Graham extremely approachable. The two office hours I went to were extremely helpful in reshaping my understanding of the texts we were reading. In the office hours, Professor Graham listened to my interpretation of the text and then offered criticism on it. I thought his criticism was extremely helpful and admirable because he could have just as well said this is the way to approach the text and there is no other way to do so. In the office hours I also found Professor Graham very kind and respectful towards his students. He expresses a genuine interest in what every one of his students is doing outside of class. I would highly recommend Professor Graham for a class in LitHum.

Professors Sacks is the man. He deserves a gold nugget. His class is everything I hoped for in a Columbia core class. He really knows his stuff, but he never dominates the discussion. He uses his knowledge of the material to enhance the discussions, but he encourages you to draw your own conclusion. He values your opinion. He's so so smart, but not pretentious at all. He will ask the most deep-cutting questions but still keeps a great sense of humor throughout the class. I wish all my professors were like him. He's such a cool dude. 
As far as grading goes, he doesn't assign much work, but he expects your papers to be thoughtful and well written. Honestly, if you're a good writer and insightful reader, he'll give you an A. If not, well then you're shit out of luck.

Definitely one of the best classes I've taken here at Columbia. Hansen's an excellent lecturer, extremely clear, and best of all he can actually speak English which already makes him more competent than half of the math department. He's super chill, always ready and able to answer any questions that you might have. The class isn't a walk in the park but is easy by math major coursework standards. Only con to taking this class is there isn't much cryptography covered, but I guess there's Making, Breaking Codes if you're more interested in that.

This is the best class I have ever taken during my undergraduate time and I'm about to begin my final semester. Nam (what he prefers to be called) is absolutely amazing! He is a PhD student himself but puts so much effort into teaching and making sure he is available for questions outside of class. A 3 hour class might sound long but it goes by so quickly because Nam is so enthusiastic about teaching and he makes sure to give a couple of breaks in between hours.
He holds 2 hours of office hours every week, usually on Monday nights (which is the day before class). GO TO THOSE! He will literally go through all the problems on the problem set, which is pretty difficult to do on your own, so you can easily get good grades on those. 
The class wasn't curved because the distribution was spread evenly and exam averages were about 70-80. Only the final was curved (20 points added to 220) because it was ridiculously hard and he realized that himself after. 
Biochemistry is a difficult class but if you put in the work, an A is within reach. Exams were hard but I got by with studying for them about 3-5 days ahead, tops, and I ended up with an A- in the class.

Ms. Tsygankova seems to be a very nice person, and in class, she basically tells everyone that they have a good point when they contribute ideas during discussion. Now this is definitely very encouraging (better than teachers who shut your ideas down), but her persona seems to be totally different when she's writing to you - whether it's through email, feedback, or even in the syllabus. She's a friendly person and easy to talk to, but just a lot harsher in her written comments, so be prepared for that. 
This isn't to say that she's an unfair grader - I think she's definitely strict with her grading, and she expects you to get through some very dense readings, but I don't think her reasoning for her grades are necessarily unjustified. However, I did find it difficult sometimes to understand what exactly she wanted from me, or what she wanted me to do to fix my writing. She would point out that I was doing something wrong, but I often found myself wishing she could give me more advice on how to fix it.
Some papers that she made us read had interesting topics, but the papers we had to write for U-Writing were a pain-in-the-butt (not really her fault though). Ms. Tsygankova's not a bad teacher to have - she's not life-changing or anything, but you won't die if you have her.

Professor Briggs' W3350 class was not easy for me. I struggled with Spanish in nearly all areas - writing, reading, speaking, listening, cultural understanding, etc., but go to his office hours, and he'll be pretty helpful in regards to how you should fix up your essays (which are probably the most important part of the class grade). He's a good guy, but he's not wary of asking questions that are difficult to answer immediately, and he's not afraid to tell you straight-up that you're not thinking far enough for your essays. Be prepared to work hard, and you should be fine.

We went backwards through history, reading texts that were more modern first and going back to the 1700s at the end of the semester. The readings were usually about ten pages or so, but very dense and difficult to get through. We would also have to form questions regarding the text, and then research more information to answer our own questions (research would have to be cited from reliable sources). You'd write this research into a short paragraph and upload it online. Most classes, we would start off by naming themes in the reading, then it would be someone's turn to present on the author of the day, then we would go back to the themes, break up into groups and read the uploaded homeworks to see what new information we could draw out about the themes.

I've never reviewed a class, but after reading the comment bellow on Katie's Dance in New York class I felt like I had to respond. The reviewer clearly had some sort of dispute, because Katie's Dance in New York class was fantastic! She clearly cared about every performance we attended, and her love of every aspect of the theater showed. I will say that the quality of the class was dependent on the quality of discussions, which varied. I can also see where the reviewer might have found the grading arbitrary. The assignments tended to be more creative than analytical. However, you get all sorts of choice and opportunity to better your grade. For each performance, you can choose between four questions, and you only have to respond to four of 12 performances over the course of the semester. She'll also take your four highest grades if you respond to more. You can also turn in papers with corrections a week after you get them back. She really wants you to do well!

This class was not good, and Professor Gamber does not (in any way) deserve a gold nugget. I don't know how many negative reviews he needs before CULPA changes that.
Like many reviewers have already said, while the books and lectures were enjoyable, the lectures were only superficial and very rarely succeeded to expand my understanding of the text or of the issues at large. Truly all he did was dramatically read long quotes from the texts without any substantial analysis. He runs through many different literary elements that were present in the text without every really connecting them to issues of immigration/relocation or explaining them thoroughly. I have come out of this class not really knowing anything more about literature about movement than I did at the beginning. 
The assessments and grading were horrific. I understand that he had a problem at the beginning with his TA's, but that's really no excuse. It's absurd that the midterm essays were graded out of 5, with two of those points awarded for identifying the author and title. There absolutely should have been more than one paper, worth 40% of the final grade, so we could have improved our writing and more fully understood what the professor and TA's were looking for. The grading was very harsh, almost to an arbitrary extent. The final was god-awful, as others have already explained, despite the fact that I really did read all of the books. All of this is to say that the exams and papers in absolutely no way assessed what we learned in the course. 
Prof. Gamber may be a nice person, but he does not seem to be a particularly good professor, and I implore you to reconsider before taking this class.

I am not an EALAC or History major, but this was one of my fondest courses from undergrad. Prof. Pflugfelder is exactly what you would hope a professor to be at this University - a true subject matter expert, who is very approachable, fair, and engaging.
A previous reviewer mentioned that this, ""is not a military history course by any means, but there's a bit of that."" In actuality, the fundamental essence of the samurai was his capacity as a warrior. Hence, everything involving the samurai was in some way military, but the class explores, ""every conceivable angle--sexuality, ethics, legend, economics, law, gender roles, art, literature, film, political formations, major figures,"" as he or she noted.
If you have any interest at all in Japanese History, the chance to explore it via ""Who is the Samurai?"" is a fantastic opportunity.

Gamber is glib, sarcastic, witty, funny, and well-rehearsed. He showed up to every class in a suite and tie, and his presentations were always perfectly prepared and executed.
Despite that, things went wrong from day one: there weren't enough TAs for the course, so he had to cancel the mandatory discussion sections. This also meant he had to cancel one of the papers for the class. The books were all interesting, but Gamber really gives off the impression that he cares more about his research than his students. He flat out doesn't seem to care about reading the midterms. The midterm was writing three short essays on excerpts that were easy to identify if you came to lectures -- you didn't even need to read the books -- and was essentially graded on whether or not you 1) knew the title and author of the quote, and 2) could write more than one paragraph on it. Most of the students in the class seemed to get a perfect or near-perfect score.
The paper, though, was graded incredibly harshly, and the final was impossible. Like the midterm, the final was quotes that were far more obscure, and even people who read all of the books (I read most of them, but not all of them) had trouble identifying them.
Oh, and he also claimed that he automatically failed 15% of the class for not handing the paper in on time, no exceptions. So there's that as well. He doesn't really have time for bullshit, but he also doesn't seem to care how much we're absorbing other than if we have read the books. The problem is this: all he cared about was reading the books, but the class soon became so much more than the books. They were jumping off points for a larger discussion on race and movement in America post-1965, which is amazing and interesting, but so much of his lectures had nothing to do with what we were being graded on.
Just read the books yourself. Most of them are pretty short, and they're by and large really good.

Professor Lozano is extremely sweet and friendly. The class definitely helped me learn a lot of new things about immigration, even if the readings we did were terribly boring (she did talk about changing the reading material for the next semester, so it might be different now, but the textbook that we used was extremely dry), and I'm pretty sure many people didn't do the readings anyway. I wouldn't suggest not reading, because I think she noticed people slacking off at the end of the semester, and she would ask more specific questions, but she never really grilled anyone, if that's what you're worried about. 
Participation definitely helps, and she's very open to new/different opinions. Immigration is a very sensitive topic, but she's always asking for someone to offer a perspective that might be different from her own. Our particular class never really had super-vibrant discussions, and we all played it pretty safe with what we said. It's not a tough class if you do the basics.

I took this class as an econ major with an OK but not great background in math. I'd recommend it if you have to take it (especially since all my friends died in ""real"" analysis) but be aware:
PROS:
(1) Professor Maulik is decent. I was afraid we were going to get an Indian dude with a heavy accent but he grew up here and speaks American English. He's helpful and responds quickly to emails and is often willing to give extensions on the homework
(2) The curve is pretty generous; something in the 80s range will get you an A
(3) Zhenrui was an awesome TA! He held review sessions before every midterm and final which were super helpful as far as getting a feel for the material goes. Sometimes it looks like he's sleeping in the back and then he'll raise his hand and point out an error on the board or ask exactly the right question to clarify a point when a lot of people look confused. I didn't really interact with the other TAs that much but my friends that did said they were pretty OK too.
CONS:
(1) There is a steep learning curve if you've never done proofs before (I hadn't). A large part of lectures as well as the homeworks and the exams will require you to do proofs and not baby ""derivation"" proofs where you just work backwards and manipulate down some equations until they look like what you want like in Calc III. Points are taken off for unjustified steps or logical errors. Memorizing definitions is a MUST
(2) The class is pretty dull; even though it's pitched as a math class for econ/econometrics/finance it's pretty obvious that Prof Maulik is a pure mathematician and doesn't really do applications. He tries to bring them in sometimes but it's usually not the same as when you actually have to use them in an econ setting
(3) Half the time everyone was asleep since we were just going over stuff from Calc III or linal and the other half of the time everyone was totally lost (which might have been why the curve was so generous)
(4) Class interaction probably *negatively* impacts this class. I have no illusions about my mathematical abilities but it seemed like only really dumb questions got asked in class, and then Prof M would waste time rehashing very basic concepts like the dot product because he thinks we don't understand it. Fortunately in a lecture of ~100 it's not very interactive.

Prof Wang isn't the most animated lecturer and the room gets hot and it's Friday and it's easy to start dozing off. None of that changes the fact that information theory is BEAUTIFUL. It's easy to get lost in the mathematics (of which there is a lot - more on that in a bit). I highly recommend taking some time after you get home and try to digest what you're learning, get an intuitive feel for what entropy and channel capacity and ""information"" are, and you will find your mind blown time and time again. The idea that something as ""dumb"" and taken for granted as zipping a file is (asymptotically) equivalent to something as profound as automatically finding all the structure in a dataset is at first unfathomable but becomes obvious as you go along and has very exciting implications.

Unfortunately some of the proofs are quite tedious.

Professor Bininachvili is an interesting man, to say the least. His lectures are fascinating, and he is very knowledgeable. The course was long, but time passed quickly because of the interesting nature of the class.
As others said, the work load is rather minimal --one paper and one oral EXAM, not just an interview (see later).
Despite the greatness of the class and the prof himself, there are a few negative points. Prof B is cool when you chat with him outside of class on certain days, and on other days he is so rude and condescending that you feel like never talking to him again. It feels like he just looks at you and answers to you in a way because he really does not care about you have to say. I guess its just his character because there are other times where he is very nice and helpful... Just when you talk to him, I hope its on a good day because he can be very mean. He seems to have favorites
The final paper and exam: There is one paper (10-12 pages) on pretty much any topic ( he must approve it). I do not think he has very high expectations for the papers and grades them almost overnight. The readings he assigns MUST be done, if not during the final oral exam you will be in trouble. The final exam was quite stressful and scary, as I said he is an imposing man who can be harsh at times. You have to know every important detail of the course and be ready to speak about it with him in the exam. You have to know the topics and be able to define them with ease --if not he will just send you off with a look of disappointment and give you a lower grade (regardless of the work you put into the paper). Then again he is a lenient and nice grader and understands that we are not experts in the field.
Overall, I would suggest you take the course, its very interesting and Columbia offers nothing else like it. He is very knowledgeable and interesting, and you will learn a great deal --just be hard working and respectful and you will be graded accordingly. Regardless of the negative comments, he's really awesome and should get more involved in teaching at Columbia.

This class, with this professor, was incredible. I am not an art major, but I love art, and he challenged me more than I have every been challenged before in this subject. I wanted to take a class that pushed the boundaries of my artistic capability, and this one did. The class is long, and you will probably need to put in extra hours, just considering you are trying to make a replica of a cast (but on paper). When you are done, though, the product makes it so worth it.
Professor Minoff knows what he is doing. He does this kind of work for a living, amongst other drawing and painting techniques , so he is experienced. He periodically roams the room and gives very honest, constructive feedback. With this kind of intricate drawing, his trained eye was invaluable during the drawing process. He is super friendly and sweet to everyone, and will give credit where credit is due.
If you put in enough effort, and really try hard to perfect your drawing, an A is attainable (though not necessarily easy). He defines an A student as one who consistently goes above and beyond the drawing expectations, and he is consistent with that in class.
I HIGHLY recommend taking this class, but it definitely takes a lot of work. Also, if you don't want him drawing on your paper, just let him know you'd prefer he teach on a separate sheet and he has no problem with that.

It might be hard at first, but if you sincerely work at it, it will benefit you in all of your classes. The problem sets are everything. Do not wait until the last minute before an exam to work on them. Do a couple of problems every night and -  this part is crucial - review your mistakes on the problem sets! Make sure you understand where you made mistakes in your thought process.

Ann Douglas is a powerhouse. Brilliant, quirky, and endlessly passionate about film noir, this class often felt like her attempt to somehow cram her lifetime love for the genre into concise two-hour sessions, complete with her original analysis as well as innumerable tangents about, say, the 5th camera crew's freedom in Fritz Lang's this-and-that. 
She begins the course by treating noir as a sort of historical entry in the arc of post-colonial scholarship, and this subversive bent shapes the rest of the class. It turns out film noirs are among the most powerful social critiques of American society in their time. Douglas is a radical in the truest sense of the word - she was one of the first women to bust into the academy and it's easy to see why. She is whip-smart, creative, and truly loves the material she is teaching. Getting the chance to tap into that energy in a tiny overpacked room in Philosophy (probably chosen because it has the only VHS player left at Columbia) each week was an honor, a pleasure, and a privilege.
The class itself is run somewhat haphazardly - Douglas brightly solicits student feedback, but also cut students off mid-comment over half the time. This was kind of annoying, but also forgivable because it was always out of her exuberance about the topic. We never covered all the stuff she seemed to want to, perhaps because she ran class by occasionally looking down at a scrawled sheet of paper with all the amazing things she loved about the movie that week. Unstructured, yes, but it hardly mattered. This course is less about coming away with factoids about film noir and more about capturing the sense of it all - what one of her favorite readings calls the ""specific sense of malaise"" that pervades noirs. Combined with the post-colonial critique framing the movies, all the juiciness of noir gets drawn out so you can wrestle with its dark implications for the United States and modern society. 
She also loves when students come to her office hours, and will happily chat your head off about something you mention as well as help you with your paper if you want. 
Film Noir is a journey of learning in the truest sense. What a delight.

Just noticed that there's no review for Shamus's methods class, so thought I'd throw one in there. I took Social World with Shamus and thought it was just okay, but his Methods class (taken Spring 2015) was really superb. 
Shamus does what more teachers should but do not do - assign clear projects with deadlines and then present all the information needed to succeed. If you need help, you can seek it out. If you blow it, he does not care, but you know you had everything you need to succeed and then some. This is a refreshing and quite frankly generous mentality. 
And he really loves Methods. This class did a phenomenal job of presenting lots of different methods as unique ways of understanding problems that are better or worse in certain contexts (ex. ethnography provides detailed insight that survey data does not; experimental methods are the best way to test causality but often cost too much/are not feasible). He has you try each method and reflect on it in a ""lab report."" I also appreciated how rigorous his approach to science is - he wasn't trying to make us into the budding genius researchers that lots of people thought they were, but rather meticulous investigators who hesitated to jump to any conclusions. It made me a more skeptical and rigorous thinker and I appreciated it. 
This is a class taken mostly by sociology majors, and you probably don't want to take it if you're not one. That said, if you have to take Methods, take it from Khan. This was the only college class I regret not doing more work for, and I still learned a lot. Thanks, Shamus!

I came into this class with a moderate interest and no idea of what to expect. I left it overawed, and no one but Marcus Folch could have made that happen.
He intended for the class to consist of 20-30 students so it could be somewhat discussion-based, but someone forgot to set the limit on SSOL. There were almost a hundred for whole course. I don't know how he and the TAs felt about that, but they took it in stride. They got more TAs (obviously) and somehow kept on top of all of the papers and tests in a timely fashion.
Folch was a patient, clearly spoken, insightful, and unbelievably witty. Somehow he was able to give his lectures some elements of discussion in spite of the class' size. We also held informal and guided discussion sessions outside of class. In all cases, I would leave those things feeling like I had gotten my money's worth. What higher praise can you offer than that when you go here? 
He assigned mini essay questions for each week, of which you had to do at least 3. 
The reading varied week to week between moderate (excerpts from Plato's work and some academic essays) to extensive (all of the Analects of Confucius). It's surprisingly doable, but you have to plan ahead so that you can take advantage of the lighter weeks. 
There was one big paper due by the end of the semester, and that was challenging (but fun!) because we could customize our topic with TAs. 
The midterm and the final: essays and terms (both fine), but super-extensive passage identification. You get all possible material on review sheets. If you haven't thought up and written out your answers in review then you are not 
going to like these tests. 
In summary: Tough. Worth it. Easily my favourite experience at Columbia. I look forward to his next class.

I took this class last fall and really enjoyed it overall. Carrie is a nice lady and is really passionate about teaching. Not much work for the class. There's a weekly visual analysis which is quite simple and is graded extremely leniently. One midterm, one paper, and one final project. I think she was a bit harder on the grading of the paper, so just a head's up. 
Carrie really takes the time to explain things and even added extra sections about Japanese art which I found really interesting. As long as you participate in class and put effort into your work you should be fine! Just take the paper and final projects seriously. Would recommend this class!

Victor Corona is one of the most fascinating professors I've ever had. He is a great lecturer and his syllabus is fantastic. The readings are interesting and well chosen. But (and this is a big but) he is the most arrogant, self-centered, and inappropriate professor on campus. His lectures always end up wandering onto the topic of him, what he's writing, the famous people he knows, and the hot LES clubs he visits. Before we started writing midterms we spent one day of class going around proposing topic ideas. Some he loved, some he was neutral on, and some he hated. Instead of giving constructive criticism he tore my classmates apart. He even went so far as to say that the next person that presents their topic idea should have something good or else he would ""throw himself out the window and into Broadway."" While this was mildly entertaining, it is completely inappropriate for a professor to behave in this manner. He also has a bad habit of picking favorites (if you're an attractive girl who likes to go clubbing he will love you). One class he had the audacity to wear reflective sunglasses while lecturing which left me speechless. Additionally he frequently calls certain kinds of people douche bags. I get it. Some of the people we discuss in class easily fall into that category, but he did it so frequently that it lost its entertainment value and just came off as unprofessional and lacking the ability to articulate his sentiments. 
If you take his class you need to do the readings (which isn't hard because they are all interesting) and arrive prepared to be called on even if you don't raise your hand. Make sure you have a thick skin because he will put you on blast if he doesn't like what you have to say. Occasionally he conceded that a students argument was sound despite his disagreement (but that was as rare as the Hamilton elevator being free).
If I could go back in time I would get a list of the readings he selected and then drop the class. He has the potential to be a great professor, but he needs to lose the attitude and remember that we are students paying and showing up to be taught by a professional. Not a whining diva who wants to go get his drink on at The Box.

Professor Ellsberg was one of the most humane, full of life, kind, creative, and interesting teachers I happened to meet in my time at Columbia. As an international student, I came having very little knowledge of English poetry and literature. Professor Ellsberg opened my eyes to this world, and turned her class into my favorite part of the week. 
I also loved Professor Ellsberg's choice of readings, like Jane Eyre for example. However, she was so easy going and wanting her students to enjoy the class that she would jokingly tell us we could watch the movies for assigned readings if we ran out of time. Essentially, we never got tested on the content of the readings so they were really only used to enrich our knowledge and love of literature. 
To say her tests were fair game is an understatement. Professor Ellsberg's tests consisted of quotes/passages she took directly out of poems we read in class. EVERY single quote was taken out of a poem she told us explicitly would be on the exam. Therefore, if you became familiar with the poems she mentioned would be on an exam you could easily ace it.

Professor Bloom is a great teacher. I had him for Intermediate I and then Compo&Convo. I'll review Compo&Convo since other people have covered Intermediate I.
It's a very nice class. You have three 'units'. The first was reading a novel (Bonjour Tristesse) and then discussing it in class. It's sort of like a warm up unit. You talk all the time during class, and have discussions. It's very nice and comforting, and he is a very 'chill' professor, very sweet, very nice and doesn't intimidate you. It is a relaxing atmosphere to just talk. He assigns people to prepare stuff for each class, so like one person will sign up as the ""presenter"" and will talk about what they noticed and start the discussion. He uses the courseworks discussion board so that the people can post their observations & question about that day's reading. He prints out the discussion board the day of class, and he has the presenter talk and then read through the discussions. People will talk about what they wrote, or comment on other people's work. Then you have someone that does the vocab, and finds about 7 words that they didn't know/feel is important to know for the reading, and you send that list to him. He also prints the list out. 
The second unit is on current events, like France's problem with xenophobia, issues in ""la banlieue"", French schooling, the French version of ""satire"" and what is satire or what is not satire and crosses that line of offensive, things like that. The third unit was reading French thinkers, and their work that discusses New York. So like, Sartre, Baudrillard, Simon de Beauvoir, etc. 
There are two or three vocab quizzes, based on the vocab lists made by your peers. Very straight forward, and they have wordbanks and you fill in the correct form in the sentences provided. There are also 3 in class essays, that he provides the prompts for like a week in advance, and then you have a week to rewrite the essay for a higher grade after he hands back the corrections. Then there's two or three take-home essays, where you don't rewrite those and you hand them in. Every week there's a journal that you write of about less than 500 words about whatever you want. Literally. Just as long as you write something, it's good. He grades these with check marks. The more interesting the topic and the better your use of French, the higher the number of checks. I remember getting four checks once, on a journal I wrote about the relationship between étrange and étranger. I also once wrote an essay about my cats and got like three checks on that as well, so your topics can be silly or serious, as long as you edit them for misspellings and grammer and things of that nature. During the second unit when we discussed satire, he assigned a newspaper/journal/television program (1 'program' per 2 people, but you could both decide if you wanted to work alone or together. Alone you had a shorter presentation, together it would be slightly longer.). You would research the program and then give a little mini presentation.  
A lot of your grade is dependent upon your participation but don't worry! He uses your journals, the discussion posts and in class talking to determine that grade. The presentations also go toward participation grade.
Overall, a fun class. It's very relaxed, and Professor Bloom is not trying to fail you. He is a nice grader, and he takes the revised grade of your essay instead of the original or a combination of the two, so you get a higher grade. Also the vocab quizzes are easy to do well on. Very hard not to get an A, or even an A+ in this class.

Dr. Pizzigoni is an extremely knowledgable professor and it's obvious that she truly loves her job. Dr. Pizzigoni is one of the few professors at Columbia -- at least in my opinion -- that is prepared every single class. She clearly has a direction that she wants to take the class in and points to make along the way. As a graduate student, I was unsure if I wanted to analyze 'colonial' documents. Walking away from Pizzigoni's class, I have decided to write a thesis using exclusively colonial documents. I do caution graduate students to err on the side of caution with Dr. Pizzigoni when deciding deadlines for final papers as she is not very flexible, despite understanding that graduate students are writing papers in every course (which was really disappointing). Regardless, I highly recommend Dr. Pizzigoni as she really opened doors and changed the way I approach all forms of written history.

First week of class under the belt and Prof Owen is great! I was worried about registering for his course because there are no reviews to be found as this is his first time teaching the subject at Columbia. I was pleasantly surprised as he has a fair grading policy (refer to workload), his lectures are organized and to the point, and he really hones in on real world applications so everything begins to make sense. Lectures...he leads the lecture by powerpoint, which is helpful because slides are posted following lecture for review (he says he will try to post them prior to lecture in the future, but either way works for now). He moves at a comprehensible pace, will take student questions, and gives lots of examples. He definitely wants you to know the concepts, but the examples really drive the information home. He has an upbeat, approachable demeanor and his subtle sense of humor makes an appearance now and then. He also focuses on the information that we will be tested on. He made a point early on that he would rather us know what to study and have the exams be a little more difficult on the subject matter, rather than study and memorize entire chapters because we have no idea what will show up.
Prof Owen uses an online discussion board. He would like you to utilize this as class participation, which is a great alternative to cold-calling and answering questions during lecture. I have found the discussion board to be very helpful because anyone can start a thread on any topic. We can see what our peers are having issues with, and we see a very comprehensive answer. Also, the answers are posted quickly because 150+ people are able to respond. The discussion board is not graded, rather taken into account if in between grades. That's all for now!

I'll make this concise. Knuckolls is thee best Organic Chem professor in this building. I wish that he taught Orgo I because Cornish and Doubleday's methods were way too convoluted. He said on day one that his exams were a direct reflection of his lectures and that was the truth. I appreciated his honesty, there were no surprises.

So, like stated in the other reviews, Heather is NOT an ideal person to be leading a CC course. The Core is here for us to engage our ideas with those of one another and explore various concepts through the texts. Now, in Heather's class, that is not the case at all. She pushes discussions so they follow what SHE believes about the text and what SHE wants to discuss. She could give less of a sh*t about what we as students want to talk about. Her grading is beyond unfair -- she's so ridiculously anal and nitpicks the smallest details. When going into office hours, any questions she is presented with get thrown back with either super vague answers or no answer at all. 
Also, for those dealing with any psychological struggles, transfer out of her class ASAP. I have several clinically-diagnosed psychological issues, one of which is severe social anxiety. I reached out to her so I would not have my participation grade affected as much by this, and it turned out to be a ridiculous mistake on my part. She brushed it off, saying ""social anxiety isn't real"" and that my being nervous was ""all in my head."" Never had I felt more dismissed. She then proceeded to tell me that had I told her this in the beginning of the semester (which I did -- I came to her in the second week of class), she would have encouraged me to switch out. God knows why I didn't just run then.
So all in all, if you're looking for the worst possible CC experience AND have your psychological issues both exacerbated and dismissed, you can get it with Heather.

Ilia is a decent professor. He's extremely clear about what he means and often repeats himself to make his point even clearer. That being said, the class could be rather dull, and it wasn't always easy to motivate yourself to go.
His exams (2 midterms and a final) were very similar to the practice tests. The problem sets were straight out of the textbook. If you did the problem sets yourself, and the practice tests, there's really nothing else you needed to do for the exams.
He also has a pretty fair policy of allowing up to 2 late days for 2 homeworks and you get to drop one homework (There's only like 6 or 7), so it's not too bad. That said, Ilia is supposed to be a tougher Discrete Mathematics professor than some of the others out there, although I didn't think he was too bad.

I had Chris for UWriting, and he was an amazing professor. Extremely nice, very helpful (both in and out of class) and a very fair grader. He also brought food to the class sometimes, which was always welcome.
Chris taught really well, graded fairly and gave very helpful comments. He also had one-on-one meetings with students to speak to us about our drafts and see if we were going in the right direction. Not a super hard class if you do what Chris says (He's very fair about work and extensions). He also gave a lot of very practical advice, like how to get past writer's block, email etiquette, how to make your argument sound stronger, etc.
Chris also gives 2 free extension 'coupons' at the beginning of the semester which you can use if you want more time for a paper. Other than that, he also gave other extension opportunities (like 'attending this event and you get an extra extension coupon', etc).
TLDR: If you get Chris for UW, consider yourself blessed.

Enthusiastic professor that really made me appreciate Greek/Roman history more. Unlike what the other person said I don't think he's pompous about having gone to Cornell at all, when he talks about it he seems more self-deprecating or ironic in a way. Although he does take a while to get papers back he is very accessible via email and after class usually. A lot of the class is reading old white men books, but it was an overall nice experience to take the class.

I was very surprised when reading Prof. Roberts' other reviews because I thought that his seminar was GREAT. Perhaps he is more effective in seminars than he is in lectures (but I have also seen Prof. Roberts speak for large groups of people, and I think that he can be an organized, effective speaker). First of all, as mentioned in other reviews, Prof. Roberts is brilliant. He has a deep understanding of the history of racial inequality and criminal justice in the United States and always brought his expertise in the history of medical and public health into our discussions. All of the texts that we read for the course were extremely interesting and gave us a good historical foundation for our discussions on current events related to policing and incarceration.
Although Prof. Roberts' classes were sometimes not as organized as they could have been, I did not necessarily think that this was a complete loss. The way that he structured the class gave us the space to discuss the parts of the texts that were most relevant and interesting to us and to talk about how the historical framework that the texts provided shaped our understanding of these issues presently. Also, as a professor who is actively working to address the issues that he discusses in his work, Roberts brings his applied experiences and practical knowledge into the classroom.
Lastly, Prof. Roberts genuinely cares about his students' growth. He demonstrates this by leaving class time to address students' specific interests, meeting with students one-on-one regularly, and providing detailed feedback on assignments. For example, the big project of the course was to write a 20-page research paper related to the history of criminal justice in the United States (we pick the specific topic). From the first class, Prof. Roberts emphasized that we should meet with him to discuss the paper and so that he would be able to provide resources/show us where to find resources and so that he could get a better understanding of our research interests and career goals. Prof. Roberts' individualized guidance (that was always honest and never sugar-coated) made me a much stronger writer and researcher. It was an honor to learn from a professor who is genuinely dedicated to ensuring that his work in academia has a direct impact on the communities that he centers.
Workload:
Manageable. There is sometimes lot of reading, but you do not have to read all of it to engage in thoughtful discussion. The major assignment is a 20-page paper due at the end of the semester. Throughout the semester, there are smaller assignments due to ensure that you are working on your final paper throughout the semester (e.g. thesis statement, draft 1, draft 2). Final paper is a significant percentage of final grade, but you have the opportunity to submit a draft for which he will give a lot of detailed feedback.

Fantastic professor. He was extremely clear throughout every lecture, and took time after every lecture to answer every question you have, even if that means reviewing what he went over in class. If you're taking CS courses in the summer, definitely consider this one to knock out your requirements.
The problem sets didn't take too long, and as for the midterm and final, he gives out a study guide that will indicate pretty much what *exactly* will be on them. The workload is very, very light, and the exams are very fair if you use the study guides he provides. Honestly, you can spend very little time preparing outside of class for the exams if you pay attention in class and sometimes stay after class to ask questions because he's that clear (some will say slow-paced, but the concepts are very well-elucidated). He largely covers the textbook, but I never found myself really needing to turn to it.

He is a very engaging lecturer, but the way he teaches this class is terrible.
The lectures have very, very little to do with the chapters we are reading. If he does go over something it is fast and at the most cursory level. There is massive amounts of reading and he gives you review sheets that supposedly cover the breadth of the test. 
You honestly might not even do all the work because the majority of the test is on his philosophical musings on the nature of the universe. Taking notes in his class is a nightmare. For instance, he will mention fermions in passing once, with no emphasis. The textbook does not even reference them once. You will have a detailed question on the exam about fermions that has nothing to do with what he actually taught or what you might be able to read in the book. All of the vocabulary, all of the work of studying processes and the items he puts on the review sheets (ie. actual biology) are not really on the test. (Honestly maybe at best 20%).
If I had to do this over again, I would have dropped this class before the shopping period was up. I was thinking about going into Environmental Biology, but I don't want to take any more classes with this professor (who I believe also teaches the companion class.)
Unless you are 100% absolutely going into the major, don't consider it.
Workload:
Tons of reading, but no ""homework."" You are expected to come into the class with a real mastery of biology and chemistry despite what the course description says. If you do not come with this kind of pre-requisite knowledge (I was somewhere a little below mastery) and it will be a struggle.

I LOVE THIS PROFESSOR! I mean, not only is she one of the absolute nicest people ever, but she's also an incredible lecturer; she is so energetic and encouraging of all her students to speak up.You can really just tell she loves the subject. She also happens to be my advisor and she really just goes above and beyond, she always makes herself available if you need any help or to meet with her last minute. As for the class, it's just incredible. The way she teaches it gives you a whole new way of looking not just at African theory but also at political science theory in general, giving you the pros and limitations of every single argument or theory she presents (even the ones she favors). Even if you aren't super interested in sub-saharan African conflict and violence, take this class just to have her as a professor. And by the end of the second day, you probably will be interested anyway because it's a fascinating subject.

Decent amount of reading but absolutely nothing unmanageable. Really fair amount of work. One four page paper, a midterm 8 page paper, and an 8 page final paper.

I hope Paul teaches Music Hum for years and years to come, because I could not have asked for a better professor. Unlike many art/music professors, he approached the subject in a way equally accessible and engaging to students with a strong background in music (I suppose I was one) and those with little formal training in music. Totally unpretentious, informative, engaging, receptive to and encouraging of student opinions, and understanding. The course was taught in a relaxed manner that covered the major musical eras and composers, and offered lots of interesting history and musical comparisons. Rather than stressing students out with crazy music theory or listening tests, he emphasized appreciation and interpretation of music, and the more technical aspects of music and preparation for listening IDs came easily along with it. TLDR: really great professor, definitely take him for Music Hum.

This was the most rewarding class I have yet to take in CS. Extremely interesting material and very good teacher.
The first half of the course is more foundational: some basic proofs about Turing machines, time and space hierarchy theorems, NP completeness, non-uniform complexity, and randomized complexity classes. This is all neccessary knowledge for anyone interested in theory of computer science. But after that, we dove into some more recent results: interactive proofs, circuit lower bounds, and probabilistically checkable proofs. These topics were exciting and provide a more in-depth look into complexity theory.
This class is all proofs. So clearly do not take the class if you are not ready to do rigorous proofs in class, on the problem sets, and on the exams. 
But if you have the mathematical maturity to face them, don't let the proofs scare you off! Each class focused on proving a different result from complexity, and each proof was interesting and rigorous. Professor Chen is very good; he always presents clean and rigorous proofs. He doesn't dwell on trivialities, but if someone asks, he will always clarify details, both in class and office hours. He is a very clear and helpful teacher.

This class was extremely STRESSFUL and expectations are VERY VERY high. DON'T TAKE THIS CLASS AS YOUR FIRST COLLOQUIUM. I took the class because I heard amazing things about Professor Autesserre and read great reviews about her on CULPA. However, the class was by no means EASY and Professor Autesserre is by far the most intense professor I have had at Barnard/Columbia. Personally, I did not think the class was enjoyable..I was miserable and dreaded going to class every week but that was because it was my first colloquium and I didn't know/care a lot about peace building. I would not recommend taking the class unless you are a) knowledgable on the subject b) took her Civil Wars class before or c) very passionate about peacebuilding in the Congo, Rwanda or former Yugoslavia. For me, it wasn't worth stress especially over a topic that I did not feel strongly about (everyone in your 16 person class will have a lot to say on peacebuilding in Africa). However, if you are seriously considering a career at the UN or in peacebuilding/peacekeeping, Professor Autesserre is knowledgable and passionate about the subject and is extremely well-regarded and well connected in the field. 
POSITIVES:
- The class is very organized, structured and planned which ensures that writing the research paper will not be last-minute
- Professor Autesserre is impressive in her field and has great firsthand experience..she also brings in a lot of interesting speakers because she has impressive colleagues 
- You learn a lot about peacebuilding and the UN 
NEGATIVES: 
- The workload sucks and this class will definitely have to be your top priority 
- Professor Autesserre has very high expectations for quality of work, participation & preparation and is condescending if you don't meet those expectations 
- On average, you do much more work than most other colloquiums because there are the presentations, the mock negotiation/role play, etc. 
CONCLUSION: It is definitely doable but make sure that you are willing to invest a lot of time and energy into this class!

If you have no experience with Java, it's OK. The world is not going to end, but it won't be easy neither. I'm not a fan of reading but Big Java, Late Objects is one of the best books out there to learn Java. I gave my full attention to Blaer, but sometimes I would wonder off. But, it always came to taking some time to read the book and get the hang of it. Some of the answers of the Problem Sets are in the book itself. It's really important and useful that you read the book. Going to recitation doesn't make that much of a difference, unless you want to ask a question. And then again, they may even not answer them, but tell you to wait until Office Hours, since you're not the only one there. 
I had no experience with Java, got an A on the course. I am tech-savy, but it doesn't mean it's not achievable. Once you get the hang of it its pretty awesome! I do recommend taking the course with Paul. He is very funny and very lenient (we got our homework deadline extended like 3 times during the course).

Nicole was a pleasure to have as an instructor. At the beginning of the semester, she relayed to us that her forte was not in the classics, rather on queer literature, and that she would be learning with us. It was evident throughout the semester that she worked as hard as, if not harder than the students. She made sure to have one-on-one conferences about our writing throughout the process, and comfortably managed to get everyone to speak up during the seminar. Her feedback is so helpful, making clear suggestions for improvement and showing much interest in our work. She used multiple forms of media to teach in class, including mediathread (online image/art-type program), references to pop culture, a visit to the Met, and a class trip to an off-off Broadway version of A Midsummer Night's Dream. The way she pushed us to improve our skills managed to provide new lessons even for students who had already experienced the literature we were working on.
Major takeaway: Nicole is clearly interested in the work she teaches and in her students, and it is clear that she expects us to improve our skills in whatever capacity we can.

Putman's maternity leave came about midway through the semester I had with her, but her appearance in the audience of the lecture a few weeks later clearly shows her interest in the class.
She starts the lecture with an ""alien of the day"", and relates how this alien may or may not be biologically, chemically, and physically able to live in the universe in such conditions as on its planet. Examples included Superman and the alien from Avatar, etc. A kind of silly trigger for the beginning of class, it actually does provide some insight into requirements for life in the universe, which *is* the point of this class.
The material was fascinating; a combination of the three classic sciences point to possibilities for life in the universe. Sometimes it will make you feel very small, but it is this notion which, I think, makes this class all the more fascinating.
Putman uses a multiple-choice card to gauge the reception of basic concepts learned in class. She asks a question on the board, provides 4 possible answers, and the class holds up the letter of the response they think to be correct. This is a great way to get the participation of the students. Additionally, she would send out in-class assignments (usually worked on in groups or pairs) to answer a short list of questions. This would be counted as a participation grade.
Grading was fair; tests were on the material learned in class. Homeworks were occasionally more difficult than the material learned in class, but this was because they were more mathematical than the theories we learned during the lecture.

Manu is AMAZING. I honestly have never heard a major complaints from my classmates about him. He's the kind of professor that you love so much, you push yourself to do well because you don't want to let him down. He's kind, charming, and patient even when students ask dumb questions. He works hard to foster a community in his classes, even when they are on the larger side. Usually he starts the class asking if people have questions about the readings, hw, or upcoming assignments, and then he offers a space for students to make announcements about events on campus. 
He's an intellectual force who will drop knowledge bombs on you left and right. I think this is especially important since his classes often discus issues of race and American imperialism—topics that are not simple by any means. He always makes an effort to ground his statements with concrete examples, and asks us to stop him if we feel he is not being clear (which almost never happens). On days when I didn't feel like going to class I did anyway and was always glad I didn't skip. 
By far the greatest thing about him is that he wants to give you an A. As long as you don't skip too many classes, show up for the midterm and final, and do your weekly posting there is no way you can fail. He goes by a philosophy that everyone is in charge of their own education and that he is just a guide to help us better ourselves. So even if your essay is terrible, as long as it is clear a bit of effort was put in you will succeed. 
So far he is the only professor in my college experience who understands that heavy reading assignments outside of class does not translate into more knowledge. His readings are very reasonable in length, and are always relevant to the topics we are discussing in class. Because the workload is so manageable I was always able to do it and never felt drowned or overwhelmed. He is now set a standard for all my professors going forward, and honestly I don't think there is anyone who could possibly live up to him. 
I could rant and rave all day long about how great he is. No matter the subject or class title, if he is teach the course just take it. You won't regret it.

Absolute laziest professor I have ever met. He just dismissed class 40 minutes early because instead of teaching us in class for the next couple of weeks he wants to have individual meetings with us. That is ONE individual meeting for each person over the course of two weeks. It's like he doesn't have time to meet with us in addition to ""teaching"" a class. If you don't have time to teach a class, don't take the job! 
Did I mention he hasn't taught us anything about writing?In the first part of the semester he had tried to meet with us, but the conversations went on far too long and did not help. I admit, it is an American Studies UW class––but we should still be taught basic writing skills. Not only has my writing not improved, but in class we haven't gone through any tips. On top of that he did not explain to us what the P1 and P2 were actually supposed to be about. The writing style UW looks for is completely different from anything most students have experienced before, and he does not explain that to us.

I originally signed up to take her class because of the reviews below. However, its been more than halfway through the semester, I've given her a chance, and I am WRONG.
First of all, she often rude towards her students. All of us remember the one time a student asked a question, and Professor Wamsler said ""Okay....-insert smirk- now answer your own question"" with the most disrespectful and scornful look I have honestly seen any teacher give at my time in Columbia.
Grading for the class: she graded harshly for the first paper and midterm as far as I'm concerned. Best part is, she gave some people two grades, yes TWO GRADES. For an Art Hum class that meets at 8:40 am and with students who pay attention and care, she sure grades tough. She gave like one line of comments for a 5-6 page paper and something like B-/B.....what does that even mean?!......but actually....do I get a B- or a B....?
Final thoughts--I don't hate the class don't get me wrong. She is clearly knowledgeable in what she teaches and the material is interesting. However, at least from what I've heard, Art Hum and Music Hum are supposed to be lighter courses that are enjoyable. I do not enjoy this class. Because of the fact that none of us have rarely had exposure to art, writing about it is difficult. I'm so concerned about getting a low semester grade in one of the easiest core classes that I can't enjoy the material she's actually teaching. Pity

Fairly comprehensive Introductory Microbiology course. There is no Biology pre-req, but having taken Environmental Engineering with Chandran last year helped especially with kinetics. Everything pre-midterm was related to the structure, function, and replication of bacterial cells. Afterwards, it gets more relevant to Environmental Engineering, and there were many presentations and examples from Chandran's and Shashwat's (TA) own research with new bacterial genome sequencing techniques and bacterial treatments for wastewater resource recovery.
Shashwat is a better lecturer, explaning topics more clearly, and is very available for help in office hours. Chandran is very busy and can appear distracted, he's also pretty soft-spoken, so it helps to sit in the front.
Workload:
Not bad, maybe 4 total homeworks straight out of the textbook, and similar memorization-only exams. 1 Midterm, 1 final, easy grading by the TA.

""I do not provide feedback on short responses. I will provide feedback on your long posts.""
This was the response Lilla gave me when I approached him for feedback on my first short response, because I was new to the class and wanted a general idea of whether I was headed in the right direction. I should have taken it as a warning sign, but I didn't. Ultimately, I only received feedback from him once throughout entire semester, for the 3 long posts I wrote. I was not surprised, but that did not make the experience any less frustrating, especially when I had already made it clear to him that I was an international student who is new to literature. I approached him for help; he rebuffed my attempts. Imagine my frustration when he chalked my lackluster midterm performance down to the ""unfortunate fact that some students are simply more at home in the languages,"" along with some vague reference to my international background. Granted, the factors he named were probably relevant, but I would have appreciated more self-examination on his part. Lilla is also extremely vague about his expectations for the final. I completely concur with his view that the point of lit hum is to learn, rather than simply earn a good grade. However, this led to a great deal of ambiguity over the exams. For instance, he went through the entire semester claiming that he ""does not care about passage IDs."" When one of my classmates attempted to clarify his expectations regarding the exam, he told her than he ""did not want to talk about it yet."" We were eventually only provided with information on the final, on the final class before the exam. And yes, he cared about passage IDs a lot more than he let on.
Personal grievances aside, Professor Lilla led great discussions, and had brilliant insights on all the works we read. The way he approached the works from unique angles taught me a great deal about how I should approach the readings, which I really appreciated. If you're an independent learner who appreciates a good discussion, Lilla is your man. However, if you'd prefer more support, feedback, and clarity  from your professors, look elsewhere. 
Workload:
2 short posts per week, 2-3 longer posts per semester, one take-home midterm, and an in-class final. Weightages for each of these components are not provided, because Lilla thinks of exams as a necessary evil and does not want to spend more time dwelling on it than he has to.

My comments hardly differ from what has already been said about Professor Fleischer, but I will state them nonetheless. Let me start off by saying that in the classroom, Georgette is fine. She is certainly passionate about the texts she teaches and is willing to engage with students. With only a few weeks left in her classroom, I will say that she is willing to entertain most notions about the text, even if they do differ from her own. Now on to the bad…Georgette often goes off on tangents that hardly relate to the class discussion only so she can show off her knowledge of an irrelevant detail of the text. This is fine, but boring and a bit egotistic. My biggest point of distress in this class is her grading. The woman is so out of her mind, clearly she does not understand that she is teaching FIRST YEARS. Georgette acts as if we're grad students writing incredibly important pieces, when in actuality her class is required and while I'm sure some people are enthusiastic about the course, almost all of us are also in at least three other classes. First-Year English simply is not at the top of our lists! Her grading is harsh, to say the least. I don't mean the actual grade, as I find she often gives better grades than her comments imply, but the comments themselves border on hurtful. She is the first to mark everything wrong with your essay, down to simple grammar mistakes, and hardly ever has anything positive to say about it. Once again, she is teaching first years, and this technique is simply not effective with those who are already self-conscious about their writing. First-Year English is meant to help Barnard students, and while I know that a certain amount of critical reading is important, there at least needs to be a positive side. I have never received a nice comment on my work from Professor Fleischer, and I am a fairly competent writer. I am a prospective English major, and I must say, Georgette has taken all of the fun out of this class for me. Now with that being said, it is possible to survive this class. The texts are enjoyable (at least I found them so) and the class discussions are usually helpful. There are only a total of three papers due, so if you put aside your feelings and possibly your hope for an A, you will be fine. I will say, I find it deplorable that Barnard chooses to stick Georgette with first years. I understand that a First-Year English teacher is basically as low as you can get, but it's unfair.
Workload:
Not too bad. As long as you don't have to write an essay on a specific book, it's pretty easy to skip it and bullshit your way through the discussions. When it comes to paper time, though, best of luck!

The class was interesting and engaging. Professor Ochsner knows how to keep his student’s attention.  The topics covered in class (at least to me) are relevant and thoroughly explained.  There is not a ton of work that needs to be done for the class other than the group project and studying for the exams.  The group project is generally pretty easy, you design and experiment and run it on the class.  You are then graded on an individual 7-10 page paper written about it and a group oral presentation.  Warning though: you will have to study a lot for his tests to do well.  He tests you on aspects of individual experiments (although he does go through them very thoroughly in lecture), as well as giving you an unknown experiment and asking you to fix its issues, has you design your own experiment with some parameters.  The test is hard, but the experiment design question is extra credit and should boost your grade.   The tests and papers are graded by TA’s so expect to see some very nit-picky critiques but just do what they say and you’ll be fine in the end.  ALSO LISTEN TO THIS!!! If you take his class you have to go to lecture to understand what is happening. His slides are basically gibberish if you don’t hear what he has to say about them. It is worth it though because it’s only one day a week and a good class!

BORING yet also easy. His lectures are horrible. He is unorganized and confused half the time himself.  However, he is a very cute old man that shows a lot of videos and there is a ginormous curve.  The only thing you really have to do to study for the class is fill out his study questions and know them backwards and forwards.  Also for the essay part of the test write a ton. He’ll say write as much as you need but ignore that advice and vomit everything you know onto the blue book and you’ll do better than if you actually make a structured argument.  The multiple choice questions can sometimes be worded strangely but he tries to account for this by letting you throw out 2-3 questions per test depending on how many questions there are.  Also, there is the occasional homework assignment that if you put even the slightest amount of effort into you’ll get a “great!” written as feedback.

he majored in philosophy as an undergrad, so his lecture is 100% theory, 0% what is on the problem sets.  he also refused to coordinate with the recitation TA on problem sets, so they virtually never matched up with lecture, to the point where we had a problem set due the week after the midterm that covered material he taught the day before the midterm.. material that was on the midterm.  if you look up how to do the problem sets on chegg or whatever you can do the homework pretty easily, otherwise prepare to spend the first half of the semester staring at questions you have no idea how to solve (second half is easier, bc its straightforward stuff like market demand/supply, monopolies, etc).  munasinghe is super condescending during lecture and picks apart any answer he is given in class.  grading on the homework is incredibly harsh given that we never learn how to solve them in class, and homework were return LITERALLY MONTHS after they were due.  This may be due to the fact that the grader (who was different from the TA and the lecturer) was a new parent, but cmon, I need problem sets back that cover the midterm material BEFORE the midterm, not over a month after.  Its a doable class, but i dreaded going to every single lecture.

I had such high hopes for this class. Both professors are current directors at Bell Labs, so you'd think they would be extremely knowledgeable about cloud computing and be able to teach a lot about how what's going on in real-world networking today.
But on the first day of class each professor started by saying that teaching is only their hobby --- and boy does it show. Each of them were terrible in their own way. Sabnani seemed like he actually cared and wanted to help students, he just didn't know how to do that in an effective manner. His attempts at stimulating class participation consisted of asking ""How many of you have heard of _____?"" type questions. But on the rare occasion when students cared enough to ask questions, he would genuinely try to answer them. Thomas Woo, on the other hand, gave the impression that he did not care about students at all. Anytime a student would ask a question, he seemed incapable of understanding why they would even need to ask a question, and treated people like an idiot for needed to ask something. And he completely shut down answers that he disagreed with. 
Homeworks and tests were a disaster as well. There was terrible communication between both the professors and the TA for the class. This resulted in questions that had nothing to do with any of the material covered in lectures. The problems themselves also defy naming conventions and standards used in every other computer science class, making understanding what the questions are even asking difficult. For example, in a question about calculating RSA, the professors switched around the names of the variables to the opposite of how every intro crypto lecture in CS teaches them. 
The midterm and final were a throwback to middle school-style tests. They consisted of various fill-in-the-blank and true/false questions but in a way that did zero to test for understanding of concepts in favor of pure memorization. The emphasis given to memorizing what different acronyms stand for instead of what they actually mean or what significance they play was astounding. Why does it matter if I can name what the T in REST stands for if I can explain what REST as a whole means and how it's used?
Workload:
Light workload. 4 homeworks, and one semester-long project (either programming project, research paper, or analysis of a real-world system). If you choose the research paper, it's very easy. Not sure about the other two choices.

George Lewis is a great guy. Funny, likeable, idiosyncratic... he is a maverick.
That doesn't mean he's a good teacher. In fact, he's definitely not a good teacher.
George Lewis does not care about this class. It's really, really far down his priorities list. That was evident from his periodical, unexplained absences, as well as the fact that we rarely spend even 1h of the 1h30 class time discussing or analysing the assigned readings. But what I also got from this class is that, if you've done the readings that he assigns, everything he says makes sense. 
He's a bit of a ""sideman"" but also kind of a big deal. He knows that, and although he might not want you to know that, it's pretty obvious from the moment he sits down. George Lewis is there because he needs to be.... this is what it has come to.
But he also provides his students with absolute pearls, hilarious stories and generally a real attempt at discussion with his students. He also cares about what you have to say. Even though he knows he's better, he also has a child-like curiosity that means that his knowledge is never used against the student to overwhelm. 
So the class is fun. George Lewis is an excellent character. Always good-humored and he shows a real interest in what we have to say, opening up the floor for discussion throughout his classes.
The only problem is that it's very unclear as to whether he wants to be there, or whether he's making jokes because he doesn't care enough about the reading to discuss them with us. Or maybe he's only there for the sake of it, to make his jokes and earn his pay-check. 
All of this to arrive at the real problem with George Lewis's class: his grading method.
For a professor who doesn't seem to care about anything, he is certainly tough and even harsh in his grading method.
Students are expected to know everything, but are taught almost nothing.
Overall, I think this is the only glaring problem. He's entertaining enough that I didn't care much about not discussing the readings, and arguably that made my life easier because it was one less class to worry about throughout the semester.

Professor Morris is pretty down to earth, very approachable and welcoming when you visit her in office hours. She brought chocolate which she passed around during the midterm and final. The readings were light and consistent for this course, not too bad. I have to admit though that this was one of the driest courses I have ever taken. The lectures consist of you going from site to site, talking about what has been unearthed there and a few ideas concerning its use at the time. I had a friend who was going to visit Egypt so he was doing research of his own on places to visit and he would ask me about them to see what I had learned from class and almost always they were places we had not discussed in lecture. This is not a course for the academic tourist, rather its seems to be geared towards those students who are really very interested in archaeology and getting into the details of the lives of the people instead of large impressive monuments. I really wanted to learn more about the pyramids which are so unbelievable in the manner in which they were constructed that I was hoping to spend quite a bit of time on that but, alas, we breezed through them in half a class during the first few weeks. At the end of the day I don't really feel like I learned much from this course which will be useful going forward, I do feel like I learned a lot of things that would be useful if I were going into the field of Egyptian Archeology, however. I recommend going to the first two weeks of this class, if you like the pace and material of those first two weeks, the rest of the semester stays pretty much the same.

He cancelled class for two weeks and serially fails to show up to appointments he sets up with students--appointments that he requires us to make.  He does not care about the students at all.
Class discussions are dry and the reading material often doesn't even fit the American Studies theme of the course.  Judith Butler?? Sure, she was American, but I thought we would be reading things about America, not simply by American authors.
Nick does not teach us anything.  My writing has not improved at all through this class.  It is a complete waste of time, and he always waits until less than a week before the final draft is due to give you any feedback.

I cannot sing Rieder's praises enough! He seriously cares about his students and makes time to meet with each student in his seminars personally to revise/brainstorm their essays. He is passionate about his areas of research, and is genuinely interested in people (refreshing and unfortunately too rare for sociologists). I will emphasize that he is much better in seminar format than lecture; it's a more manageable format for the types of discussions he tries to have. He is not super-organized, which can be frustrating, but I still think his classes are very worth it, for his expertise and the questions he makes you consider.

He will stop after finishing theorems and examples and literally wait quite some time to make sure you understand and have no more questions. His homework is fair and easy.

Lauren is super sweet and cute, but she has no understanding of the workload she assigns.  yes she is nice and accommodating, but she doesn't understand that in order to do the work you have to be dedicating time to go over to the studio, so assigning more than one painting per week is already too much, plus there were ten sketchbook assignments per week, and a reading, and a writing response to the reading.  it was just WAY too much work and she didn't listen when we told her so.  
In addition, she barely gave any critical feedback n the actual work.  her style was to let us work independently during class with little to no commentary from her.  it was basically come in to class, talk about last weeks assignment for about an hour, then work independently with quiet music n the background for the next five hours. it was not very exciting. as an artist, I was hoping for a more enriching experience in this class but definitely didn't learn much at all.

I took this class senior spring to fulfill the Global Core elective. I truly despised this class, and I dislike the Global Core requirement in general for how it completely lacks direction and does not fulfill its purpose.
This class was a small discussion class twice a week that was in Casa Hispanica (painfully far from EC) in which attendance was mandatory. No one ever spoke (or quite frankly touched the reading, which could have been very interesting if the professor could in any way teach it) and when people did you could tell it was just to get their participation grade up. 
This class was my least favorite kind of joke class: just persistent enough that you had to stay semi checked in to do well. I much prefer the kind where if the class does not give you a reason to take it seriously, it acknowledges this by allowing you to gracefully not show up. 
Grading was totally arbitrary as I knew many people who got 95/100 on the midterm and the final seemed to be graded on improvement rather than performance.
For context Patricia Grieve runs the Global Core requirement department (or whatever it's called). She is a professor of Spanish literature. This class was, except for Arabian nights, entirely focused on European literature and culture (we read Cervantes and Chaucer, for example). I do not know why it counted as a Global Core course except that she is the one who gets to make those decisions. She is also the one who decided that some History and Econ courses about Asia (among others, I'm sure) do not count as courses about ""non-Western culture.""
Imagine that, another white person pretending to be an educator of non-Western cultures by teaching Western culture.

Professor van Gorkom is one of my favorite professors at Columbia. She was incredibly approachable, easy to speak to, and she was also very interested in the subject matter. She is an accomplished radio-astronomer and she often speaks about how her own work relates to the things that we discuss in class. I found the class very easy, and the problem sets interesting as well. Maybe the fact that this class is so enjoyable and the things that we discussed were so interesting made me form a bias in favor of this professor, but I honestly think that she is one of the sweetest, most genuine, and quite frankly hilarious, professors that I have ever had. I hope that I can take another class from her in the future. If you have the opportunity to take this class, please do it. You don't even have to go to class to get a decent grade (based on several friends that skipped often), but I think you will find the material so interesting that you won't want to miss it.

TL/DR: Go for it!  The class, professor, and even major program are all fantastic.
Professor Shapiro is hands-down one of the best professors I have ever had -- the best so far.  The only reason she isn't the best is I have yet to finish all my degrees.  This is a good thing.  She cares about her students and lives to teach.  
Are her classes difficult?  Yes.  Does she have specific and strict rules regarding electronics and general classroom respect?  Yup.  Are her classes amazing?  Absolutely.
While, yes, you will likely have to memorize ALL of your notes for her classes (especially Human Origins), it is a genuine pleasure to do so. 
Here is an example of how great her classes are:  I had surgery one semester right before finals.  I was taking Human Origins that semester.  I woke up from anesthesia and one of my friends/classmates in Human Origins was there to help me get home.  What did I do before they even took the IV out of my arm?  Started drilling Human Origins flashcards with my friend, of course.  I didn't have to -- I knew my stuff and so did she -- but I WANTED to.  Professor Shapiro kindles a kind of respect in her students that they simply cannot bear to let her down.  
Of note, Prof. Shapiro is the major coordinator for the Evolutionary Biology of the Human Species (AKA Physical/Biological Anthropology) program as well.  A better coordinator could not exist.  Take Human Origins early to see if you like it -- the major is great and often missed until it is too late!
If you are on the fence, give Prof. Shapiro and her Human Origins class a shot.  As long as you work for the classes you pay for, you will have one of the best experiences in your college life.

TL/DR: Take his class, any class, if and whenever possible.
David.  Ah, David.  Pronounced Dah-veed, it is a name that you will always remember if you take one of his classes.  In a good way.
David is a fantastic teacher.  He has a very laid-back, free-flowing teaching style with lots of humor mixed in, yet he manages to, well, manage the class extremely well.  For example, one class, we ended up discussing vegan-ism for nearly forty minutes, arguing back and forth across the circular seating arrangement -- all in Espanol, of course -- and David STILL was able to interrupt at key points and get the components of his lecture in.  While not every class was like this, his keen ability to adjust to the fluidity of a small, immersive, foreign language class was just amazing.
Oh did I forget to mention that?  Yes, his classes are Spanish-speaking only and very participation heavy.  That's OK though; the class time will disappear in no time flat.
How much did I enjoy his class?  Well my wife visited me one Friday for the first time in five weeks -- and she and I get along quite well -- but by-golly I still went to David's class that morning.  Did I have to?  No.  Did I want to?  You betchya.
If I didn't have to return to Seattle this summer I would take his Intermediate 1 course.  Even then, I am tempted to stay.  Just for his teaching.

Professor Rosen is an excellent teacher, and her strengths are particularly well-suited to Lit Hum. Her class is constantly and consistently engaging, interesting, and even fun. I'll go into a lot of detail about her class, which will probably sound dry at times; that's simply a function of my extended analysis and poor prose. Her class is absolutely fantastic, and was an incredible introduction to the Core here at Columbia. She is highly recommended, and deserves even better than the silver nugget she has currently.
A disclaimer before I begin: Obviously, a lot of the quality of a Lit Hum class depends on the students - if they're all quiet, the class likely won't be enjoyable, no matter how great the teacher. I was lucky enough to have a relatively lively class, where at least 10 people spoke in any given class period, rather than 3 or fewer people making all the contributions. On the other hand, both by making a large chunk of the grade (30%) based on class participation, and with her easy and engaging manner, Margo definitely brings out the best in her students.
Professor Rosen's class is focused on close reading. Her essays are all exercises in that skill: to get a good grade, simply mine the passage for the tiniest linguistic details that the author might have placed to make a larger point, then make the larger point yourself in the conclusion. Afterwards, go back and write an introduction that leads naturally to your analysis and conclusion; she's a stickler for writing the intro AFTER the rest of your paper.
Margo is an absolute joy in class; she comes to every session smiling and spends the entirety of each class jumping off into tangentially related analyses of the text that keep both her and her students excited. Because of her emphasis on close-reading, Professor Rosen's classes tend to be a series of 10-20 minute stops at different self-contained places in the book. For instance, you might spend 15 minutes on a particular juicy scene in Crime & Punishment, without making reference to much of the surrounding book (besides the places in which language from the part you're analyzing gets repeated). Then, after both class and professor have exhausted (or nearly exhausted) their analysis of the symbolism, sentence structure, metaphor use, and other features of that particular section, Professor Rosen will nudge the class towards a different passage, later in the book. As such, her class isn't so much a review or exploration of the books as a whole, but a tiny taste of what truly deep mining of the text can net you in particular places in each book. (Close reading!)
Professor Rosen is a Slavic literature buff by trade, but that doesn't stop her from being immensely and obviously excited and knowledgeable about all the works on the syllabus. Perhaps her biggest weakness is that she doesn't have a lot of background knowledge on the historical circumstances surrounding the books beyond the notes she prepares for class; however, if you ask a question she doesn't know the answer to, she'll always research it and bring the answer to the next class. She truly cares about her students; she'll often try to organize fun activities with her class's event funds. For instance, she might take the class to a performance of one of the plays you read, or have a trip to the Cloisters, or organize an out-of-class review session for the final with pizza or at Symposium (she'll let you vote on what to do with the funds, but she has plenty of good suggestions). She also has a 10-minute break built in to the middle of her 110 minutes, and she'll try to organize a signup list where each week, a different member of the class brings a snack. Small, cute things like that don't really impact the class, but are certainly a nice touch from a veteran, All-Star Lit Hum teacher.
As far as grading goes, Professor Rosen will generally give poorer grades on the first paper than later ones; this is explained by the fact that she doesn't give a 'discount' at the beginning of the semester to account for the fact that students don't yet know how to write her close-reading-heavy preferred paper-type. As you learn how to write the type of paper she likes, your grade will improve; don't be afraid when the majority of the class receives C-range grades on the first paper. Margo is generally a pretty easy grader when it comes to your final grade; her final A-range is usually around 40%. The grading breakdown varies, but is generally something like:
First paper - 15%
Midterm - 15%
Second paper - 20%
Final - 20%
Class participation and Google doc - 30%
The Google doc assignment is one that takes place before each class. Each student has to find a particularly poignant or loaded quote from the assigned reading for that class, post it to the Google doc for that particular class session along with a thought-provoking question about the quote, and answer someone else's question. While the minimum is one quote and one response, quality and quantity are both good things here (and both can make up for a poor class participation record, if you realize you're not speaking up as much as you should be).
Professor Rosen's emphasis on close-reading extends to her tests. Instead of simply asking you to identify the work, author, and context of a quote, Professor Rosen asks that you analyze the quote and list as many features as you can find in the quote that are indicative of what work it comes from. For instance, whether it is poetry or prose, what sort of narration it includes, what themes might emerge from its content, etc. This different method for passage ID's means both that your passage ID's will take much longer than other classes' (which is why you'll be given fewer of them), and that less of your grade is dependent on simply knowing quotes (instead, you need to know the FEATURES of each work that define it and separate it from others). Be aware that you won't get back your papers or tests quickly - it'll often take upwards of a month. You'll almost always get back a paper before the next one is due though, and the midterm before the final happens.
Professor Rosen is unafraid to give her own interpretations of symbols in a book once the class has given its analysis. Although she's an incredible facilitator (be careful - if you so much as scratch your nose, she'll assume you're raising your hand!), she'll also tell you her own view of the texts. She'll make it very clear when this view is her own and not necessarily shared by her colleagues, but her theories are often eye-opening, provocative, and extremely intriguing. Many of these theories come into play later in the second semester, as she really enters her zone of expertise - especially surrounding Crime & Punishment and To The Lighthouse.
Speaking of specific books, Professor Rosen isn't afraid to monkey with the standard Lit Hum syllabus. She doesn't like Sappho, for instance, and this year she removed it and Ovid's Heroides in favor of Ovid's Metamorphoses (which I personally think was a wonderful decision). She's been teaching Lit Hum for a long time (She once mentioned a class she taught in 2002, I think), and she tends to lean towards the classic elements of the syllabus as opposed to the new additions. (With that said, the last book she teaches is almost always the graphic novel Maus, which hasn't ever been on the official Lit Hum syllabus to my knowledge.)
Professor Rosen will never agree to have class outside - she finds it distracting and she makes good use of the blackboard - but she gives off the sort of fun vibe that makes even books you've read and disliked in the past seem fascinating and deep when she teaches them. She'll breathe new life into the dusty old classics, and if you pay attention, she can make books you'd never have considered enjoyable feel like some of the best in history - which, after all, they are; that's why they're on her syllabus.
Workload:
Two or three 3-page papers per semester, in which you analyze a single passage (lots of emphasis on close reading); the last paper each semester might include an option (or requirement) to analyze and compare TWO passages in 4-6 pages instead.
In addition, there are mandatory posts to a class Google Docs page before each class - you have to find a quote from the assigned reading, ask a question about it, and answer someone else's question. If you've done the reading, the whole exercise shouldn't take more than 15 minutes.
Also the usual in-class midterm and Lit Hum final, although Professor Rosen will generally amend the passage ID's to have fewer questions but require longer responses, as I note above.

I have been working with Christina Ciocca on a longitudinal, in-depth, qualitative research study for the duration of the year. While this is a review that is unique to our situation, I also wanted to speak to her abilities as an instructor and supervisor. The study lies in the intersection between sociology and education, which are both areas that Christina is very passionate and knowledgeable about. Christina has gone above and beyond as my supervisor. I had never conducted interviews before beginning work on her study, and Christina took the time to train me in best practices for qualitative interviews. At the same time it is important to point out that she is not a micro-manager; Christina demonstrated complete faith that I would take care of my responsibilities and complete work of a good standard. This made me more confident and allowed me to learn throughout the process. Christina also has taken the time to educate me in other areas of sociological research that may not pertain to this study, but in which I expressed interest, including quantitative coding and analysis with software. She is able to navigate this because she is proficient in mixed-methods, which is rare and valuable in the department! Christina sees the value of both qualitative and quantitative work and is able to expertly utilize both methods to conduct important research and produce exciting data. Christina was always super accessible for questions, support or advice. She is also enthusiastic and relatable. I would highly recommend taking any class that Christina offers, because her passion and knowledge should be shared!

I just wanted to say that I absolutely agree with all the previous reviews: Margo is warm, caring, wonderfully professorial in that frazzled, excitable sort of way, and an excellent teacher. There's no point in restating all the points the old reviews say; they all still hold perfectly true. Professor Rosen is an EXCELLENT Lit Hum teacher.
A note on her essays: the close-reading point still holds true. You need to focus in on one passage and analyze it with little reference to the book as a whole. She's also big on being concise and cutting out fluff - the ""bullshit"" line that an older review mentioned seems to be part of a yearly trope she uses. If you follow that advice, though, it's not hard to get a good grade on your papers. Just have a point to your essay, back it up with details in the passage you're analyzing, allude to the point in your intro, and make the point in your conclusion.

She lesson plans very well and almost always makes sure that we arrive at a *light-bulb moment* conclusion without making you feel too over guided. On top of that she is sweet. smart and funny. Our class had a great dynamic and she often felt more like a friend than a professor. If its any indication the whole class stayed for the second semester.

-Wiki post - You have to do a wikipost before each class on the reading, basically a couple sentences on an online forum (no word count, get to miss two)
-Invocation and study guide - You sign up for a class and for that class you have to present and invocation (can be very short, most do just show youtube clips). You also have to take notes and make a study guide for that class.

First off, Glasenapp is a nice and approachable guy nice. With that being said, this was without a doubt the hardest class I've taken in my life to date (and my GPA now reflects that). As a global core, music humanities should not be as hard as Glasenapp made it. He's definitely passionate in this subject (which is why he is pursuing a PhD in it) and while that is admirable, he fails to realize most (all) of the kids in his class do not share that same passion. If you have not studied/played music your whole life and don't want most of your studying to be in music hum then there's not a shot in hell you'll get a good grade. If classical music is your passion, then you will probably do alright in this class. Not because you'll be able to cruise by, but because you'll be willing to put in the work necessary to get that grade. For example, there was a kid who plays and studied classical music that actually dropped the class more than halfway through the course, and then there's the kid who played and studied classical music who got an A but did all the readings and what not. He is a relatively harsh grader and doesn't care if you've never seen an instrument in your life. He will grade you just as harsh as the kids who have grown up around classical music and assumes dense and complicated information is common knowledge because he's so knowledgeable. While I'm trying to memorize and recognize 30 songs from 6 different composers for a mid term, a friend of mine who's taking the same course at the same time in a different section is memorizing 6 songs by 3 composers. He commonly mocks other music hum professors who take the course more lightly. Beware.

The best professor I've had at Columbia. Hands down. No questions asked. You are incredibly lucky if you get her for Lit Hum. She is brilliant, intelligent, and easy to work with outside of the classroom. She has written me recommendation letters, and we still maintain a relationship after class. She began every class with an overview of the history of the work we were reading at the time and maintained a class discussion quite well, even from 6:10-8 in a residence hall classroom. She made me stimulated to go to class, and brought cookies three times throughout the semester and Swedish Fish for the midterm and final. This is the most I've learned throughout my time at Columbia in my first semester of my first-year. Go into her outside of the classroom and any time that you can. You will learn so much from her if you put in the work and let her know that you are willing and able to create an outside of the classroom relationship. She is so deserving of her golden nugget.

Krauss is one of the most reputable art historians of our time. I am so glad that I got the opportunity to take her class. Sometimes her lectures are difficult to understand, and there may be some blatant topic that was not fleshed out enough and everyone wants to ask a really blatant question about it, but at times no one does because it can be intimidating. Yet when she is on point, she is one of the (if not the) best lecture teachers I have ever seen. She points out numerous theories on artworks that you may have previously thought could never connect. Such an amazing class, I would highly recommend it.
The TAs usually control your grades, so it all depends on whether or not you get a good TA. Luckily, my TA was completely understanding and AMAZING.
Sometimes the discussion sections can get boring because no one reads, but if you read they should be almost as exciting as the lectures.
It is manageable to get an A- on the exams by just studying the powerpoint and terms list (they provide a powerpoint of all of the artworks you could possibly need to know).
The textbook for this class is by far my favorite I have ever read. Period. 
It's written by Krauss and some other art historians, and if I discovered it earlier I would have read it on my leisure time. I usually don't like reading extensively, so this gives you an idea.

Evan is EXCELLENT. This course was by far my favorite last semester and that was largely because he was my instructor. He encouraged us to speak in every class and was always very forgiving and helpful when mistakes were made. His feedback on written assignments was very thorough, and work was almost always returned the following lecture. He clearly put a great deal of time and effort into correcting our work and made sure we knew WHY we were incorrect when we were. He also made sure to explain topics very thoroughly in his lectures, and gave us plenty of opportunities to ask questions. 
The class was taught entirely in German, which was very helpful to immersion (albeit a bit intimidating) but also led to some comical moments when he had to explain things without using English. Evan was always friendly and unintimidating,and stayed after class to discuss any additional questions we might have had. He also responded to questions via email very promptly. I have no complaints regarding his teaching--he truly is excellent.
I still see him around campus sometimes and we chat, he really does care about his students. After the final he took the class to a German museum and treated us to coffee! 
All said, I feel more confident speaking German after one semester of this course than I did after 3 years of high school Spanish.

Professor Vizcarra is literally the kindest and sweetest professor ever. The Barnard Chemistry department is lucky to have her. She is an absolute breath of fresh air. Take any class that she offers! She is fair and even though the material is hard she will make time to see you to clarify any doubts!

Mariana is one of the most fantastic professors I've ever had. Mariana’s classes have made me a better writer, and not just in Spanish. Her teaching style very much encourages you to crystallize your thoughts and express them in a clear, easy-to-follow manner. Her classes are some of the few that taught me to be a better student, and not just within the context of the class material. She is extremely dedicated to the growth of her students and continually makes herself available to talk after class, meet in person, and answer emails. 
Mariana's classes are FUN. I can't image how much preparation goes into her curriculum, because her group discussions and exercises never stopped impressing me. She really wants you to engage with the class material and dig deep into it by asking good questions.

It depends what class you take with her, but there were 3-5, short writing assignments (~3 pages) and the reading was manageable, perhaps an hour of reading for every class. The final paper was ~8 pages.

Do not take Professor Miller's class. Worst professor I've had at Columbia.
1. Syllabus
The syllabus for this class was basically useless. His outline for the course showed how much effort he put into in organizing the course; it was just a list of the chapters from the textbook that you had to read, without any clear distinction as to which chapters will be covered in which lectures. It was no different from the textbook's table of contents. It didn't have any dates, and towards the end, he didn't even bother listing the page numbers you had to read for the chapters. It simply said ""TBD."" He only updated the class on the syllabus when people asked and made requests on Piazza by saying read the rest of the textbook. 
2. Lectures + PPT slides
After the first couple lectures, I felt like the ppt slides for the lectures were made literally the night before. The PPT slides had SO MANY ERRORS - typos and incorrect explanations of economic models. A TA had to point out that Prof Miller's slides were wrong during a review session, and before quizzes, people flooded Piazza asking for clarifications on the slides. 
The lectures and slides also did not cover all that was in the readings, which was frustrating because you didn't know what to focus on for quizzes and exams. Also, I felt like he put in a lot unnecessary information - stuff that wasn't even in the textbook, didn't need to know for the class, but was just there, because it was something that he knew and we didn't. Completely useless. 
2. Quizzes and Exams 
Again, his quizzes and exams were poorly written just as his syllabus and ppt slides were. And it was pretty clear that he wrote the tests at the last minute before the announced exam dates , because every time he announced there will be a quiz next week, he gave the most vague answers as to what the format of the quiz is going to be and what the quiz will cover. Although the tests were not that difficult and straightforward, it was so frustrating to study for them because you just didn't know (and obviously he didn't know as well because he hadn't made them yet) what to study for. 
And the MIDTERM - THE HORROR STORY.
What kind of professor doesn't even make sure that he has enough copies of the exam for the class? Half of the class didn't get a midterm, because there weren't enough copies for everyone. If Prof Miller (or the TA's) had acted quickly and professional enough to resolve the issue, it wouldn't have been that bad and this story wouldn't be here. But when Prof Miller asked ""how many of you didn't get an exam?"" and more than half of the class raised their hands, what he said was something like, ""Oh, there should be enough. I printed 10 extra."" And then, what he did was just go on his laptop (?) trying to figure something out or whatever he was doing, while the entire class just sat there waiting for instructions. Those who were lucky with the exams were looking through the questions and discussing it with whoever was sitting next to them. The TAs warned the students to stop talking and to leave the exams faced down, but the class had 100+ people in it, so that of course was not an efficient or smart way of handling the problem. Prof Miller decided to re-collect the exams only when a TA suggested that they do so, which unfortunately, was another fail, because the extra copies arrived when the TA's had already begun collecting the exams back. Complete BS and a waste of time. 
Prof Miller should really put in more effort and time into his classes. The experience I had being in his class was just not worth the time nor the money I paid Columbia for it.

If you have Prof Marcus for CC, you are very lucky. She might be scary at first, and requires written responses emailed in before every class (with citations!) but this is to make sure the majority of the class has a good enough understanding to have a good discussion.
She leads discussions amazingly well. Even if I barely got a text reading it myself, I always came out of a class with a much better understanding of the author's argument, assumptions, weaknesses, and how it relates to broader issues. I took this class spring 2014, and now looking back and reading some of my responses and essay, I realize how much the class has prepared me for other philosophy courses by teaching me how to think creatively. Prof Marcus really brings out the best of her students!
This being said, the workload is definitely heavier than other CC courses, but you will be rewarded for your work. If you are interested in philosophy and willing to put in effort, this class is for you. If you want to blow-off CC class, then it's not. This class probably embodies what the Columbia core wants to do for its students.
Prof Marcus also stays after class every time if you have questions for her. She's pretty accessible despite being the dean of humanities, but if you want to meet her outside class you'll have to schedule and not just drop in.

Jushan Bai's econometrics class is a solid class. Not mindblowingly amazing, but if I had to take econometrics again I would definitely take it with him. 
He's passionate about the topic but his lectures are still dry. If you're good at reading textbooks, then you'd be fine skipping, but all the material covered in homework and exams is covered in lecture so I think I saved a lot of time studying by attending most lectures. Prof Bai is also very helpful in office hours, so if you're having trouble or have any questions about the psets, he'll answer them for you. 
The workload was very reasonable and I didn't find it difficult despite not having a very solid foundation in statistics. He reviewed the topics we used (like hypothesis testing) at the beginning of the course, and I'd probably have been fine without having taken any statistics in the past. He provides wonderful pdf notes reviewing probability and statistics, which were super useful. The psets didn't involve that much R (I've heard horror stories about other classes and Stata) and were manageable.
Overall, a medium level difficulty class with a pretty dedicated professor, and possibly one of the best metrics classes at Columbia.

I liked Professor Higonnet—her lectures were clear. The workload is fairly manageable—she recommends that you do the reading, but honestly, I did no reading at all and did very well on my midterm. All this class requires in terms of testing is memorization, and if you don't go to lecture, make sure to look up the key works (3 or 4 per class) and write down historical significance/any other important information.  I skipped 1/3 of the lectures, maybe more, and did great, but I did go to discussion section every week.  The essays are not as easy, but if you pay attention to her methods of analyzing the art work, you will do fine—just stand in front of the assigned art for an hour and jot down everything that comes to mind.
Take the testing advice with a grain of salt, because memorization is my forte.  If you aren't good at that, you will have a hard time on the midterm and final.

I really liked Professor Coen—her lectures were clear, informative, and I was rarely (if ever) bored.  With that said, if you space out for a few minutes, you will miss information, because she doesn't put the main ideas on the powerpoint on the board.  Buy the textbook—it will fill in any gaps that lecture might leave, especially towards the end of the semester—she runs out of time occasionally. 
In terms of workload, the essay for this class was a royal pain in the butt—it was a 5-7 page paper about a historical novel chosen from a list of 6 or 7 books.  It was spread out over a month and a half, and I wasn't able to finish the novel within 3 weeks like I wanted to in order to start planning the essay.  Other than that, the readings are fairly light, but they are necessary, since discussion sections focus heavily on the readings 5x per semester.  I tried to not do the readings, but after going to the first discussion and realizing how vital they were to the class, I did them religiously.  The midterm is fairly easy—just follow your notes, the lecture outlines and key terms she gives you, and use the textbook.

I really liked Professor Ciolkowski—she was so helpful, nice and bubbly, and I loved hearing her thoughts about the texts we read.  A lot of people, for whatever reason, don't love her lectures, but I do.
This class is the hardest class I have taken, by far.  The reading for this class is unreasonably heavy—at least 200 pages per week, and you must read closely or else you won't be able to do the weekly writing assignment, which is also super lengthy.  The midterm is fairly hard, but as long as you read the texts carefully and can summarize the arguments, you'll be fine.  Also, the class is a pain because you have to do event reports twice a week.  
Overall, the workload shouldn't deter you from taking this class, but be prepared for an insane workload, and maybe take one less class that semester (i.e. 4 instead of 5).  I learned so much from this class, and I feel infinitely more informed about women and gender issues, as well as race.  This class really opened my eyes to the issues in the world.

Illya Kun is an amazing professor, and I am really glad I took a class with him. You can tell he really cares about his students, and whether his students are learning or not. The class atmosphere was very upbeat, and you felt free to ask questions about even the most random of things (like dozens of different words for hats, or the usage difference between a perfective and imperfective word, or what some random slang you heard in a song means). He doesn't give up on students, which I think is even more important for small classes like those in the Russian language department. Illya puts in the extra effort to help all of his students succeed, and I really appreciated that, given how difficult a language Russian is. Plus, he's funny, and has lots of interesting cultural stories about Soviet Russia, and Ukraine, so you'll learn not only about the Russian language, but the culture as well.
If Russian is not super easy for you, but you are invested in getting better, you should definitely take a class with Illya. He's very good at recognizing what a student knows and doesn't know, and helping accordingly. But not in the kind of way that makes you lazy. If you are already really good at Russian, or the kind of student who likes a more focused, regimented kind of class, you might be *slightly* annoyed at how often the class will digress into discussions that are fascinating and highly technical, but not ultimately useful for your grade. These digressions, though, are wonderfully informative.
Workload:
Russian itself is a very difficult language, and since the Columbia admins have it in their heads that you will be fluent in two years, the workload reflects that. I don't feel like Illya ever gave us an unfair amount of homework. Plus, he is very understanding and will cut you some slack, provided you are a good student and deserve slack. You're a good student, right? Right? Good, nothing to worry about.
You have anywhere from half an hour to an hour of work a day, depending on how good at Russian you are and the workload. Weekends, you have about an hour. You'll find it's very similar to your first year of Russian in terms of workload, though the material might be easier. The whole first semester is basically vocab you already know.

While I found this class very challenging, I have been highly rewarded for my hard work.  I've noticed that the professor deliberately presented difficult material in order to weed out the weaker students.  Those of us that stayed on board were in for quite a treat.  His early slides were somewhat disorganized, if only to throw some of us off the scent.  After the first few weeks, it really got cooking.  Too often we Economics majors are patronized by professors that teach to the lowest common denominator.  If you are serious about the study and research of markets, Professor Che is a must have.  What I would never have expected is the joy and humor that Professor Che revealed on our take-home exam.  Hint: do the last problem first- it will save you a lifetime.  Call me a sycophantic try-hard, but I would even say the professor was pretty cute.  He brought candy to class, couldn't stop smiling, and cracked some side-splitters.  When he invited the entire class to dinner, we met his wonderful and warm family.  The eldest, undeserving son was far from a chip off the old block, the youngest had the humorous countenance of his father, and his wife was a dreamy dime piece.  No surprises there- he teaches so well he should have a lion's pride of wives (#LionPride).

I found Professor Kesler to be a great lecturer. The class itself was very informative about inequality in the United States. While we didn't get to delve very deeply into all of the subjects, it was a great overview of how the US compares to other countries in terms of socioeconomic, class, race, gender, healthcare, and other forms of inequality. Professor Kesler uses PowerPoint slides in lecture that are very organized and helpful for tests, and she is very open to helping students. She seems to be very kind and to care about the students and their opinions a lot.
The class has a pretty solid amount of reading, but it's not necessarily imperative that the reading gets done. There are activities in class that center on the readings, but they usually involve group work or opinion responses and are only graded for completion. I found most of the readings interesting anyways, so I enjoyed doing them. There are two relatively short research-based papers, and Professor Kesler offers a lot of help with them. The midterm is take-home but you have to do it during the class period (submit it online and take it wherever you want with open-notes). It wasn't awful. The grading is done partly by Professor Kesler and partly by the TA, and I found it to be very fair if not somewhat generous.
Overall, I would definitely recommend this class if you are considering sociology or interested in learning about inequality in the US. It definitely broadened my perspectives and made me interested in sociology.

He begins with class everyday rocking in his chair like your typical grandpa, and briefs us about each author. It is obvious he is very well-read, has his own perspective on each of the others. After an introduction, he usually asks for our opinions. Most people haven't read the material or don't know what to say about it, and Billows doesn't mind continuing talking by himself.
We spend most of the class debating a lot of contemporary issues. So if that's problem for anyone, this isn't the class for you then. However, Billows is able to tie back those issues to the text, and draw some interesting conclusions. I have probably put in zero work (besides essays), but I've walked away learning something substantial.

Julia was awesome. She pushed me to be a better writer and thinker. 
Her feedback on all my essays was extremely detailed, and also went way beyond simple line edits and asked me to clarify my thinking or expand on different ideas. I love how I could always meet with Julia about feedback, and she was always able to discuss things I found confusing (e.g. a Butler essay we read). Trust me, meet with her weekly! It will drastically improve the quality of your writing. Plus, I promise you she's easy to talk to and just a really interesting, kind person, even though it might seem scary to talk to a professor at first. 
I've never been comfortable with analytical writing before this class; I came away feeling comfortable and, dare I say, enjoying it. For reference, I don't care about grades, but I think it's relevant to point out I've never gotten an A-range grade on an analytical essay in my entire life, counting high school, so I really, really didn't have a grasp on what I was doing, nor did I look forward to analytical writing before because I felt like I was worthless at it. And to be clear, I'm not saying Julia is an easy grader — I just felt more comfortable with what I was doing, and enjoyed writing what I did regardless of the grades I ended up getting. 
Julia also led thoughtful class discussions that helped me better understand or analyze readings. She created a great balance between lectures and engaging with us as a class. Every time she had a Powerpoint, a lot of time would be spent in discussing in small groups to interact more with the material so we weren't just staring at slides. Julia was extremely easy to related to and was comfortable cracking jokes and laughing with us, so it was easy to interact with her and at the same time, get amazing quality feedback on all our work. 
FYI: the readings are interesting and sometimes really intense, but she's really good at supplying trigger warnings if you need them (ask her!).

Professor Quenneville-Belair is a nice guy and very intelligent, but be wary, he doesn't pull any punches with this class. The course moves quickly and builds on itself throughout, so you have to stay on top of the material. Everything is taught directly from the textbook though, which certainly helps, and the TAs were great.
My biggest reservation with Professor Quenneville-Belair is his unwillingness to release solutions. He explained that at our level of mathematical sophistication we shouldn't need solutions released for the homeworks because we should be able to identify when we've done something wrong and correct it... Like what? How are we supposed to learn if nobody tells us what we're doing wrong? Granted, this was his first semester teaching this course here, so I'm sure he got plenty of feedback on this point and will hopefully take a different approach in future semesters.
Overall I worked very hard in this course and learned a lot. Not for the faint of heart, but if you're up for it you'll come out the other side knowing a lot about PDEs.
Workload:
10 problem sets (20% of grade), 1 midterm (30%), and a final (50%).
The problem sets were all very time consuming (at least for me) and took up to 15 hours to complete. They were a mixture of applying methods to solve PDEs and writing proofs. The problems can get very long and contain a lot of terms, so you need to be careful about keeping track of everything or you'll get to the end with a solution that doesn't make sense and pages to pour over looking for that pesky π you lost along the way.
The midterm was challenging, but doable if you go in prepared. A lot of people did poorly on the midterm and the professor recommended they drop the class, because the material only gets more challenging and the final is much more difficult than the midterm. I'd recommend over-preparing for the midterm to score points as a buffer for the final later on. The final was close to impossible to finish if you answered each question fully and simplified the answer completely. However, you could score most of the points on each question by answering the hefty portion and leaving a messy unsimplified answer.
The average on both exams was low (62.5 for midterm, 57 for final), but he scaled the average to a B.

I don't know that I would recommend this course, but I certainly wouldn't discourage students from taking it. I think the organization of the class is just more enjoyable for some students than others. It's a different type of classroom experience. I think some students would agree that more planned instruction/discussion would have been appreciated during class time. We always started class with just any comment from the class, but with the vague and open-ended topics regarding walking that were discussed, I think some students just weren't sure where to start sometimes. This meant that the same few people ended up talking most of the time. In any seminar class this is bound to happen, but I think because the discussions were given no direction at the beginning of class it happened even more in this class.
That being said, the workload was extremely light. I almost never did the readings and it didn't really matter. Anytime we turned anything in, Professor Sharpe always said it wasn't for a grade, that it ""was part of the process"" . . . I haven't gotten my grade yet so I don't know what that means.

Gil had an interesting teaching style. He always asked for questions at the beginning of lecture, but didn't always seem to get around to answering them. He just kind of talked about what he had planned and then if something was related to a question, would point that out. I guess he took questions to encourage participation, but I had no motivation to ask a question because I didn't think it would be answered. Pretty much everything he said was interesting, though.
TOO MUCH reading. There weren't many assignments so reading was basically the only thing we had to do, but it was impossible to get through it all. I ended up doing very little of it on a weekly basis and then doing what was necessary for the midterm and final paper.
The only reason I'm hesitant to say I'd recommend is because Gil added an attendance policy after the drop deadline, and students could only miss 2 classes. That was pretty annoying for someone who hadn't been missing very often, but wanted the option when necessary.

Emily was wonderful in class. She encouraged discussion really well and always provided really thoughtful commentary herself. A bit of a tough grader sometimes, but always gave great feedback and I felt like she wanted us to do well rather than just being mean with her grading.

The class is interesting and all the information is presented in an easy to digest manner. Ariel is very interested in creating an open environment in the classroom and is always transparent with students. He brings in real life examples to demonstrate topics, as well as welcomes any questions students may have. I could not recommend this class and professor enough!

Ariel is an incredibly down-to-earth and self-aware professor who really takes the time to get to know his students. He loves feedback to tailor the class to student needs. The class usually starts out with 5-8 minutes spent on an attendance question (really easy questions like what's your favorite place to visit, or a person you would want to work with, etc.). These are light-hearted questions that allow him to get to know students better as well foster a friendly atmosphere inside the classroom.
He has a powerpoint ready for each lecture and really encourages students to ask questions throughout the class as well as foster discussion with classmates. We usually have to read 1-2 articles or watch a short video for each class. However, these readings and videos are super interesting so it doesn't take long at all. 
During some classes, we break off into groups to do small in-class tasks which has relevance to the day's lecture topic. Also, we're assigned groups to work with for our case analysis and end-of-semester presentations. The groups aren't made completely random; he asks students to complete a team role inventory form so groups are balanced in terms of different working styles and group contributions.
Course Topics
a) Introduction to Industrial/Organizational Psychology 
b) The Individual in the Organization 
c) The Group in the Organization 
d) The Organization as a Whole 
Overall, organizational psychology is a very interesting field and I wish I got to major in something like this during college. The topics are very relevant for graduating seniors in terms of  understanding dynamics in the workplace, teamwork, and leadership. Ariel is also super fun and presented the material that made coming to class worth it. Our class was at 6pm 2x week but no one ever fell asleep and remained super engaged (definitely a hallmark of success for an evening class).

Professor Rabinowitz is a very nice professor. However, in class, he is extremely unorganized and he is not the best at explaining concepts. There were many times when he would try to explain a concept again only for the MA students (and handful of undergrads) to stare blankly back at him. 
Furthermore, his homeworks were very confusing. He would constantly have to update the problems because they were not clear. They were also quite challenging and required going to office hours to understand how to solve the problems (even the TAs did not understand sometimes).
Despite these failings, though, Dan really does make an effort. He really cares about the students and holds lots of office hours to help students. During reading week, he held at least three final review sessions, each of which were a few hours long. I think that he doesn't usually teach Data Mining, hence his inexperience. However, if you seek help, Dan will go the extra mile to help you out. 
It's not likely that Dan will teach Data Mining any time soon again, but in case he does, I suggest taking advantage of office hours, since Dan is very helpful then. Also, there is a huge overlap with Statistical Machine Learning in terms of content.

Cunningham is a pretty good professor. His explanations are generally very clear, and he cracks some jokes occasionally. One thing that isn't so hot is how he is so unresponsive to emails and has half an hour office hours right after lecture. Just be sure to look over the slides and ask questions in class - he is very open to questions.
Be sure that you are comfortable with linear algebra, calculus III, probability and statistics (at least Linear Regression Models), and programming in R. Homework 0 is the homework that Cunningham gives to see if you can hack the course or not. It's also a good idea to pick up LaTeX to format your homework - otherwise, you'll have to scan everything to submit on CourseWorks.
Be warned that a good portion of the class comprises of Stats MA students, so you must do significantly better than the average (which is usually pretty high) to get an A. Otherwise, the average is curved to a B+.

Truthfully, the labs themselves were not very hard because they were more qualitative, unlike the General Chemistry labs, which were more quantitative. That being said, everything else was definitely difficult in the sense that it had to all be a certain way, and somehow that certain way changed with every lab report. I started off with A's on my lab reports, but as the semester progressed, I ended up getting lower and lower grades, even though I worked harder towards the end. Honestly,this lab made my life miserable and required almost as much work as you would give an organic chemistry lecture. This lab was the reason I chose not to purse a chemistry major, and at this point I just want this entire Barnard Chemistry experience to be over.

Please do not take this class. I found it extremely hard to focus during class because I simply could not either understand half the stuff she was saying or I was bored out of my mind because she had a very monotonous voice. She does not curve, so your grade will legit be your real grade. The workload is a lot, and sometimes she randomly puts assignments on courseworks and assigns random due dates for them like Saturday night or something which you end up forgetting because that is not the time of the class and you usually associate homework being due at the beginning of class time. I understood absolutely nothing from this  class, and it was very hard to stay awake. so basically you will neither get pleasure nor the grades from being in this class.

Literally the most AMAZING professor ever. She made me fall in love with essay writing, and english as a whole. She was sarcastic, and very straight to the point, but SUCH a sweetheart. She explained exactly what I did wrong, and how I could correct it, and gave me something to go off of, instead of giving the stereotypical answer of ""analyze the text, and really try to see what it means"". I never missed a class, because I enjoyed going to every single one. It was an amazing class, where we would talk about anything and everything for a few moments before getting into the readings. She never, ever mocked any interpretation of the reading, and did not make you feel inadequate at all. She admits to the fact that she may not know everything, and instead wants us to analyze the text together. The workload was definitely manageable, and while I read most of the assigned readings, you could get by in class by just skimming through them and getting the main idea because you always had a chance to analyze them in class.

The lectures were not very clear.  Little to no guidance with regards to outside resources that could be used to help learn the material was given.  I bought both textbooks and used those to teach myself most of the material, but had to spend hours identifying which chapters corresponded to the lectures since no reading guide was given.  The lectures were not correlated with the text in terms of order or heading.  I am sure Professor Liu is a brilliant professor, but he needs to slow down and walk through the steps more clearly.  Frequently he would jump around and then simply ask at the end ""questions?"" to which everyone was so lost that they rarely asked questions.  Having slides that were a bit more comprehensive would be extremely helpful as well.  Maybe it was just my learning style and his teaching style that were not compatible.  I have excelled in most of my Econ classes and maintain a high GPA, but found this class to be overly stressful (due to the lack of guidance) and near impossible to excel in.

It is hard to overstate how awful this class is. Povinelli is a terrible lecturer who while known as being incredibly intelligent, cannot put together a coherent sentence to save her life. This class in general is supposed to be ""easy"" however she makes it impossible. The readings have no connection to the lectures. The TAs were frustrated with both the students' lack of understanding and the professor's lack of communication. The ""mini-terms"" were graded completely subjectively and put together specifically to trick the students. The questions on exams often included information that was not discussed, or certainly not in the detail asked for. The identification section on the mini-terms was even more of a joke. Most of the time google had to be consulted to be able to properly study. However, in the last lecture, she bribed us with pizza.

Hands down, one of my top 3 favorite classes I've taken in college, maybe even my absolute favorite. Professor Bernstein really makes the class into a personal journey for every student, allowing you to take a learning orientation (focusing on what you learn and take away from the class) as opposed to a performance orientation (getting a good grade in the class). Your grade is a reflection of your effort and dedication. Above any other class, I truly felt like what I put into the class, I more than got out of it. You get a group for projects throughout the semester, but this experience was unlike any other I've ever had in a positive way. Groups are made based on individual evaluations that put people who complement each other together, so we were able to work together in the highest capacity I've ever seen in a group dynamic. They were the best group-project experiences I've ever had.
Throughout the course, he encourages you and gives assignments that help you reflect on yourself, your progress, learn about who you are, and what you're strengths and weaknesses are. He holds himself to the same high standards that he holds his students, and keeps everything as fair as possible. Rather than rely on only course evaluations at the end of the semester to improve himself and the class, he takes the time to give students the opportunity to anonymously give him feedback and constructive criticism. This way, the every facet of the class improves while you're there (instead of just benefitting the next semester's class) and becomes tailored to what's best for the students. If you can get into this class, take it. I learned so much about myself-- things that I'll take with me, wherever I go, for the rest of my life. Best thing I could've done senior year.
Also he's probably one of the hottest professors I've ever had. Definitely payed attention because I liked the course material, but I gotta say it didn't hurt that he's easy on the eyes. (Sorry ladies, he's married!)

After reading the reviews below, I was super nervous about going into Bernstein's class, and almost decided not to take it.
I am so glad I didn't listen to the comments below. I don't know what happened in that class, but my experience with Bernstein has been anything but monstrous or horrid. This class was amazing, and there hasn't been anything offered before that's remotely like it, and I sincerely hope they offer it again. Not only is Bernstein downright brilliant, she put together an amazing syllabus and facilitated amazing discussions. She managed to break down texts which were often more theoretical and dense than most sociology classes might assign, and explained them clearly and simply. She's also incredibly sweet, responsive to emails, helpful outside of class, and it was clear that she was just as invested in the class and the material we were studying as we were.
I absolutely loved every bit of this class. It completely changed the way I think about sociology as a discipline, and the type of work that sociologists can do. You will want to work hard for this class, not just because Bernstein has high expectations, but because the readings are all absolutely amazing.

Am surprised to see that Lilla no longer has gold nugget, since he really hasn't changed and probably won't barring unexpected head injuries. I'd like to focus on the seminars so people who didn't take LitHum with him can get an idea of whether it's useful. Or skip the reviews and read this article for his thoughts on liberal education:
http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/college_week/2005/11/college_makeover_8.html
--
If you're concerned about grades and workload (perfectly understandable), you might want to rethink taking his LitHum section.   I think that if you're humble and you put in the work into writing your posts (most important part, easiest way to tell if you've done the reading) and participate in discussion, you'll be fine.  He is easily one of the best LitHum teachers, and most importantly, he actually really enjoys teaching the class and listening to his students (no, really).  Yes, he does tend to guide the class onto certain interpretations, but generally speaking this is much more useful and more interesting than chaotic speculation (never mind the fact that he knows the books better than any student).  Broader discussions of themes happen frequently, but only as results of conflicts within the texts themselves.  That said, if you have a good grasp of the text or an alternative interpretation, you should definitely be able to contest or augment his own picture, so please do that and don't bitch about the class being an echo chamber.  I actually get the feeling he would like it if people were more combative (at least that means you're invested).
--
Seminars: they are glorified reading groups.  Lilla will select a single main text for the semester (in some instances supplementing it with other readings), which the class will read at a slow pace.  The class is divided into halves, which alternate between writing long posts (1000+) and shorter responses (500+) every week.  Depending on how good the posts are, Lilla will organize the class around them (inserting topics or passages that he feels are important).  Classes go like this: he gives a little intro sometimes, then jumps directly to a passage, which becomes the basis for discussion until time demands that the class move onto another passage, and another topic.  On rare occasions, he will lecture a bit when a certain idea comes up (negative theology, for example) or if the class is just lost.  Discussion is usually very good at comparing different readings and different angles on the texts; Lilla will also bring up other thinkers and books, which I've always found useful (if merely tangential). 
---
Lilla has the knack for transforming everyone's comments, both good and bad, into useful observations for the rest of the class.  I have found that the quality of other students (and my own, of course) mattered very little to how much I get out of it, since Lilla seems to make it all intelligible.  This is especially impressive because his class attracts such a random bunch (people from across the humanities, and a couple outside), who are used to approaching problems in their own fashion.  Of course, it also helps that he doesn't take undercooked bullshit - if he doesn't understand you, he will ask you to clarify, and he's really not into patronizing moralists who proselytize instead of analyzing (very rare though).  Lilla takes the discussion pretty seriously, and it's not uncommon for him to take notes and learn from students (it's also pretty invigorating to feel like you're being taken seriously, and I haven't gotten that from any other professor).
I will say that some people have told me they weren't a fan of the way he approached texts (whatever they meant), and some have said they appreciated other teachers for allowing them more leeway for personal exploration.  I either disagree or do not understand these criticisms (see article), but, they're there... 
--
In the past, Lilla's done classes on Montaigne, Rousseau, and Pascal - but he will do different texts in the future.  It's really probably your best opportunity to spend a lot of time trying to understand the text, and I would recommend it for that reason alone.  What really makes Lilla's classes great for me isn't really the discussion or his insight, but the fact that by the time I've turned in my final papers, I will feel like I've come to know these books very intimately, and it would be dishonest to deny that each of time my interests and thinking have shifted.  After you take his class, there's just no way you can read philosophy any other way, and no other class will come close to giving you a similar kind of experience.  It's because of this that I would take a Lilla class no matter what he taught.
--
Finally, I want to put in a good word for the man himself: capital fellow, un bonne homme cause he likes French.  He loves teaching and his students, and people across the spectrum of interests and beliefs like his classes (lots of repeat offenders).  He also has a great sense of humor - or am I the only one who's noticed he has/had portraits of (I think) Napoleon and Burke in his office? 
Intellectually, he is a fantastic resource - he's good on basically any period of Western intellectual history, but he's best on early modern and 20th century Europe, and he's especially good on Christian theology and also on politics.  I have yet to receive a bad book recommendation from him.
TLDR: No, fuck you, I put time into this.  Damn, it's actually pretty long.

Workload:
Always a lot of work.  To be fair, he puts in just as much work (people seem to miss this fact).  If you're a senior taking his class in the Spring, then you'll have less time to finish your longer paper.  Seems pretty dicey to me.  He would give feedback on my writing, but I only got it when I was a sophomore (in other words, when I needed it).  Either I really am the shit, or he likes me too much to tell me I suck.  Not that concerned, honestly.

Prof Mowshowitz is one of THOSE professors who teaches and tests in a style all her own. I am NOT a premed major nor do I want to be. She lectures, teaches and then tests on materials foreign to most. In a class where the MEAN test grade is a 70 this is evident. My classmates and I spent 15 plus hours a week on this class to score a 70. That says a. She doesn't teach right or b. she doesn't test right. Avoid her at all costs.

Take this class! Honestly, this was the best class I've ever taken at Columbia. Professor Cruz truly organizes the class in a way that allows you to learn more about your learning style. He showed that he genuinely cared about the well-being and personal growth of each and every student in the class. If you keep up with the assignments, there is no reason why you can't do well. He is a generous grader, so grades shouldn't be an issue if you put in the work. If you do take this class though, I recommend not coming in with the mindset of just getting a good grade. You'll get so much more out of the experience if you come in genuinely wanting to learn, instead of just being focused on how many points you have. 
I was truly blown away at the end of the course. He gave a heartfelt speech that really tied together everything we learned. I never thought I would ever take a course that would make me cry for a reason that wasn't related to grades, but Professor Cruz proved me wrong. 
My only regret is not going to his office hours to get to know him more as a person.

Professor Vaz is the kind of professor that makes college worthwhile. 
I sincerely believe that one would be hard-pressed to find a reviewer who'd say anything negative about him, unless they never showed up to class and in turn didn't do particularly well.
I quite literally wrote down verbatim some of the things he said to us in class, they were THAT meaningful to me. I'm not a history major, but I had to take the survey class as a pre-req, and it's what inspired me to take America Since 1945. Going to class was truly a pleasure, I found myself angry when I had to miss it for whatever reason. 
As a lecturer, Vaz is dynamic and charismatic. He has notes to look at, but he rarely refers to them. He has a seemingly endless amount of knowledge about Supreme Court cases, which may sound dry but I assure you, it's not at all. He could probably teach a history class structured around some of the most pivotal cases. This is knowledge I used in other classes, papers, and even in conversation. His lectures on American history covered abortion and housing discrimination in ways I never knew about. During the very last class of the semester, he commented on the Black Lives Matter movement. 
Outside of the classroom, Professor Vaz is incredibly approachable and supportive. Without any real incentive or necessity, he read and commented on my senior thesis. Because his classes are rather large, it's easy to go a semester without ever really engaging with him one-on-one - DO NOT LET THIS HAPPEN. It is so valuable to talk with him, whether or not you actually have something to go over. He's cool and incredibly wise.
If you are reading this review and considering whether or not to take his class, drop everything and take it. The only reason you shouldn't is if it conflicts with a mandatory course...so plan to take a class with him next semester. I've had a lot of professors while at BC/CC, and he ranks as one of the absolute best.
Workload:
There are 3 or so essays, each with associated reading. You can't get away with not doing ANY of the reading, because it's necessary for the papers, but I'd mentally separate class v. coursework.

This class is is a little obscure, but that being said I also feel it really does represent what a first year seminar should be. It is extremely interdisciplinary, with different aspects of the class falling under the purviews of environmental science and policy, sociology, psychology, women's studies, and education.  The one area this class really doesn't fall (and probably should) is English.  I didn't choose Exploring the Poles, I was placed in it after not getting any of my other FYS choices, and I'm so glad I was.

Be wary of Professor Lilla's grades. They are not charming nor they are sometimes fair.HOWEVER PAY ATTENTION TO WHAT HE SAYS BECAUSE ITS VALUABLE BEYOND THE CLASS, ITS VALUABLE FOR LIFE. 
Taking Professor Lilla's fall LitHum section was certainly challenging and rewarding. His class is dynamic, open and he encourages free discussion (as long as you are willing to defend your position). Of course, just as any Professor in LitHum he will guide the discussion towards areas he finds more interesting, but if you are able to make the case for something else, and defend it against his comments, you will see the class steering your way. This class is not for those who do not like to argue, for anything you say he will challenge. Don't take it personally because he wants for you to improve and that's the value of this class. Not only is his extensive knowledge of the works and Western Civilization impressive and engaging, but he knows about life, and pay attention to what he says because you'll learn more about yourself, than about Achilles or any Greek hero in Professor Lilla's class. 
Do not expect fantastic grades. They are not easy to get, although they're not impossible. In terms of feedback, just know that he is not there to mess around so be ready to get feedback during the class, and only after your long paper assignments. 
I absolutely recommend this class (and professor) to anyone who came to college to not only get a diploma, but learn and grow as an individual. You will enjoy the discussions and learn about history, philosophy, literature and much more. Don't hesitate when taking his class, but be careful because it won't be easy and you might shed a tear or two.

I learned how to properly revise and articulate myself on a sentence-by-sentence basis. The handouts were extremely helpful, and I won't ever throw them away. I have applied skills learned in this class throughout other classes already throughout this semester.
The course is extremely beneficial in its selected readings, and how to evaluate what is necessary in a research essay and what isn't in terms of the radical revising tactics. This course is extremely strong in that you build strong connections with your teacher as you are in a class with around 13 other individuals. The teacher brought in outside sources that we had read as actual voices in the classroom, which was strongly advantageous-- ie Susan Rosenberg came into our class and discussed her book, An American Radical, openly and honestly.
Ms. Schwerin gave me the most feedback I've received in college thus far. She was always available to meet outside of class about difficult concepts or on paper ideas and extremely accessible through email. This was my favorite class this semester. She generated lots of class discussion about random topics as well as connections through other sections of the course. Her timeliness of even the longest assignments was efficient. What you get out of this course entirely depends on the work that you put in outside of class. Her selected readings were always pleasant.

Moody-Adams is an ethical boss.  Her understanding of the material and her personal insights into it--especially during the last third of the course--are amazing.  She has done a tremendous amount of thinking--and writing--in philosophical ethics, and always gives well thought out arguments for and against the claims made in each reading.  She has also developed some really compelling views of her own that seem to capture important aspects of what ethical inquiry what is really about.  These views are creative and new, yet draw on what feels to be the actual way in which people think about their moral lives, and the class has the privilege of reading a few excerpts from her work in the last week.  I'm a philosophy major and gained a lot from her class; anyone who puts thought into their interactions with the world has much to learn from MMA.
I'm really happy I took ethics with her.  That said, her lecture style can be frustrating.  First of all, she uses powerpoint, which in my opinion is always boring.  Her lecture style can be engaging--she certainly does not just read from the slides--but the medium makes the class boring at times and sometimes hurts the logical flow of the class.  Secondly, she is often very tired, and it shows.  She can be a little disorganized and some of her lectures were not so clear as a result.
Outside of her lecturing--which, to be clear, is sometimes great, often just OK--she is always on point.  She loves when students ask questions (though she never prompts them) and she consistently gives thoughtful and interesting answers.  She's great to talk to outside of class and clearly cares to talk to her students despite how busy she is.
Oh, man, the readings for this course are amazing.  We read the big three of normative ethics--John Stuart Mill, Kant, and Aristotle--and then contemporary philosophers in each of their ethical schools.  We then did a week on feminism and the ethics of care (super interesting), one week on egoism, and three weeks on metaethics (which addresses questions of objectivity in ethics and the nature of ethical inquiry).  It was all great.  There's not to much of it and not too much work either.  It was a really great class.

She also grades really fairly, no surprises, and what I like best about her is she simply is a really nice person who is very approachable for students. Her reading assignments are also very light, which makes sense since many Columbia students don't do those due to the length.

This course is not for the feint of heart, but nevertheless it is a masterpiece that slowly unfolds. 
Seth Schwartz is one of the most brilliant, if not the most brilliant professor I have had at Columbia. His breadth of knowledge is astounding - in history, Classics, religion, and many other related fields. 
In this course, we studied the history of the Jewish people during the 3rd-7th century Roman Empire and surrounding areas. This class was a seminar and therefore involved lengthy discussions on the reading in several thematic topics, including the rise of the synagogue, the Jewish Himyarite Kingdom in Arabia, and the Augustinian doctrine. We payed very close attention to rather esoteric primary sources, which I would never had heard of had I not taken this course. 
Overall, this course was eyeopening and helped me get a sense of the changing relationship between the Jews and the early Christian state structure in Late Antiquity.
Workload:
Very intense. There is always a short primary source to read each week along with around 50-100 pages of secondary reading. Additionally, each week there is a 1000-word essay about the week's topic. Finally, there is a 25-page research paper.

Kasara is one of the worst professors I have had at this University. Her lecture slides are more helpful than actually listening to her, but unfortunately she posts them to courseworks weeks after the material has been introduced, sometimes mere days before an exam. She is disorganized, and you can tell she relies on her TA's to do most of her teaching for her. The lectures are too hard to follow, and her slides are chock full of the tiniest, faintest text. She is an extremely knowledgeable woman but she is simply not a good professor. And then she has the nerve to get offended when we don't show up to class. I'm upset I bought books for this class, it wasn't worth the money. Most things get summarized on the slides anyway. You can learn a lot from them, but there's no indication of which material will appear on the exam. There is just so much information to sift through that you won't even be tested on it's ridiculous. Also, like 2/3 TA's were unusually hard graders, so they were a really fun addition to an overall shitty class.

TOO MUCH WORK. She assigns a ton of reading, weekly discussion sections which are boring, and on top of it there are three exams and a paper.

This is one of those classes that every systems programmer should take, even if they will never design a chip in their life. You will lean so much about what actually goes on in a modern CPU -- much of which is not very well documented by online resources. It's essential for anyone who wants to write fast code -- for example, if you plan to work on operating systems, libraries, or high-frequency trading. 
I learned a lot from the lectures, despite being scheduled Thursday 7 - 9:30 PM when everyone is exhausted. Prof. Sethumadhavan was a great lecturer for the first half of the semester, but then he stopped making jokes (probably because he was tired like the rest of us - but jokes help us stay awake). There are definitely some lectures that were extremely dry even though they could've been interesting. Also, his explanations are unclear (self-contradictory) sometimes on complex things, like how to access a DIMM.
The most helpful part of the course was taking with Prof. Sethumadhavan during halftime and at the end of class. He is really great at explaining stuff in small groups and genuinely takes pleasure in hearing interesting questions from students. Wish I had attended office hours more.
The problems from the book truly horrifying - they are filled with ambiguities and errors - but my understanding is that there are not that many textbooks about computer architecture. Maybe there are some non-textbooks that we could integrate into the course. 
However, I really enjoyed the group homeworks where we had to argue about how to interpret computer architecture papers and write programs to demonstrate concepts from class. The midterm was in the same vein - come up with some optimizations and then implement them - so I also enjoyed it a lot.
Sometimes the assignments were poorly worded or had bugs. For example, the hw3 skeleton code did not properly check whether the optimization changed the program's output, despite several corrections by the TAs over two weeks. This did not affect our group because we figured it out, but had we not been so careful, we could've wasted a lot of time and had nothing to show for it. I understand that TAs are busy, but correctness is also important.

Prof. Kale is a nice guy, but as a first-time professor, he is not very good at lecturing. His explanations of the conceptual stuff is very clear, but when it comes to the derivations and proofs, I don't think anyone in the class really understood what was going on. Which sucks, because the exams are all about math. His strategy for explaining math seems to be to click through the slides as quickly as possible. 
The good part is that Prof. Kale takes student feedback _extremely_ seriously, so after the midterm he included more math questions on the homework so that we could have some preparation. (Some would argue that he takes feedback seriously to a fault, in that there are too many extensions)
As much as I am complaining, this course did a good job of introducing me to a wide variety of machine learning techniques which is exactly what an introductory course should do. It demystified machine learning, by showing that most of the algorithms are intuitive and simple.

Homework assignments are erratic, assigned irregularly and ranging from a couple of questions to upwards of ten with lettered subdivisions. The lab section is equally sporadic. Since both depend on how much material Professor Sun covers in lecture, much is postponed during the first half of the semester and work piles up after the midterm.

I highly recommend this class to anyone who is interested in philosophy or ethics in any capacity. Professor Moody-Adams is a wonderful human being and a great teacher. She lectures off of slides that she puts on Courseworks so a lot of people don't go to class, and this is a huge mistake. The slides don't contain everything she wants to say and often times she explains things in ways that the slides do not capture or she discusses something that isn't on them at all.
The class covers some of the more classic ethical theories (util., Kant, Aristotle) and then moves on to some other topics (Ethics of Care, Egoism, Meta-ethics). It's a great introduction to some of the major topics in ethics (both new and old), and also a great introduction into philosophical thinking.
Professor Moody-Adams is really nice so go to her office hours and ask questions. In general the grading is very fair and the workload pretty light. If you go to the TA's before the papers you will not have a hard time writing them.

You would be very lucky to have Kevin Elliott as a CC instructor. I've heard about a lot of bad experiences with CC teachers, and I was so thankful to have Professor Elliott. If you're looking for a joke CC class where you don't have to read the books, then this is not it. His class is taught the way CC classes should be taught. You have to read the books and pay attention in class but you will gain a lot from it. He makes the works incredible accessible and explains them in ways that will clarify all the questions you had when you were reading Marx or Hobbes that you thought were blatant contradictions or totally vague.
He hands out reading questions for each thinker which are extremely helpful in terms of guiding you through your reading and helping you understand some of the focal points of each writer's thought. His class is mostly lecture, but he lets it evolve into discussion when people have things to say. When people disagree he may also try to encourage the debate or ask people for suggestions. Most people find CC classes with lectures very boring, but you will learn A TON if you pay attention in his class. He knows all the works well, unlike what I've heard about many CC teachers unfortunately. Even though the course is a serious one, he's kind of a funny guy and the feel is very laid back.

Nevertheless, the material and method of analysis are rigorous and interesting, and maybe you'll come to really care about some of the more theoretical, abstract topics (like, maybe the world should have a coherent description of identity or the possibility of backward time travel).
Grading is not bad and the workload is very light. If you've been to class you'll be able to do the take home assignments. Going to class is highly recommended. He covers everything in the reading in class and will test specifically about things he talked most about in lecture.

To my knowledge this was the first time the class was ever offered, and certainly Prof. Roberts' first time teaching it as this is his first year out of graduate school. Alex is an incredibly engaging and thoughtful lecturer. He has a deep knowledge of the course material, can speak multiple languages, and has bursting enthusiasm for the subject. Lectures were a good mix of dates/places/names and encouraging students to think critically about what they had read so that they could evaluate different historical narratives. In office hours, Prof. Roberts is very kind, makes an effort to get to know you, offers you chocolate covered coffee beans, and above all offers tons of help on your papers or understanding the course material. Frankly, it's surprising this is only his second semester teaching. I've never seen someone lecture with such comfort and enthusiasm. Prof. Roberts commands the classroom with ease.  
This class is not very difficult, though it may seem like a lot of work. Exams and papers weren't difficult. 
Strongly recommend this class for anyone looking for an interesting global core, curious about what happens after Rome, or looking for a history of the Christian church.

The lectures were not clear.  Little to no guidance with regards to outside resources that could be used to help learn the material was given.  I bought both textbooks and used those to teach myself almost all of the material, but had to spend hours identifying which chapters corresponded to the lectures since no reading guide was given.  The lectures were not correlated with the text in terms of order or heading.  I am sure Professor Liu is a brilliant professor, but he needs to slow down and walk through the steps more clearly.  Frequently he would jump around and then simply ask at the end ""questions?"" to which everyone was so lost that they rarely asked questions.  Having slides that were more comprehensive would be extremely helpful as well.  Maybe it was just my learning style and his teaching style that were not compatible.  I have excelled in most of my Econ classes, but found this class to be overly stressful (due to the lack of guidance) and relatively unrewarding.  He should have covered less material, but made sure students actually understood what the heck was going on in class.
If you are a mathematician that can grasp abstract concepts easily, then you will excel.  If you work hard to get your grades by taking advantage of recitations and outside resources, this is NOT the class for you.

1.) LECTURES
Professor Davidson is probably the best professor I have had at Columbia (and I am pretty picky when it comes to professors).  She genuinely cares about her students.  She is also alright with not covering as much material in class in order to leave ample time for questions and make sure that she thoroughly answers those questions.  CAUTION: IF YOU DO NOT ATTEND CLASS, YOU WILL NOT DO WELL.  She does not have Powerpoint slides.  Everything is done on the board.  That being said, SHE IS A FANTASTIC TEACHER.  She has taught this class for a while and has developed an organized way of presenting the material while making sure students truly understand step-by-step how to do a problem.  She won't just write a formula on the board and expect you to understand it.  She will explain conceptually why that formula makes sense, then go through a concrete example of how that formula is used.
2.) HOMEWORKS
These are not terrible.  They take about 4-6 hours each.  They are very doable though given that she literally does examples that are the same as the homework in class to give you a solid foundation.  The TAs are very helpful in their recitation and are willing to help too.
3.) MIDTERM/FINAL
These are extremely straightforward.  She does not try and trick you.  If you understand the homeworks/readings in and out, you can 100% get an A in the class.  Her office hours are amazing too.  She will go through any concepts you are struggling with very clearly on the board in her office.  She is also super friendly and approachable =).

Mary Gordon is an egomaniac. She speaks well, with specificity and keen observation, but so clearly delights in the sound of her own voice that the effect of it is rather ruined. She picks favorites and cold calls them in class by first name. ""Georgia -- why don't you play with this?"" She'll ask of some student who has clearly been to office hours, if not over for dinner.
Her taste in literature is as depressing as it is totally dreary. I think she might've ruined literature for me, actually, just a little bit -- or at least in the middle of the semester it felt that books, like life, were for enduring and not for enjoying. But that'll happen when you read novella after novella about women with no hope for their futures. 
In class she said that girls should not dress to be desired when they go out partying, and that if they do so they should at least not be surprised when they are assaulted or catcalled, prompting one student to storm out of the room. (It seems her brand of feminism is as outdated as her taste in books; society has recognized lengthy/flowery description as dull just as it has recognized slut-shaming as wrong.)
 She used the n-word in class trying to make a convoluted point about cat-calling, and apologized for it the next week, before sharing an unrelated anecdote about her ""good friend"" Claudia Rankine. Congratulations, Mary! You know a black woman! This is a specific gripe, but it's part of a broader issue: she pretends to engage the class in debates, but doesn't care about listening as much as she cares about being right. She'd rather refute her students than speak to them.

Nina was terrific. She was so sweet and clearly cared about each and every one of us. I could tell she was kind of nervous for the first few weeks, but as the class became more comfortable with each other, she also became more comfortable with us. Her teaching style took some time getting used to because she would deflect a lot of questions back to the class, as well as try really hard to engage us early in the morning, but I liked it overall. She was very good about making handouts for every class, as well as keeping detailed notes on CourseWorks assignments and in PowerPoint lectures for each class. She also made herself very accessible in terms of office hours and assignment feedback. She was great about turning back assignments promptly and held us accountable for our work.

Joe is witty, self-deprecating, and absolutely brilliant. His humor and dedicated passion to the texts makes class enjoyable, even if his expectations are sometimes alarmingly high. Joe dominates the discussions in class, not only because he has a deep understanding of the texts and their histories (he is an archaeologist, a Ph.D. candidate for Classics, a Fulbright Scholar, as well as is fluent in Greek and Latin) but because he is so smart that he often intimidates the rest of the class into silence. That being said, he cares about each of his students deeply and is always willing to meet with us outside of class for hours on end to discuss the readings and our writing assignments. Joe also makes an effort to help us understand and appreciate the texts in an extracurricular context, through taking us to museum exhibits, film screenings, plays, or to a restaurant just to get to know his students better.

Shamus was a witty, enthusiastic, well-prepared, and brilliant lecturer. He introduced many theories and ideas that broadened my outlook on the world and made me excited to continue taking classes in the social sciences. My biggest qualm with his teaching style, however, is his lecture pace. He spoke very quickly, and used zero visual aids, so it was incredibly hard to take satisfactory notes. I think that he should have either a) maintained his quick pace but also used a visual aid such as lecture slides, or b) slow down. The only way to take comprehensive notes (which were necessary because we were quizzed on the lectures) was to use a laptop. I hate taking notes on a laptop- it's distracting to both me and the people around me, but I wasn't able to keep up. I missed a lot of the names that were mentioned, and I constantly worried that I was missing major points.  Otherwise, Khan was a great professor to experience because he is making strides in the field of sociology and clearly has a passion for sharing his experiences and perspectives.

Acting the Song is perfect for singers/actors who are looking to expand their repertoire. I highly do not recommend this course to acting or singing novices-- it requires you to get up in front of the entire class and perform a solo song with an accompanist. You must learn the song on your own, so music reading ability is highly recommended. Wendy is an interesting teacher– she cares deeply about each of her students and does not prioritize anyone despite discrepancies in talent or commitment to the class. Wendy not only exposed me to a wide variety of musical theater that I have never experienced, but she helped me develop my belting voice which I have been struggling to unleash for the past few years. Her song selection is sometimes questionable, and she has zero regard for time-- she could spend 45-60 minutes on one student if permitted to. That being said, she also teaches at Juilliard, therefore is very knowledgeable about the performing arts world. She clearly wants her Columbia/Barnard students to succeed, even if we are not her conservatory students.

ANNIE RUDD IS A GODDESS AMONG MORTALS
She will (regrettably. so, so regrettably) not be coming back to teach next year, but I felt that it was still necessary to tell the world how much I love and appreciate Annie as a professor. 
In my experience, Annie has only given back positive feedback. As long as you write something coherent and hit the word count, she will give you at least an A-. She says 30% of the grade is participation, but I have spoken maybe 5 times and never had a problem. I think she just really understands that CC shouldn't be about showing off how much of the reading you did but about really getting each student to engage with the subject, understand it, and (dare I say) enjoy it.

Professor Sacks is incredible. She is patient, intelligent, fair, engaging, knowledgeable, and generally wonderful. She has high expectations and doesn't tolerate students who do not put time into the course, but she is also extremely understanding. She is super encouraging.

She values learning for the sake of learning and will always be understanding if you have extra questions.

The first issue is that the assignemnts are not given back on time. The professor takes weeks, and even months, to correct written assignments, preventing effective feedback. She is also not available when students ask to review their assignments and tests with her. 
Second, the Professor mostly caries out her class in English, rather than in Arabic -even when she is not speaking about grammar, which could be explainable for that case only. This is a major issue, as the course, which fosses on Litteral Arabic, is already not focusing on speaking. 
Third, the Professor skipper 6 classes this semester, for which she did not organize any make up class, and did not give more than a one hour notice when she was absent.

I understand why some people have complaints Lalith's teaching style because sure, he can be condescending, but if you learn to laugh it off you'll recognize how much he's actually taught you. 
The only real frustrating thing was the lack of communication between professor, TA, and grader. At times they would contradict each other, or simply seem to not know what was going on in the lecture/recitation & problem sets. Also, and much more subjectively, his manner of flippantly writing people off when they don't get his definitions correct to the letter seemed to disincentive many students from participating; this was especially ironic when he himself would give different definitions from the ones I carefully memorized in order to avoid public humiliation (I say this lightly, at least he's funny...). Obviously, this still made the point of how essential the definitions were; perhaps it could just be done in a less dramatic manner. 
He knows the material inside and out, and he explains everything with a clarity that I haven't found elsewhere in Columbia or Barnard Economics courses. He makes his courses challenging, and because he does not curve the class (he uses a weighting system), you know that your input into the course directly impacts the grade you receive. He makes sure to go over anything that people don't understand, and his (often biting) wit kept us engaged even when the topics were dreadful. The PSets were annoying at first but the grader was chill and the TA goes over every problem the next week in recitation. I was completely surprised to have enjoyed Microeconomics; his real-world examples and tangents about his research made it clear why this stuff is actually worth studying.

Birol Emir absolutely should not be a professor. After four years of undergraduate classes and one year of graduate school, I can say with confidence that he is the most incompetent professor I have ever had. This is not hyperbole. He fails to be an effective instructor in every way imaginable:
- Lecturing: Birol Emir does not know how to teach the material. His Powerpoint slide decks were literally just images of blocks of text copied and pasted from our textbook. Or sometimes, the slides would be taken directly from a company presentation with no alteration whatsoever. (He works at Pfizer. Slides would have the Pfizer logo in the bottom corner.) It was obvious that he did not prepare for the lecture in advance; he would go to a next slide, take a second to read the block of text, then summarize it ineffectively, or just read part of it out loud. Sometimes he would walk through an R program; but instead of doing a full demo, which would have been very helpful, he would just point to different R functions in the program and say completely unhelpful statements like, ""this function does this, and that's good because we want it to do this... check out the manual on this library for more information."" He would not go into any depth on any particular item or topic. Instead he would just mention something, and then move onto the next topic. I would leave every class feeling like I didn't actually learn anything. Instead, I would write down a list of the topics that he mentioned, and then attempt to learn the material on my own via the textbook or some other online resource. For example: He rushed through hierarchical clustering in about 10 minutes, literally skipping multiple slides at a time without mentioning any of the material that was on them. When he did stop occasionally on a slide, he didn't actually explain anything; he just read the slide. I'm honestly not sure he fully understood the material. After class, I went on Youtube and watched a series of lectures about hierarchical clustering, which was 100% more helpful than what Birol had prepared.
- Class management: I have never seen a class that was as disengaged as this class. The 20%ish of enrolled students who did not drop the class after the first two sessions would sit in class on their laptops, not paying any attention. He would occasionally ask a question to the class, and the same two students throughout the whole semester would attempt to answer the question. (If they were not in the class, I'm not sure what would have happened.) The only times where I felt like I learned anything was when a student would push him on a topic and ask a great question, and he would be forced to try and answer the question. However, he didn't even do this effectively all the time, and sometimes the questions appeared to annoy him and he would cut off the person asking the question and give a very terse response. 
- Assigning work: He assigned homework very irregularly. There were no assignments in the entire second half of the class. The time it would take to do each one was completely variable. This was only the case because he didn't plan them out with any thought, instead just selecting a couple of problems from a textbook chapter. On one occasion, one of the problems required a third party data set that we did not have access to. When students brought this to his attention, he was surprised. The midterm was a disaster. He did not have a set date for when he wanted to hold the midterm exam; students would ask him almost every single class when he would hold the midterm, and he didn't set a date until a week before the designated university midterm week. Instead, he scheduled a take home midterm for two weeks after spring break. And the final exam... the instructions were just incomprehensible gibberish. I literally had no idea what he was asking us to do. He clearly spent about 5 minutes putting it together and failed to proofread anything, because it is fraught with incomplete sentences, duplicated text, etc. (For example, one of the Questions was not actually a question. It was just a bunch of half-baked statements in some bullet points. Unreal.)  
- Class scheduling: He ended every single other class 5 to 30 minutes early. (30 minutes early!!! Holy crap!) He wastes time in each class stumbling through his laptop trying to find files. He attempts to do class demonstrations in R but then fails to do them because he can't find the right file. Over the course of the semester, he didn't come in to four classes - one absence was due to a sudden family emergency, which is a totally legitimate reason to miss one session. But he missed the next session as well for the same reason, when he had ample time to form a contingency plan (e.g., have the TA teach the class). Another time, he couldn't get into NYC from his home in Connecticut because of the weather. He attempted to hold a video conference class lecture, but it was totally ruined by technical issues, so it was essentially useless. Inexcusable.
The material itself is interesting and potentially such an important topic to understand (big data, analytics, etc etc), and I am genuinely upset that I wasted credits, tuition dollars, and time on this course.

Workload:
I mean, I guess kind of light. But I spent more time trying to decode his gibberish instructions on the assignments/exams than actually learning/doing the work, so don't view ""light"" as a positive aspect of the class. God this class was absolutely miserable.

A disappointing class.  Overall, he's pretty tough despite the easy-going air with which he carries himself.  So be forewarned about the following: he says from the start that the course is ""self-contained"".  This means that all you need is offered during lecture and via his courseworks notes.  That's certainly true if you have the ability to follow his speedy presentation and his bottom-line calculations that omit the steps taken to arrive at his conclusions.  Record the lectures and go over the slides later.  Also, speaking of math, be ready for proofs during HW and exams (although how you're supposed to know and learn how to write them is beyond me).  The math involved at times pretty ugly Algebra, Calc I, and partial derivatives and the Lagrange multiplier from Calc III.  
Although there is a syllabus, it's pointless, since he does not release any notes ahead of time.  There are two recommended texts but again, good luck reading ahead since he doesn't tell you what chapters to read until the relevant lecture - so you'll be playing catch-up the entire semester.
Another small grievance is that his slides and problem sets are full of typos and errors; a frustrating lack of attention to detail.  
The TA's were the usual mixed bag - try to find the PhD students and stick with them.

I couldn't imagine a more straight forward class. Or a more clear professor.
Friedman adheres to Chekhov's Gun Principle in all his lectures. He'll mention some tidbit at the beginning; you won't understand it. An hour will pass. You will have scribbled five pages of notes that seem to have no connection from one line to the next. Then with five minutes left, he fires Chekhov's gun, weaves the lecture right back to the tidbit he dropped in the first five minutes. And your newly-connected synapses will high five each other. You will realize pure math is beautiful.
The best part of this course was stepping into deeper levels of abstraction week to week. Take quotient groups for example. You start with (Z/nZ) in an isolated case; you learn some rules for (Z/nZ), learn some proofs, and think that's it. Then three weeks later you learn about cosets and quotient groups and realize (Z/nZ) is just one instance of a quotient group. Sure, he could teach about general quotient groups then give Z/nZ as an example. But it's so much cooler to step back from your one example and have all the theorems make sense a month later. Chekhov's gun, people. 
He types up a great sheet of notes so about half the class skips lecture. Don't do this. He won the Van Doren teaching award for a reason; spending three hours per week in his class is worth it.
I devoted every Sunday to the problem sets. The entire Sunday. Then I'd take any questions I had to the TA help room Monday morning; the TA from Taiwan is really great, though I can't remember his name. The problem sets are graded pretty harshly; expect points of unless you're perfect, another reason to go to office hours.

I am an alum from a short while ago who is pursuing a medical career, fortunately with some success (at least thus far). 
This class can be beneficial to you as a pre-med in several different ways:
1) Doing well in the course demands that you adjust to complex material and a new mode of problem-solving. 
2) It requires you to produce. Regardless of the time you put in and the effort that you pour into studying, if it doesn't show up on your exam performance, your grade will suffer. This naturally causes some stress, but it parallels aspects of MCAT preparation, of interview season in the thick of med school applications. You have to adapt your processes on the fly and work smarter, not just more, as with some other class. You can't work mindlessly, on autopilot. The correspondence between work/time and results can be unclear to many and it requires some troubleshooting to establish. 3) It is difficult, as I expect medical school, which I will begin shortly, to be.
Regarding preparation for the MCAT--it is not that the class functions necessarily as the ultimate MCAT prep course, as I have heard some to say (at least in my experience it doesn't). Rather, the fact is that the demands of the class make you more accustomed to ""pressure"" MCAT study/reasoning places on your shoulders. It is like running a marathon--you'll be better off if you're accustomed to the exertion.
Now, that said, it is easy to get overwhelmed if 1) you're background in biology/chemistry is weak (this may be due to your own negligence in earlier years of study, or, as it commonly is, due to matters out of your hands). 2) You have a lot on you're plate in terms of competing demands on your time. 3) You have bad time management skills. If you have any of these problems, you need to do some introspection + pursue tutoring etc. Get some outside perspective/help.

Professor Vaz is one of the best lecturers I've had at Columbia. He creates a coherent narrative through out the semester, situating his material both in the larger context of American political history and in current events. He presents central themes which he develops each class and then structures the final around. I came away with a much deeper and more nuanced understanding of race relations in America after this class, and would recommend it to anyone of any major. Professor Vaz is all around great - very funny and personable - which makes going to lectures all the better. 
Workload:
Very manageable - really interesting readings (journal articles + 4 books) which will be very relevant and useful for the final 
2 essays (25% each): 5-8 pages, gives you much liberty about what you want to write about, one is grounding a current even in a larger historical narrative and the other is a comparative essay (ie US race relations v. another country)
Attendance/participation (25%) there is no discussion section, so you just have to show up to lecture and participate in discussion about the readings (gives designated time to do this)
Final (25%) - 4 short essays (take home) on themes from the class that he hints at mid semester; very straightforward - if you've been keeping up with the reading and going to class, these will be easy and also will leave you with a very good grasp on the material

After a full semester attending most of the lectures and all of the discussion sections, I've concluded that this course organizationally makes absolutely no sense. The books themselves, however, are for the most part really entertaining and well worth reading.
Professor Gamber stated in no uncertain terms in the first two lectures, ""if you don't believe white privilege exists, this is not the course for you,"" which I would think would self-select a group of pretty ""social justice""-minded students (myself among them). However, Professor Gamber spends the rest of the semester lecturing to this imaginary student he made it explicitly clear from the beginning he didn't want in the class. The result is lectures full of entry-level social justice statements (""If you believe in equality between all genders, congratulations, you're a feminist.""), which are usually redundant, kind of patronizing, and (as others have noted) often tangential to the actual book. Another reviewer wrote that Professor Gamber has a tendency to speak on behalf marginalized groups he is not a part of, which I would say is accurate. It can get pretty uncomfortable as a student of color in lecture, ironically.
Because Professor Gamber's lectures focus largely on critical theory and historical phenomena surrounding the book, discussion about the actual novels gets relegated to a 50 minute discussion section. I really liked my TA, but 50 minutes per novel wasn't nearly enough time to really delve into the books. Your TA really makes or breaks this course, because they hold the discussion sections, and they do all the grading — what was actually really frustrating was that Professor Gamber withheld information on the midterm and final formats (even from the TAs) until the last class before each. (Ultimately, both exams were pretty easy). Professor Gamber didn't even show up for the final exam, which I found pretty telling.
In general, I'd say Novels of Immigration is worth taking if you're really interested in the novels, because it's not at all a difficult course, and Professor Gamber's lectures, while pretty lackluster, aren't the real backbone of the course. I don't feel like it should count for Global Core, but apparently it does, so this seems like a fairly viable option. If you're in CSER or the English department, however, you'll likely find the course pretty bizarre and struggle to grasp what exactly you're meant to take away from it.
As for Professor Gamber specifically, if you have similar politics to him (you hate the Core's Eurocentrism, you want to destroy the white supremacist cisheteropatriarchy), you might enjoy a seminar-style class with him, wherein you can actually engage with the books and his arguments about them.

Workload:
11 novels (about one a week), all from contemporary American authors.
It seems like the assignments for this class change dramatically from semester to semester, but here's what it was this time:

I should begin this review by saying that Arvind is clearly a brilliant researcher and very hard working man.
However, I think there is a baseline level of organization and preparedness which is missing from Professor Narayanaswamy's class. The files and lecture slides he posts are very disorganized - they often repeat things, have material that was never covered in lectures or homework, and have file naming conventions that are very confusing. It makes it a struggle to even teach yourself the material after you're not able to follow the lectures.
Arvind clearly knows the material by heart, and is very excited about it, and even makes a sincere attempt to teach you the real-world applications. That's nice and all, but alltogether the lectures are often unclear on what you'll actually need to take away or write down.
The homeworks appear to be written by Arvind himself, which is a nice gesture, but it ends up causing a nightmare of corrections on problems that do not provide complete information or state what assumptions need to be made. On multiple occasions, corrections were made on the day before (once even the day) the assignment was due. You might learn to put it off until later in the week, like I did.
The tests are very similar to the homework. I didn't think they were terribly unfair, but they were still sometimes unclear and many problems did not provide pictures or diagrams to make clear what was going on. Some of them are very math-heavy, but others have been purely conceptual. The averages are very low and the standard deviations very high.
You probably won't have much choice in what Professor you have for this course, but you might consider trying to make an extra effort to keep your notes organized for this class, because by the end of each topic (and especially by the end of the semester) you will have a huge mess of scattered material, and only the homeworks will make clear what you actually need to take away.

I came into this class having taken a basic programming course in high school.  It wasn't completely a breeze, but very doable and I came through with an A.  With such a basic CS course, there is a lot of information out there if you get lost, and you should utilize it.  The book is very useful, office hours are a big help, there are many resources online, and other students can be helpful with the homeworks if you don't know where to start.  Blaer is a great professor - entertaining, funny, and makes things very clear even when they're difficult concepts to grasp.  Having taken 1004 and 3134 with him, I'm sad to not have him as a professor next semester.
Make sure that you read the book and get help early if you think you might need it - the concepts you'll learn build on each other so it's important to not get lost or it will take a while to get back on track (same with all CS courses, IMO).  If you're new to CS, expect a struggle in the beginning since the most basic concepts are covered pretty quickly, but it will get easier for sure.

Professor Manser was a great professor! She was great at explaining the material in depth and making sure that everyone understood the subject. While the classes were a little monotonous with having powerpoints most of the time, it was never boring at all--the class always went by really quickly despite that. Professor Manser also did a good job of getting everyone engaged with group presentations, class discussions, and personal presentations. She was always open to what students had to say, either in class or in office hours and was genuinely interested. The material is really interesting to anyone who is curious about why humans are the way they are. This class was the first one I took in EEEB/EBHS and now I am going to concentrate in it!

The previous reviews are all on point, but, having finished my second semester with Mrs. Kun, I had to add to her high praise. I cannot speak highly enough about her dedication to her students and their success. If you are contemplating the long, hard road that learning the Russian language can be, I strongly recommend that you, at the very least, start your journey with her. She will go to great lengths, assisting you through any struggles and making learning aids, to help you with your studies. She is also very understanding when you get behind in your studies because of other course workloads. Mrs. Kun is competent and delightful, but will challenge you to assess your progress.

Professor Halpern-Leistner is a very enthusiastic and knowledgeable lecturer, you can easily see how much he enjoys the subject matter, but his class was very demanding. Week to week, the WebAssign homework, for me, averaged about 2-3 hours to complete. The written homework was more difficult. On average, I spent 5-6 hours working through the written homework problems.The third homework assignment took me 15 hours to complete (combined), but, after realizing how long it took for everyone else, he adjusted the difficulty. If you do not dedicate the time to master the subject material in his class, you will, more likely than not, struggle on the quizzes and exams. I am an Economics major, and as much as I enjoy learning calculus, this course may be better suited for math majors. Professor HL was very active on Piazza, answering questions and clarifying subjects, but he prefers to ""push"" students to figure things out on their own, as opposed to just clarifying a lack of understanding. I cannot attest to his office hours, but given his enthusiasm, I assume he was more than eager to aid students.

An absolutely incredible professor, and the other reviews are correct - one of the smartest people you'll ever meet. Class was mostly discussion-based with occasional mini-lectures. She does a great job bringing out the significance of each text in context, without forcing tenuous modern-day connections. Because her main field is political science, discussions about the political implications of the texts were always pretty interesting. Although CC has its drawbacks, she makes it a worthwhile class.
There are four essays throughout the year (two per semester). For each one, you hand in a first draft (worth 5% of your final class grade), she gives it back with extensive comments, and then you hand in a final draft (worth 15-20% of your final grade). Her feedback is very helpful in refining your argument for the second draft, and it's definitely a great way to improve your writing skills.

This class was a lot dumber than I thought it was going to be. Professor Hall has decided to use a few experimental teaching methods that pretty much just don't work. She has one student lead the class every week by discussing another students' paper, except nobody ever reads the other person's paper (because..why?) and it ends up being the professor, the person presenting, and the person who wrote the paper chatting for an hour. It's pretty pointless, and you won't learn very much.

Sayantani is a fantastic professor, and this is a fantastic course. It focuses on the politics/ethics of representation and how narratives of all kinds impact health (not just physical but also emotional, mental, social health). The course began with some broad issues of representation and moved on to covering things like constructs of disability and masculinity, borders, organ donation, structural violence, mass incarceration, ""global health,"" and education itself. Theoretical readings or ethnographies (never long) were usually paired with either a graphic novel, documentary, or film. 
Sayantani is so friendly, kind, and open to student ideas. She obviously cares about the class and the students in it, and she is brilliant. She is also great at maintaining a balance between some moments of lecturing or direction and open class discussion.Plus she is willing to provide you with advice on projects outside of class. One of the few professors who I felt genuinely cared about every student in the class.
It's an interdisciplinary course (sometimes taught in CSER, sometimes in Comp Lit but also counts for human rights and the graduate narrative medicine program) which means students bring a lot of different perspectives and interests. 
Strongly recommend taking the course. It actually changed the way I experience and analyze narratives.

Jervis has been doing this for 40 years - he's not going to change and no one is going to try to change him. This is academia at its finest: he may be a brilliant academic and expert on international politics, but he is a terrible professor. 
I took this class optimistically, knowing how famous Jervis is in his field and not afraid of a heavy reading load. I attended each class (along with approximately 40 other students in a class of 270), and struggled to sit through every single one. Jervis sits at a table for each lecture and proceeds to talk/ramble for the 75 minutes. Even if you are passionately interested in the topic, the lack of organization and his many real life examples make it nearly impossible to follow. When he writes on the chalkboard it is literally illegible. Though Jervis does hold office hours and occasionally asks questions, he is a poor communicator and did not seem genuinely interested in interacting with students. 
My TA was fantastic, but ultimately, the lectures and the discussion sections don't matter: your grade boils down to 3 quizzes on hundreds of pages of reading and 4 take-home essays. Even though the topics felt interesting and meaningful, the readings were mostly dry and the lectures drier. 
This is not a learning environment I would ever choose to be in. Considering how much money we are paying to go this school and the limited time we have here as students, DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I never felt intellectually stimulated or supported.

What to say about Jeremy Dauber? From the moment we started class, I fell in love with Yiddish literature and Dauber's teaching methodology. I never had any exposure to Yiddish literature prior to this class, and I was one of two undergraduates in a graduate level class. I read prior reviews of Jeremy Dauber prior to taking him for this seminar, and while I cannot speak to his other classes, I believe that Dauber is best in a small setting like a seminar. To the class itself, it was EXTREMELY small with 6 total students (4 graduate, 2 undergraduate) and I believe this allowed for all parties to shine. I was able to ask (and highly encouraged) to ask questions and really dig into the material. Furthermore, while I myself felt inadequate to speak on literature devices and very technical aspects of the author and works, I was not made to feel inadequate or that my opinion did not matter. In fact, the graduate students, as well as Dauber, made me feel extremely welcome to voice any questions or opinions that I had in the text, even if it was not necessarily aligned with the majority of the class. Overall, I felt that the earlier reviews do not paint an accurate picture of Jeremy Dauber, the classes he teaches, or his attitude and analysis of the works that are studied. If I was not graduating this year, I would definitely take another class with Jeremy Dauber. If you put the effort in, you will be rewarded and it will be worth it. 
TL/DR: Jeremy Dauber is amazing. Take his class.

Workload was typically a work every week. With each work studied we had to write ~1 page response which would guide the discussion. Undergrads had to write a 6-8 page midterm paper, and the final project could have been a traditional paper, or in the case of this particular class, a digital lab option that had us doing various projects for Sholem Aleichem's website, such as a timeline and a map. The class treats you like a big boy/girl and if you do not keep up with the reading it will show, particularly in a class of 6 people. Put the time into doing the work and you will be fine.

Worse than anything I have experienced in my four years at Columbia. 
Students to Putnam are like taxes to ordinary people: highly annoying but must be dealt with. She is utterly incapable of delivering a coherent, let alone interesting lecture, and is downright rude in her comments. To this day I don't know if she is just socially awkward or nasty, but whatever it is, her approach to other human beings is unacceptable. 
I was coming into this thinking that while the reviews are negative, the subject matter is interesting enough to cover for it. Boy was I wrong. The material is only mildly interesting and her teaching methods are just painful. A typical class would be an unorganized Putnam delivering a messy lecture, followed by blank stares of those of us still awake. 
Her inability to publish anything useful on the matter should have perhaps informed the poli sci department to hire someone else, but unfortunately, they believed she is the best candidate. Go figure.

Jokes aside, this class is a lot of work. It's also potentially dangerous. Like you could die if you're not careful. Perhaps the only other class where this is possible is PE scuba. Look up ""industrial lathe accidents"". Anyways...
I took the class pass/fail during an experimental phase, so I don't know what direction Prof. Vukelic plans on taking it in (I'm not even sure you'll get to choose whether or not to take this class). I do, however, know that it will likely still involve machining 4 parts, writing G-code (machine assembly language), attending lectures and taking a few brief 10-minute quizzes.
The parts take time to machine accurately, probably averaging 8+ hours each. Also, you're going to constantly be asking the lab-tech for help-- if they're not around, you're stuck.

Professor Yannakakis is a very capable lecturer. Although he has a soft voice and a slight accent, his explanations are very clear and so are his answers to questions. It's not a super exciting class, but at least you won't be confused. 
His problem sets are also reasonable and do not contain anything he hasn't taught.

Professor Gravano is an excellent lecturer. His lectures are very clear, and he does a good job of answering questions. He is also very friendly and helpful during office hours and maintains an active presence on Piazza.
The only thing I didn't really enjoy was that he recycled some of the old databases lecture slides, which are sometimes unclear (his own lectures are much more helpful). Definitely show up to class, since the textbook, while helpful, contains more than you need to know and the slides are not very helpful on their own. Also, he offers homework and project grace late days which, while helpful, were not always allowed to be used on certain homework and project parts, which kind of defeats the purpose in some way.
Despite my nitpicking, Gravano is still a great professor!
Workload:
Problem Sets (15%) - Not too difficult, although be sure not to make silly errors, since most of the class does well on the problem sets.
Midterm (25%) - The first question requires you to define database terms in at most two sentences - the rest of the exam are free response questions asking you to write relational algebra expressions, write a query, etc.
Final (40%) - Like the midterm, but slightly longer.
Projects (20%, 15% for project 1 and 5% for project 2) - The first one is the longer one and each part is spread out over a couple of months. Definitely start early and pick a good partner, or you will suffer. The second one is much more manageable.

All of the reviews of Becher are spot-on. She's funny, casually brilliant, and able to take really dense material and make it understandable. I was dreading taking social theory because it's tons of dense reading, but Becher made it manageable and was clearly enthusiastic about teaching the material. She's the kind of professor who wants you do to well, and with whom you will want to do well. She's also one of the few professors who was able to take a class of more than 30 students and have q-and-a sessions that were productive.
Some of the small group work we had to do was tedious and annoying, but you get through it. Every assignment she gives, even if there are a lot of them, has a reason behind it. She has a very clear idea behind how to teach social theory and she conveys that really clearly.
Workload:

Tian Zheng is a wonderful professor. She really made this class one of my favorite at Columbia through her humor and teaching style.
Applied Data Science is entirely project-based. The course grade is based on five projects - a group of four or five people (randomly chosen) works on each project (except for the last project - you can pick your own partners). 
Professor Zheng had a great vision for the course, from exploratory analysis of US Census data from Kaggle, to image recognition between cats and dogs. Even though the projects seemed very daunting (especially since most of the students in the course are statistics MA students), Zheng was very helpful and provided useful tutorials and offered valuable guidance on Piazza. It was very clear that she wanted her students to learn and grow, yet she provided enough autonomy for the students to work independently (without lecturing all the time). She even provided snacks in class and got class stickers!
On another note, I was initially intimidated by the requirements of the course and how I could stack up against statistics MA students. However, Tian Zheng created a very supportive environment for all of the students and ensured that everyone could use his/her strength to contribute in some way. Because of her, I felt that I learned a lot and made a lot of friends.
I highly recommend this class and Professor Tian Zheng. The next logical step for statistics majors is to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems, and that course offers exactly that. It will be challenging, but you'll have a nice GitHub portfolio at the very end of it!

Workload:
Five projects - each weighed equally. They vary in difficulty - the first one was the easiest while the third one (image recognition) was the hardest, while the students could choose what to do for the fifth one. 
Make sure to start early and to communicate with your group members. Zheng does require groups to mention whether everyone contributed equally to the project or not.

Professor Aloff is not an English professor, and her seminar class proves that. She's a dance critic, and I'm sure she's great in the dance department, but she should not be teaching this class. I chose the class because it seemed very interesting, and, in fact, the readings were terrific and the writing assignments were (mostly) great ideas. But Professor Aloff does not know how to write, give feedback on writing, or anything of the sort. Her grading is ridiculous (i.e., if you don't use the exact word or phrasing she wants you to use in one paragraph out of five pages, she'll give you a B- and then rewrite it for you, you'll hand in the new draft (which she wrote) and get an A+).

The reviews don't lie. I took this class because I thought the material sounded interesting - he is extremely tough. In class discussion if he doesn't agree with you , he will shut you down immediately - or just ignore you and ask if anyone else has any comments. 
BUT he is a pretty brilliant lecturer... that is, if you can keep up with his extremely fast way of speaking and jumping from topic to topic. On the days he had power points, note taking and keeping up with his him was a lot easier...but be sure to pre-download them to your computer because he will fly through each slide. 
He does ask for opinions on how to make the class better... i think he is trying. But he is a tough tough professor...and sometimes NOT in a good way. 
If you are up for the challenge take this class - the actually subject is very interesting, but be ready for a challenge...he's unnecessarily tough.  
The TA was absolutely fantastic, very helpful and graded the papers/finals! he was very helpful!
Also Kato does encourage you to come to office hours and send him drafts of your papers. He is very very helpful in office hours and same when you send him emails. His class is do-able.

Even after considering the awfulness of most Columbia professors, I cannot understate how miserable my experience with Metzger was. He is, at best a tedious and monotonic lecturer. He rarely stops to ask for or answer questions. He puts minimal work into the class - this was his first time teaching, and yet he could not take it on himself to make a practice final or midterm, instead giving us one from another professor that he himself admitted to being bad during office hours. I have had other professors in the same position who were willing to do so, but apparently this is too much for him. 
I didn't have any background in physics prior to taking this course, so I found it challenging. Lectures were not good vehicles for learning the content as he would go through long derivations and spend minutes on a concept. I don't know if homework really helped to reinforce the ideas or not; in my opinion, everyone used available answer keys (go find them) to do the homework. A lot of the HW problems involved useless long math calculations (that he admits he will not test) - honestly, half of the time, it seemed like he flipped to the page and randomly choose a few questions. 
He is also not a gentle grader, in my opinion. 1 midterm, and 1 final made up most of your grade, so good luck to you if you messed either one of them up! I did, and ended up with a B-. It's probably my worst grade ever at Columbia. For comparison, I got an A in 1401, which is admittedly easier and probably has less people who dropped down from 1600. I was actually (prior to taking this class), planning on doing a joint major with physics; this will probably not be happening.
I would personally not recommend him for people who care a lot about grades, do not have a good physics background and require a competent lecturer. If, however, you know the material well, and don't require much instruction, you'll be fine.

This was Kavery's first time teaching at Columbia. She comes off as very sweet and approachable, however, she is far from that. She is extremely stern and unreasonable when it comes to grading and gives very little instruction as to what she expects from students. The class is a small seminar and there are no formal graded assignments besides a brief writeup on three documentaries and a final paper. She basically reads from notecards the whole class, giving synopses of the films, and occasionally asks questions. Kavery is a filmmaker herself and has us watch one of her own films (which is absolutely terrible and literally the biggest waste of time). 
Otherwise, the class material and assignments were engaging. Though the workload is minimal, you will be lead on to believe you will receive a good grade, then be completely blindsided when she returns your final paper and you get your final grade. This class requires a lot of participation because it is a small seminar. However, she does not allocate much time for class discussion and even if you participate, she does not take that very much into account for your final grade.
With that said, I would not recommend her as a professor to my dog nor my worst enemy.

Linguistics students, take this course. 
As far as course material goes RLLG gives you a broad introduction to CogLing, and in particular important terminology, readings from the big fish in the field, and how to find underlying CogLing principles in our daily language use. You end up doing a lot of independent research for her papers, going through youtube videos and reading outside articles. Class discussions were lively and there's a lot of freedom built in to her assignments. For longer papers and even for shorter assignments you can write about most anything you want as long as you can frame it in a CogLing way of thinking.

Linguistics people: Take this class, though I can't guarantee you'll like it.
This class is an acquired taste. We had a native speaker of a rare language come in and each student ran two elicitation sessions throughout the semester where each of us found ways to figure out the phonology, grammar, lexicon, etc. of said language. Each of us were also responsible for doing recordings, working in PRAAT, and taking notes on an elicitation.
Maybe you won't like fieldwork. Some didn't. But you're cheating yourself if you don't try it out.

You would be wise to take this class. Professor Ross is very well-acquainted with the material. Lectures are well-organized and follow the textbook. The material is pretty tough, but you are given the tools to learn it. Topics covered are extremely relevant to software engineering today.
Professor Ross is a slightly awkward guy who definitely doesn't play favorites. I'm not sure he particularly likes any students.
One TA was a star. His name was Wangda and his response time on Piazza was incredible. The other TAs were okay. They tended to give away pset answers rather than help.

Reading these CULPA reviews made me skeptical of taking this class at first. But let me tell you, I couldn't be happier that I did. First of all, Professor Lilla treats his students with the respect and expected us to perform at a college level. I'm sure many Freshmen were intimidated by this, but I really think this class was a great introduction to what college courses are like. We engaged with the texts in this course at a much higher level than other LitHum classes. Our classes were basically an open forum for discussion of higher themes and philosophical concepts that made us challenge our beliefs and get outside of our comfort zones. As someone who took AP Literature in high school, I was so sick of spending copious amounts of time analyzing symbolism, metaphors and other basic stylistic tools. In Lilla's class, while we did discuss and break down the writing styles of various authors, the objective was to get to a larger level of understanding about specific cultures and the moral progression of western civilization. I loved this spin on LitHum and appreciated the chance to think at a higher level like this. I also learned so much from my peers in this class and I think we all reached a level of understanding and respect for each other.
So in short - do not be intimidated at first by other reviews or by the first class in which Lilla tells his students that ""this is not a safe space."" Our discussions were well worth the initial discomfort some students felt when being pushed to engage in the conversation. I think everyone in our class progressed as a writer and a thinker which really set us up for what to expect throughout the next 3 years at Columbia.

I expected the class to be a great seminar and unfortunately I had a terrible experience with this professor.  There are other people that seem to have no issues with Professor Adams but I found him to be one of my least favorite English professors at Columbia.  I would strongly recommend against taking his class.  I interacted with the literature and loved the books that we read however Professor Adams seemed to take a particular disliking to my writing style and even though I met with him multiple times to discuss the final paper I received a low grade.  In my opinion Professor Adams can be a reasonable grader if you spew back what he says in class and if you say it in the style that he likes however if your writing style is slightly different from his preference he lowers your grade.  Worse than the grade Professor Adams has made me never want to pick up another Austen book.

unlike many other professors, his only goal is to make sure that you actually learn the material. cramming for these exams is impossible.
he is not afraid to call on random people to answer questions during class, so everyone has to come to class prepared.
at the end of the class, though, you will realize that you really have learned a lot. you dont just become book smart in econ, you become street smart. tbh i got a B in the class and it dragged down my GPA but im not even that mad because i really did learn a lot.

Taking Prof. Rosalind Krauss' class was a privilege, and in its best moments, a joy. If you like 20th century art—especially Cubism, de Stijl, and Russian Constructivism, all of which receive their due time—then you will love this class. Krauss draws on literature, history, linguistics, and semiotics to present arguments about the course of twentieth century art.
It should be noted that the real span of the course is the 1900s to late 1960s, with brief mentions of the Pictures generation and some later Minimalism and Concept art. The textbook, of course, extends well into those decades. (Even if you don't take this course, I would recommend the textbook, which has gorgeous illustrations and engaging prose. Krauss is one of the four authors.) Additionally, in terms of content, there is no real coverage of post-Impressionism, but Cézanne, Gauguin, van Gogh, and Seurat are all mentioned, so you would be wise to read up on them a little before taking this class. Otherwise, a simple willingness to learn—and at times to grapple with Derrida and Foucault—is more than enough.
Krauss' lectures, while engaging and illustrative, were often short—sometimes even just 30 minutes long. I never found them hard to follow, as other reviewers did, but it is frustrating to hear a teacher talk about cutting content because the semester is too short and then end class halfway through each day.
As for my TA, I have only the highest praise. Nick came prepared every day with a PowerPoint and a clear lesson plan. He was easily available outside of class and via email, and he led discussions in a way that was both open and productive, guiding us just the right amount.

Avoid class like plague. 
The professor prefers the students who feign interest in the texts to those who want to engage with them deeply. Even though participation ""doesn't count,"" if you want a good grade, come to class with witty, simple statements about the texts. The students whom the professor showed a clear bias for were using SparkNotes during class. The entire class is structured around a ""gotcha"" system, where Bloom asks basic questions about plot, then scorns wrong answers as if she's sure the student responding hasn't read the text.
The professor does not like intellectually-engaging, complex, (if roughly-formed,) thoughts.  The course is little more than a superficial survey of some of Bloom's favorite authors. The discussion posts are worthless; the majority of posts are filled with students gushing about just how much they loved the text and how cool the authors were, which is the kind of superficial understanding Bloom is looking for. 
The professor cannot distinguish between a high school English course and a college one. She thinks a paper should be ""persuasive,"" but shouldn't ""attempt to prove something.""  That is, she wants students to use overly complex, flowery language to describe the texts in ornate detail, but does not want them to assert strong claims and back those claims up with relevant evidence. 
The quintessential example of a class where you will do well if you digest the professors lies and repeat them back to them. At best, the class teaches students to distinguish between the words ""Modern"" and ""Contemporary."" At worst, it is an absolute mockery to the authors studied.

Professor Doubleday's lecturing style can be dry at times and reading the textbook was a must but in my opinion, he made orgo as painless as possible. I had Campos for orgo I so in comparison, Doubleday's class was more laid-back. He is very clear about what he expects you to know for his exams. The exams are moderately difficult but just make sure you study the practice exams intensively. The exam problems are more difficult than most of the assigned McMurry hw problems so after a while I just stopped doing McMurry and studied the practice exams exclusively. However, I would recommend using McMurry to practice mechanisms as Doubleday seems to draw upon those for his exam questions. To practice syntheses, studying the practice exams was key. The final was the most grueling 3 hours of my life (18 pages long) but if you study the first three midterms and all the practice exams you will make it out relatively unscathed.
He is not very good at inspiring the students so less than 50% of the class showed up toward the end of the semester (personally, I thought it was a refreshing change of pace to not be swarmed by a bunch of overeager pre-meds at lectures and office hours though). He is very responsive on Piazza and he was generous about offering extra office hours before the 3rd midterm and the final. I would take his class if you are the type of student who learns better by reading the textbook and studying on your own. If you're planning on taking orgo, chances are you've already had a good amount of experience in science/pre-med classes at Columbia so Doubleday's class won't be any different. 
Take-away: 
Orgo will be difficult no matter who you take it with but at least Doubleday's class is straightforward.

This was absolutely the worst class I have ever taken. I was drawn to it by the minimal workload of 2 6 page essays, a  weekly blog post, and an oral final. But Do not be fooled! The readings are boring and confusing. They all ramble about the same thing but are inherently different and make no sense. ""The way of dharma is through action and nonfiction. Being and nonbeing""... WTF!?
Moerman sits at the front of the room and says, so what are your thoughts. And expects students to just talk for 2 horus about nothing. He is useless. His essay comments are nonexistent... a question mark here or there and a grade at the end ... one of my papers he said made no sense and didn't even bother grading it.
There is nothing enjoyable about the class, and nothing to be learned. Warning: stay far away.

Although the course is challenging, it is comprehensive and intellectually stimulating. Prof Taylor's organizational skills may be a nightmare and a half, but if you do your part as a student--review your notes, ask questions, and go to office hours, everything comes together. Lean on the TAs (especially Jeremy) because they know that Prof. Taylor is a tornado and that her slides often make little sense.
Again the class is rewarding. I recommend starting to answer study questions at least 2 weeks before the exam that way you have time to go to office hours before the mad dash the day before the exam. Don't bother memorizing anything she teaches the day before an exam. Since you have choices on each test as to which questions you answer, focus on 80% of the material and skip the stuff you learn the week of the test. You don't have to answer it anyway.
With the online quizzes, just commit to sitting in front of a computer randomly clicking for an hour until you get a 10/10. They really help your grade, and they're kind of like a computer game. Don't bother looking for answers in the text ... which by the way was a waste of money!
For entertainment during the 8:40 lectures (which are absolutely mandatory if you want to do well. Write down every last word that woman says, she will expect you to know it, and the slides are not helpful) keep a tally of each time she mentions her ex-husband. It comes to at least 2x per class. 
Again the class really gives you a good handle on the basics of neuroscience. I learned a lot, got a lot out of the course, but also put a lot in. It was a valuable experience!

Professor Roberts is a very young guy who is incredibly passionate about his subject matter. His lectures, though, were a bit disorganized.  To be completely honest, I stopped going to lecture after the 3rd week of class-- I got much more out of the discussion section. Overall, I found that this was my one class this semester that I could put on the back burner (read: ignore), and I still got an A... and I actually still learned a lot! 
The reading load and course load may seem a bit daunting-- but I rarely did the readings, including for discussion section. I typically skimmed the (ridiculously long) texts a few minutes before section and highlighted a few things to bring up (so that I fulfilled the participation req.)
For the tests, I studied the important people/events/locations that Professor Roberts details on a review sheet.  I was nervous going into the midterm, considering I stopped going to class, but ended up getting a 96 on it (and no, that is NOT typical for me, ha..)  I did have to do a bit of Googling/Wikipedia-ing in order to make sure that I wasn't missing anything significant.  I probably spent a few hours the night before cramming for both the midterm and final and ended up killing both of them.
Essays-- same deal as tests.  I did all of my research online, and considering that the essay is so short (4-6 pages), it was pretty easy to develop a paper.  Remember, this is an intro level class! :) 
**TL;DR -- I never went to class or did the readings. I crammed before every test. The questions for the essays are all Google researchable. EASY A.  Still learned a lot!

I took this because (1) I took Professor Marka's ""Physics for Poets"" class and loved/aced it; and (2) I'd heard from friends that it was the easiest class they'd ever taken. THIS CLASS IS NO LONGER EASY (if you don't know Physics and Math).  I think Professor Marka has had to crack down due to all the A's his students were getting, ha. 
First off: Professor Marka is AMAZING. He is hilarious, humble, kind, and so enthusiastic. Everyone adores this guy. AND-- he is THE genius who was recently on the front page of the New York Times for having confirmed Einstein's theory of general relativity by studying gravitational waves in space. He is truly one of the coolest professors at Columbia.
This class is not what it used to be, however.  Apparently (before the alleged crackdown) you could coast in this class. That is no longer the case -- this class, although easy and completely manageable if you put work into it, is not intuitive by any means.  Class attendance is no longer optional if you want to get a decent grade.  Much of what is discussed in class (guest speakers, etc.) is not Google-able and will be asked on the exam. 
Do the homework (answers are ALL Google-able, but they sometimes take a while to find) and write a decent term paper -- these are the only easy A's in this course.  For the final exams, make sure you GO TO RECITATION.  The team goes over what will be covered on the exam and will show you how to do the equations. The exams are still a bit tricky, though.  Thankfully, I took this course with a group of 6 friends, and if any of us missed class, we would fill each other in on what was covered. 
**TL; DR -- Professor Marka is the coolest, nicest professor ever, but this class is NO LONGER easy (if you don't know Physics and Math) and takes a lot of work.  Do really well on the homework and term papers (only easy A's in this course), and study/go to recitation for the exams.

Six homework sets (all answers are Google-able, but it takes a while to find some of the answers); 3 midterms (he drops the lowest grade); 1 final; 1 term paper.  Thankfully you're allowed ""cheat sheets"" for all midterms and for the final.

Cognitive Psychology with Professor New was fine - honestly, typical for a 1000 level Barnard psychology course. Although I attended all but two classes during the semester, most of my studying came from the textbook. Since he's pretty incoherent as a lecturer, the only way to understand how the material fits together is to read the textbook (you don't need to memorize the chapters though!). If you have questions, it's best to ask in office hours because he gets a bit snippy during class when people raise their hand. Although the exams are poorly worded and require a decent amount of studying, it is completely possible to do well.
On a more positive note, Professor New provides a ""fair game"" sheet about a week in advance of each exam, which includes all of the relevant terms. Again, you should read the sections in the textbook to get a full picture of the concept, but the ""fair game"" sheets are definitely sufficient (in other words, you don't need to memorize everything in the book or on the powerpoints). 
tl;dr Cognitive isn't a particularly good class and Professor New is honestly pretty annoying as a person), but a fine way to fulfill the Group A requirement.

Developmental Psychology with Professor Senghas was decent class, but nothing great...standard for Barnard Psych 1000 levels. Although I found the material for the first half of the class to be a bit dry, the sections on academic achievement, temperament, attachment, and gender development were super interesting and Professor Senghas supplemented those sections with great readings (it might be helpful to note that I was particularly interested in those topics though before taking the class though...)! Professor Senghas is clearly very interested in the material and has a lot of anecdotes to illustrate the concepts on the slides. I definitely think the course is worthwhile if you're trying to fulfill the science requirement or you're a psych major, but I wouldn't necessarily take it as a ""fun"" elective. 
In terms of the exams, it's important to do the reading. She says it's the difference between an ""A"" and a ""B"" in the course. I'm not sure that's true - I didn't do all of the reading during the semester and I got an ""A,"" but I definitely looked through the chapters pretty thoroughly when studying for the exams.

Professor Sussan is THE BEST!!!!!! She was apparently a high school teacher before coming to Barnard, so she really knows how to explain concepts so that everyone understands. She walks you thoroughly the different sections of a psych paper step-by-step, helps each group with their final project, responds to questions over email, and honestly tells you what to write in each report. Overall, she's a really great professor/person to be around! 
As psych labs go at Barnard, I think this was a particularly good experience. I can't say that I learned much about stats or research design, but it was completely do-able and (as I said before) Professor Sussan is awesome.

I can't say enough good things about Professor Rojas!!! I think after teaching the course for so many years, he has it down to a science (no pun intended). He posts an assignment on courseworks each day (so five per week) and holds office hours every single day. The assignments are never due, but if you keep up with them you're good to go for the exams. During the second half of the semester I generally did the assignments every weekend or every other weekend rather than after each class, but it still worked out well. Because Professor Rojas is such a good lecturer that I never felt lost or like I had to teach the concepts to myself, which seems to be pretty rare for intro science classes. I simply showed up to class, did the assignments as much as possible, and learned organic chemistry! I never felt like I was blindly memorizing things or teaching myself from a textbook.
A tip for the last part of the semester - you should keep a running list of new reactions that you learn and organize them by product. Then, memorize the mechanism and the reagents. Having a consistent study group throughout the semester is also helpful! 
Apart from that, Professor Rojas is a really funny guy overall. He reads poetry during class and seems to have a good sense of the pulse of the class (and Barnard in general). If you have to take organic chemistry, you should hands down take it with Rojas.

He didn't give really any grades back until the very end of the semester, so no one had any idea how well they were doing in the class. His teaching was confusing and when the class didn't understand, he didn't take the time to make it more clear. The class was a disaster.

She was so caring about her students and truly wanted to see everyone succeed. The class was heavily discussion based, which in my opinion is how LitHum is meant to be. She is so sweet, gives ample feedback on assignments, and responds to emails in a timely manner. She will give you an extension if you need it.

Professor Gertzog was awesome!!!! He is SO knowledgeable about the course material and his passion for it shines through in his lectures. He's a very sweet man that loves teaching. I never went to his office hours, but I wish I would've. He's really old, so if you sit at the back it may be hard to hear him at times, but I didn't have this problem because I always sat near the front. Also, at the beginning of class he usually does a recap of the previous lecture and sometimes he will go off on a bit of a tangent and it takes him a while to get back into the structured lecture he had planned. It didn't bother me though.
There are 3 take home exams which are each worth 1/3 of the grade. They consist of two essay questions and he usually assigned them on monday and they were due wednesday, so you had 48 hours to complete them. The questions were tough, and he expected you to incorporate the reading into your responses, which were capped at about 1100 words per question. Also, the grading was pretty tough, but altogether fair. Plus, he lets you appeal the grade if you feel it's really unfair. It's difficult to get an A, but if you work hard on the essays and incorporate the readings/lectures you'll do okay. I got an 85 on my 1st exam and a 95 on my 2nd. (Haven't got the 3rd back yet)

I absolutely hated this class. Not that I didn't find the material somewhat interesting, I did. But Albert was awful. He has a background in quantum mechanics, so if you don't know much about physics, a lot of stuff in his lectures won't make sense. Also, he's just not great at explaining things clearly to a group of undergrads. The lectures are not great. He presents a single problem, asks the class for possible responses, tears their answers apart, and eventually moves on without providing an answer at all. Each problem would take about 4 classes to get through. This got boring and frustrating. I realize that the problems he presents don't have perfect answers, but it would have been nice to at least look at what modern philosophers have to say about them. There were 3 essays. He only counted 2 of them for the final grade. The grading was VERY arbitrary with the TAs grading some, Albert grading some, there was no consistency. Also, he let you write about anything from the course, which was sort of annoying because he pretty much had already demolished all of the class' ideas on the subjects in class.

Getting along Lalith requires more efforts than with other Econ professors. His exams are fairly written and his homework is nothing crazy, but the lectures are sometimes rather insulting in the sense that he expected certain answers from his students and if you recalled something quite different from his expectations, he would interrupt you instantly and directed the question to another student and so forth. The course content is straightforward and if you do well in the final, your grades may get bumped up (I did a little above average during the midterm, and got a few checks instead of check-pluses for problem sets, but my final grade is satisfactory). The latter half of the course has more topics with applications, such as job market signaling, time preference theory, and some preliminary game theory model, which are more interesting than the first half with consumer and demand theory. Having said though, understanding the first half is indeed, as the Professor claimed, crucial for understanding further topics. The course in overall is well designed and my TA Effie is extremely helpful. She compensated for the fact that Lalith is not very interested in things like office hours per se. Yeah -- he's intelligent, but pretentious in some ways. Be prepared for that and you will be fine.

I've never felt compelled for write a review for a professor but when I come across someone this inspiring and impactful, I feel that it is the least I can do. I had Roosevelt Montas for my second semester of CC. He is the director of the core curriculum, a master in American studies, and a strong defender of the value of a liberal education. He is extremely personable, kind, knowledgable, passionate and fashionable.  He teaches you engage with the readings in a way that changes the way you think about life, and forces you to constantly self-examine, remain critical, skeptical and open to the new. 
Participation is incredibly important to him- it constitutes a significant portion of your final grade. He wants to see that you are not only doing the readings but engaging with them, finding holes in them, and putting them into conversation with each other. If you prefer a strong, seminar, discussion-based environment, you should most definitely take his class.
You get as much out of this class as you want. While there are so many readings on the syllabus and it is absolutely impossible to discuss them all in depth (as Roosevelt knows and regrets), I strongly recommend that you do as much of the readings as you can- it will be reflected in your grade and it will profoundly impact your life and the conversations you have outside of class. I wish I could have had Roosevelt for the entire year, but I am incredibly grateful of everything I have taken away from his class.

Professor Shen is the best calc Professor I've had thus far. I have taken two other calc classes before this and struggled both times. Unlike other professors, Shen is very straight forward; he does not try to trick you. His lectures are straight from the textbook, almost completely verbatim. If you can learn from just reading the textbook you definitely do not need to go to class. (He says so himself.)  He gets the questions for the midterms and final from the textbook! Some of the questions on the exams were even previously assigned for homework; it is literally that easy to study. When he had in class review before a test, I am pretty sure he is holding the test in his hand as he writes on the board exactly what we should study. Before the final, he wrote down specific examples from every chapter he insisted we should know how to solve. Some of those examples were on the final. I know that if I didn’t do so well on an exam, it is completely on me for not studying or practicing enough questions from the textbook. He can not make the exam simpler. The other calc 4 class that was occurring at the same time as this one with a different professor had an average on the first midterm of 50% while this class had an average of 75% - 15 out of 20 total points. The only con with his tests is that each questions is only worth about 3 points so losing a point here and there for a silly mistake actually does impact your grade. 
Additionally, he is a very nice person; very sympathetic! He stops his lectures to see if anyone has questions. You can ask as many questions as you need and he will patiently answer them. I know some students who freaked out before exams and emailed him for help and he always responded with reassuring words. I even know some students who asked to take the midterm a different day, either because they were actually sick or because they felt they would fail if they took it then, and he allowed it! Professor Shen even allows you to do an extra credit presentation. It is so rare to find a professor who will actually give extra credit. It’s clear that he does not want to fail you. 
He does have a bit of an accent but to me it was no problem. Just beware that he pronounces some words funny. (i.e what sounds like “de-man” is actually “domain” or “try-ple” is “triple”)
In all, definitely take Professor Shen’s class if you can, it is the most straight forward class you will find. There is a pretty good curve but I would say your grade mostly reflects the amount of work you put in, it’s that simple.

I was so scared off by the mixed CULPA reviews at first that I tried avoiding Lax, but my schedule eventually forced me into taking his class, and it's become one of my favorite classes at Columbia. We focused mostly on the Supreme Court, and it was really interesting to learn about all the theories on how justices and other factors can interact with each other to shape opinions and outcomes. Lax is a very engaging lecturer (I know some professors can be annoying with their tangents, but I always found his stories about the personal lives of the Supreme Court justices and the SCOTUS gossip pretty entertaining), and he's well-aware of his faults as a lecturer (talks too fast, HORRENDOUS handwriting, a bit disorganized), but he's more than willing to go over things that the class didn't understand if you ask him to. For the most part, the content was easy enough to understand and remember, but things do get a bit complicated when he brings in diagrams and graphs to explain voting patterns, so maybe that's why people have more negative recollections of Logic of Collective Choice. Not sure how he is one-on-one, seeing as how I never managed to schedule office hours with him, but overall, he seemed like a pretty friendly and approachable guy.

Schulz is clearly passionate about teaching Korean, and I think she truly cares about her students' well-being. There are certainly improvements she could make to the way she teaches; the main one is that she has a tendency to make her students keep guessing until they get the right answer if they have the wrong answer the first time, which I don't think is a very effective method - if I get it wrong the first time, and don't have the correct answer within the next two tries or so, it's clear that I don't remember the grammar rule that you want me to remember. She's not particularly good at explaining grammar rules either, if you don't already have an understanding of Korean that goes beyond class-time, but she's certainly willing to go over them again and again with you after class. Overall, it was a bit of a struggle to adapt to her teaching style in the first semester, but I think by the second semester, everyone started to understand how she worked, and things got better. Like the previous review said, she's a very sweet old lady for the most part, so just don't get on her bad side, and show her that you're really dedicated to learning Korean.

Professor Bernstein is great! He does a nice job of balancing between lectures and discussions. He is not only receptive to feedback but genuinely encourages it on a regular basis, using the continue-start-stop notecards. He tries to make the learning material as relevant as possible to graduating seniors, and so you leave the classroom feeling like you've learned more about yourself and how you work with others. He is a really fair instructor in that he provides detailed feedback on assignments and provides sufficient time for completing assignments. Overall, he seems to care a lot about his students!

This class is definitely not an easy economics elective. Unless you're really passionate about international macro (and a lot of the subject material is really interesting), you probably should not take this class. 
The only ""textbook"" is the manuscript for the one she is currently writing and it is filled with typos and mistakes. Homework and exam problems range from moderate to impossible. And the only way to practice for exams is to do the problems and there are NO SOLUTIONS. 
After the second midterm, we learned three pretty difficult models. NONE of them showed up on the final. It was so incredibly unfair that we slaved away at memorizing those models for the final and the entire final was just stuff before the second midterm.

A really great class. You will learn so much about the New Deal and World War II. This class covers many of the economic, social, and political developments during this time period (roughly 1932-1948).

Vallancourt is one of the worst professors ever. I don´t know why people keep saying he is amazing. He is not amazing at all. All he does in class is talk about his cat, his life, or his past jobs. I think I only missed about 1 class, and the next class I didnt even know what he was talking about. It gets absurdly annoying that he doesnt use the book, so you cant really catch up because he doesnt even post notes online either. This is a very ineffective way of teaching. It makes me resent going to class. The quizzes were much harded than homework or class material. You usually find questions in the quizzes about material that was not taught during class. Do not take this course with Vallancourt if you easily dose off at a boring professor, because HE IS BORING. He can make jokes once in a while, but not everyone understands the jokes. Its not meant for everyone. Most of the time you would find about 5 people sleeping. Considering this class was at 4pm is a big concern. People shouldnt be dozing off at 4pm. I really did not enjoy my time during this class, and the labs are long and require much effort. They ran during the night, so you would be exhausted just getting there.

I would not recommend this professor or course. A brief summary of two takeaways:
1. The course is artificially difficult exacting rote memorization of content delivered verbally rather than quantitative skills or abstract thought.
2. Timely feedback was not provided, grading seemed arbitrary and contradicted the syllabus.
Sethumadhavan is knowledgable and encourages discussion during class. He waits for students to think through the examples he gives, entertains follow up questions and does not rush through the material. The midterm was challenging and a good opportunity to apply cache optimization techniques to a benchmark of scientific software. 
Sethumadhavan verbally delivered the majority of the content for the course. During this time he drew hundreds of rectangles on the blackboard to illustrate the interaction of different computer hardware components. This often seemed frivolous and distracting. Lectures were sometimes obfuscated by sloppy or incomplete handwriting. Slides might help to organize and deliver important concepts clearly and concisely. 
Grading seemed arbitrary and feedback was delivered late, if at all. No comments were provided on the implementation section of the midterm and the grade was returned the day before the final. After the course finished in May, the homework was decreased by 10% of the total grade and the midterm was increased by 10% of the total grade contradicting what was stated on the syllabus and on Canvas throughout the semester. 
CS is a broad field. Some courses may be challenging due to inherently abstract or mathematical content. This is not the case with computer architecture. If you study computer systems or are an aspiring computer architect you may enjoy certain aspects of the class; others may feel that the difficulty is contrived and the course lacks substance.

Shirkey is a great lecturer - he's genuinely pretty funny, he conveys the material in an interesting and lively manner, and his explanations of the content are clear and concise. I took comprehensive notes and found that almost all the time the material we were asked to discuss in exams or on essays was covered thoroughly in lecture. It's worth coming to class for that reason alone. He also interacts with the class somewhat regularly and given that this class seems to attract a lot of veterans, students who don't have that background can gain a lot from listening to the discussions he has with vets about their experiences and how they relate to the course material. 
For students interested in security studies and strategy, I would recommend taking this course with the forewarning that the syllabus is not that organized. The class deals with, among other topics, the theoretical basis of strategy, military doctrine, civil-military relations, state-building, the relationship between economic development and war, arms races, the revolution in military affairs, air power, alliances, military intervention, civil wars, future wars, air power, air power, and air power. Shirkey really, really loves air power. If there is sufficient demand for a seminar on the subject I imagine he could talk about it for literally days at a time if asked. 
I guess the course is hypothetically exploring ""how and why states and non-state actors use violent and non-violent strategies in international politics,"" according to the syllabus. In reality, I think it's a kind of disparate overview of topics that relate to international security and it isn't obvious why some topics are discussed and others aren't. It's not hugely centered on the U.S. perspective - Shirkey has an impressive command of history and the examples he cites are usually good for understanding the concept at hand and drawn from diverse periods in world history. But I'm not that certain that there is any strong theoretical impulse driving the course or that I have a better understanding of how states make decisions about their security at the philosophical level, although he and the readings do a good job of distilling the basis of decision-making processes at the micro-level of why, say, a state might abandon an alliance partner or launch a targeted air strike at a nuclear facility.
So: expect animated, interesting lectures and a detailed overview of each topic on the syllabus, and there isn't really an excuse for not knowing individual definitions on the exam as long as you come to class and take good notes. Do not expect that you'll be diving deep into military strategy or theory or reading tons of Clausewitz. From what I understand, Richard Betts's War, Peace and Grand Strategy is the best option for that. I'm hoping to take that in the fall and perhaps this course will serve as good preparatory material for that class. I did think the class was still worthwhile - probably the best political science course I've taken two years in as a major, not that that's necessarily saying all that much - and I think it's especially important to consider taking this class if you're really focusing on IR here.

Workload:
My main issues with the class came in the grading process. 
Here's a sample of the essay questions from the past semester:
(1) What obstacles do leaders, both military and civil, face when attempting to craft strategy?  Given these obstacles, is it possible for leaders to craft successful strategies or is war simply too complex and random for leaders to control?  If yes, how can the obstacles be overcome?  If no, why can they not be overcome?
(2) What is more important in determining a state’s foreign policy: its past history and reputation or cultural factors such as religion, national identity and national roles?
(3) Can air power win wars by itself? Given the significant air superiority the United States possesses over most of its potential enemies, should it focus on strategies that utilize mainly air power or will it need to use substantial ground forces as well?  Be sure to use historical examples and the readings.
The problem isn't wholly the prompts themselves so much as the fact that they realistically cannot remotely be answered in sufficient detail in the space allotted: 5 pages in length, double-spaced (1” margins, 12 point Times New Roman font). From memory that ends up being ~1600-1700 words per essay, each of which counts for 15 percent of your grade. To do well, you need to extensively cite the readings, reference lecture material, and have an original thesis - which is not necessarily possible for all the prompts. The TA even admitted that out of the 50-plus students in the class, only two argued that air power could win wars by itself for the third essay. The prompts tend to restrict the range of possible arguments you can use given the selected readings even if there are multiple possible perspectives you can take, and the questions are so broad that they are more deserving of a 10-page research paper than one 5-page paper that takes on undue significance in the overall course grade given its brevity. 
Possibly because one of the original two TAs took maternity leave, it felt like the TA and the professor's joint grading of the papers tended to be overly cursory and like the standards were unclear. They asked for original arguments (again, not always easily doable given the scope of the question - you'd have to be genuinely stupid or at the very least very good at BS-ing to write in favor of air power with the readings they assigned), and they also expected you to refute counterarguments, cite lecture, and use historical and statistical examples from lecture and the readings in your argument. It was thus often very frustrating to only have one or two comments from the TA or professor, depending on who was grading the essay, and they frequently just asked me (my friends in the class also experienced this) to expand on or include concepts that seemed tenuously related to the prompt. An example would be a TA comment telling me to talk about intelligence theory in my air power essay. Since they only give us 5 pages but each essay is still 15 percent of your grade, it seems strange to me to go through a paper and just leave a solitary comment telling us to talk more about some random, seemingly unrelated topic from the course instead of critiquing our argument in depth or our use of sources or whatever. I met with the professor a couple times to talk about essay grades and while he was helpful, the TA's grading style was consistently somewhat superficial. 
I would say it would be better for everyone involved - if the professor feels an essay component is really important - to have one or at most two essays assigned, ideally longer (7 to 10 pages) and dealing with a research topic related to international security. Since the work for the TA and the professor in grading will be less constant, it will hopefully also result in more detailed and meaningful grading. 
I didn't really have a problem with the way exams were graded. There are two, a midterm and a final. On the midterm you write one of two essay responses, and you're given the prompts a week in advance, and you fill out 10 IDs (no choice to leave any ID blank, but you don't need to because they are given out a week in advance as well on the study guide and are all covered in lecture). The final is similar - 10 IDs and you write two of four essays. The hardest part is usually remembering the names of all the authors, since you could plausibly be citing like 14 papers given that you have four different prompts to prepare for.
The actual grading scale, from talking to other people in the class, seems to average a B- or B on essays. The first midterm average was 80.1, which seems low for a political science course. I ended up getting an A- on the midterm, I think an A on the final, a B+, B+ and finally an A- on the last essay, for an A- in the class. Grading on the whole seems more rigorous and exacting than is typical for a political science course - which isn't in itself a problem, and like I said it's a pretty good course despite its flaws - but you should be forewarned about the somewhat unorganized syllabus and the unclear expectations particularly for essay grades. If I had any one point to make if the professor happens to read this, I would say that it is not really fair to grade as harshly as is usually the case on essays in the class if the prompts continue to be vague, they don't necessarily give a lot of room for the original arguments that are expected, and the grading is cursory. I think the class would be a lot better if there were fewer essays with more room for innovation and more comprehensive feedback on grades. Still, though, I liked the class and would take it again.

Have mixed feelings about this class. Took AP with Jae many years ago and can say that it was significantly better run and more structured than OS. He seemed much less prepared to teach this class. The content wasn't terribly interesting. We spent a lot of time on UNIX APIs and not enough time kernel hacking. It was an 8:40 am class so no one really showed up. It didn't really matter since Jae would just talk about a couple of functions from a man page for an hour any way. Most of the learning is done on your own by reading many chapters from 3 textbooks.
The first midterm was poorly written and essentially required you to know random facts from the textbook and didn't really test conceptual thinking. The second was slightly better but still overall not a great test.
The HWs were hard. Required a lot of reading of man pages, kernel code and experimenting. Doing it on your own was a miserable experience that led to many sleepless nights. Always felt pressed for time on the group projects. I never felt intellectually challenged by any of it but did feel like it was a lot of worked. There was never an aha moment where I appreciated the beauty of an operating system. It's just a mangled mess that we deal with since that's how some bloke decided things should be done many decades ago.
Ensure that you form a good team. They don't have to be incredibly smart, just very hardworking, sincere and accountable. Mine didn't do any work which led to a lot of incomplete homeworks since it's kind of impossible for one person to finish the HW on their own unless they're willing to devote well over 10 hrs/week to it.
Overall, I was slightly disappointed in this class given that I thought AP was fun and easy. Jae needs to step up his game here. You might want to take the class with Jason Nieh who is an OS researcher and will focus more on kernel programming, but be warned that his workload is even worse. I do think that every CS major should take OS. It's surprising that Columbia doesn't make it a requirement. That said, I begrudgingly took it.

This was a pretty decent class. Material was interesting and very applicable to daily life and the business world.

The mandatory attendance and iClicker quizzes were annoying.
Midterms were pretty straightforward if you studied for them. There was nothing that was challenging as long as you memorized all the terms she gives you in the review sheet and understand them at a basic level.

I have mixed feelings about this course. It repeats a ton of material from Data Structures, more or less on the same level. There is some new material, but it doesn't feel like a semester's worth. Overall, the material was not particularly interesting. I guess you learn all the standard algorithms you should know: the theory of divide-and-conquer and greedy algorithms, then some classic sorts and graph algorithms. 
The lectures were fine. A little slow, but presented reasonably. The slides are online, which is nice, and the textbook is pretty standard. The level of rigour was adequate.
However, the homeworks were painful. The problems themselves were not hard, but the TAs were brutal. They often complain about a supposed ""lack of rigour"". In a good math of theory class, you're supposed to write however much you need to show what you know. But in this class, you're supposed to write however much you need to show a toddler how to do it themselves. This felt like a waste of time for the students and the graders.

A fun class in machine learning. We covered a lot of basic algorithms that are important to machine learning, and we did it through a statistical lens, learning a lot about statistical modelling. One of the goals was building intuition for machine learning, and I would say it was achieved successfully. However, at times, I felt this came at the cost of skipping formal proofs. Although the algorithms seem to work in reasonable cases, there is never a real definition of the learning problem we are trying to solve. In this way, the classes seemed more about applying machine learning algorithms than proving their correctness.
The homeworks were reasonable, each had some math and some programming. We worked in R, and it was fairly easy to translate mathematical notation into code. The first exam was extremely challenging, the second was very easy. Presumably professor Cunningham is still trying to strike a balance there.

Professor Shen is the best calc Professor I've had thus far. I have taken two other calc classes before this and struggled both times. Unlike other professors, Shen is very straight forward; he does not try to trick you. His lectures are straight from the textbook, almost completely verbatim. If you can learn from just reading the textbook you definitely do not need to go to class. (He says so himself.)  He gets the questions for the midterms and final from the textbook! Some of the questions on the exams were even previously assigned for homework. It is literally that easy to study. When he had in class review before a test, I am pretty sure he is holding the test in his hand as he writes on the board exactly what we should study. Before the final, he wrote down specific examples from every chapter he insisted we should know how to solve. Some of those examples were on the final. I know that if I didn’t do good on an exam it is completely on me for not studying or practicing enough questions from the textbook. He can not make the exam simpler. The other calc 4 class that was occurring at the same time as this one with a different professor had an average on the first midterm of 50% while this class had an average of 75% - 15 out of 20 total points. The only con with his tests is that each questions is only worth about 3 points so losing a point here and there for a silly mistake actually does impact your grade. 
Additionally, he is a very nice person; very sympathetic! He stops his lectures to see if anyone has questions. You can ask as many questions as you need and he will patiently answer them. I know some students who freaked out before exams and emailed him for help and he always responded with reassuring words. I even know some students who asked to take the midterm a different day, either because they were actually really sick or because they honestly told him they would fail if they took it then, and he allowed it! Professor Shen even allows you to do an extra credit presentation. It is so rare to find a professor who will actually give extra credit. It’s clear that he does not want to fail you. 
He does have a bit of an accent but to me it was no problem. Just beware that he pronounces some words funny. (i.e what sounds like “de-man” is actually “domain” or “try-ple” is “triple”)
In all, definitely take Professor Shen’s class if you can, it is the most straight forward class you will find. There is a pretty good curve but I would say your grade mostly reflects the amount of work you put in, it’s that simple.

Before starting Lit Hum, I read the reviews about Nancy and saw that she was a silver nugget professor so I definitely had high hopes for a great experience. However, I was thoroughly disappointed with the outcome. This is the type of class where your performance is solely based on if the professor likes you or not. 
Professor Workman is knowledgeable, but she also only wants to hear what she wants to hear. In class discussions, her expressions and her opinions are written clearly on her face and she will make it explicitly clear by her facial expressions if she likes what you are saying or not. She cuts off students and also puts down students' comments or thoughts. It's pretty discouraging, especially as your first introduction to the Core. She has a set opinion on the texts and only wants to hear what SHE deems is important or interesting. Thus, the environment of the class was usually stifling and tense - students are always trying to one up each other and say something better than the previous person.  
In terms of class load, if you want to be able to spend time on your major courses or more important courses, than do not take this class as you have to turn in a 1-2 page response for EVERY CLASS. You're allowed 5 skips on the responses but it's not that helpful; you basically can't skip readings so you have to read everything. 
Her grading on the essays and midterms are also very harsh. If she doesn't like you, you won't do well in the class. A lot of people switched out of her section after the fall semester.  
Takeaway: Your Lit Hum experience is heavily, if not solely, based on your professor. So choose wisely. Good luck.

Professor Tommasino is encouraging, friendly, humorous, and really wants everyone in the class to do well! He is very knowledgeable as well as fun and makes you really interact with the texts and learn a lot from discussions. Plus, it's a pretty easy A as long as you are engaged during class discussions! 
After a pretty miserable fall semester of Lit Hum with a different professor, I switched into Prof. Tommasino's class and I am so thankful and glad that I did. 
His discussions are lively and energetic and students really want to participate. Whenever we start a new text, he usually goes over the context and sometimes a brief history about the book, the time period, and/or the author. He is funny and makes light-hearted comments throughout our discussions. 
He also really wants everyone to succeed and the class is designed so that mostly everyone does well. You can get by without doing all of the readings and it definitely helps to pay attention in class. He also allows computers which is a GREAT WAY to do some quick Sparknotes reading and type notes. 
He's on sabbatical this coming year, 2016-2017, but hopefully when he returns he'll continue to teach Lit Hum!

Took this class as an american politics elective. Really glad I did. In all honesty I was not all that interested in the topic, but rather it was the 3 take-home exam/essay format that sparked my interest. That said, I actually ended up enjoying the course (and not only because of the light, light workload), and do feel that I did gain a good amount of insight into the role that race and ethnicity play in american politics. Professor Smith is definitely old school, and opts for projecting his printed out slides rather than using the computer. Kind of quirky, but it works. Lectures really were not necessary at all since everything that was needed for the papers were in the books, but do beware that he begins taking attendance after the second take-home. Additionally, Professor Smith started each lecture with current-eventish type things that sometimes went on for half the class. Paper topics were kinda weird, and based on the discussion sections I was in I feel that the general consensus was that what was being asked for/how to craft your paper and answer the questions was a bit unclear. That being said, even though I did not feel all that confident in any of the papers I wrote, I received A's on the first two, and an A as my final grade (don't know about the third as those were due on the last day of class and were not returned). The readings for the course were not bad at all (nothing was super academic or tough to read), and of what I read (which was probably about 80%) I only read after the exams were handed out since I didn't see the point in reading anything prior to knowing what I was looking for. That said, do not leave both the readings and paper to the night before. You definitely need at least 2 days (I took 2-3). In addition to the 3 take-home exams we had to do a short issue brief (500-700 words) and a couple of posts to the discussion board. I had never dealt with issue briefs before, so I honestly had no idea what I was doing for the first draft. However, the first draft was graded only for completion, and we received feedback from our classmates and also had access to previous briefs done for the course prior to handing in the final draft. In conclusion, I'd definitely recommend this class. Professor Smith is very laid back and approachable, and it is clear that he is very interested in the topic. The lectures can be a bit dry at times, but you can definitely zone out or do other work during class time.

TAKE YAN LAOSHI'S CLASS! I don't know why she doesn't have more (recent) CULPA reviews. She is the sweetest, most adorable professor ever. I spent so much of both semesters of this class laughing, but also definitely learning Chinese. Her teaching style is super effective, and she gets everyone to participate. Most of the people that took the fall semester stayed with her for the spring, and I totally understand why. She clearly cares about her students, and does everything she can to help them. There are due dates on all assignments, but she basically always accepts work late, and even allows people to make up quizzes/memorizations. Chinese is obviously a tough language, and it's almost like learning two at once between the pinyin with tones and the characters, but the structure of the class really keeps you on top of things since there's almost always a quiz or test or memorization on any given day. If you can get into her section, definitely take it. I hated the 4:10-5:15 time slot, but I stuck with it. I'm so sad she doesn't teach intermediate because I cannot imagine that I will have a better experience with another Chinese professor than I have had with her!

This class was definitely not what I was expecting. I was sold and set on taking this class because of Elsa’s CULPA reviews, but I wish I would have dropped it early in the semester. The first day of class there was about 20 people, but by about week 5 we were down to 4 people. Four people. Elsa said her class was going to be really hard the first day, and she really meant it. She assigns these “paquete de deberes” which are work packets that are due every class, and oh my god do these take so long to do. They can take anywhere from 2 to 4 hours to do. Sometimes she would assign full documentaries, movies, or her giving an online 2-hour lecture and then you still had to answer questions on the packets. The work for these was excessive, we asked several times if she could assign less work and she promised the class would become easier by halfway through the semester. It never did.
Class time is always fun, which is probably the reason why I stayed. During class all we do is talk to a classmate about what we learned doing the paquete and she would answer questions we had. It would get slightly uncomfortable since there was only 4 of us and she could easily hear what we were saying, and every time we said something incorrectly she would write the correct word on the board. In such a small class you could not get away with not doing the assigned work. Her questions during class were so specific that it required doing the homework with extra attention. 
There are no quizzes or exams for this class, but there were 3 essays and 2 projects which required lots of time to do. The essays were short compositions, and she allowed 1 rewrite after giving you corrections. The corrections she gave back usually included 2 pages of her comments in red ink, which didn’t always seem constructive and bordered on being too harsh. Her midterm project and final were very tedious and took days to complete.
Elsa is a great instructor. She really does mean well and she wants you to learn. She’s kind and engaging, but I think she’s too eager and has unrealistic expectations for her students. This might have been her first time teaching in Spanish, and even though it’s a 3300 level-course, it was just too much. If you’re still interested in taking this class try it out for 2 weeks, and if it seems like a lot, drop it. The work will only get harder during the semester.

I'd like to bring a more positive note to this course's reviews:
This class is an ""experience,"" meaning there it's not about memorizing some facts and vomiting them on a page, its more about what you take from his class. A previous reviewer mentioned they didn't learn much, but thats not the only type of learning. He assigns readings, which only serve to catch you up to speed with the bio side of the ethical debate: you do have to know some facts about the scenario to truly understand what ethical questions arise. Aside from that he expects you to show up to class, once a week, and engage in a discussion about the ethical dilemmas of said issue. 
Now, it is true that Prof Loike can get curt sometimes (he'll cut you off in the middle of a point and start talking about something totally different), but that's mainly because he's trying to guide the discussion to his points of interest. It can be rough listening to someone argue a point about what might happen with biotech if the science already proves that you can control that aspect. He often mentions taking his arguments ""with a grain of salt,"" which is true because he does mention some disagreeable opinions given columbia's liberal community. The readings don't always match up with the class content but he'd catch you up to speed at the beginning of class in that case. 
Take away message: take this class with an open mind and try to participate because that's what he likes. Don't take offense to how he may respond to your comments in class and engage anyway. Overall, it can be a rewarding experience and a great way to learn about the future of biology and medicine with a focus on the ethical questions that come out of it.

I think this was Aled's last semester teaching UWriting, so really just take this as a warning for any future classes he may teach (lit hum? Oh God).
The other review is pretty dead on. Aled is charming, smart, funny, etc. Everyone loved his accent. I loved going to this class every day just because the discussions were so interesting. He chose very nontraditional data science readings, which I found to be really interesting but also very hard to write about. The class discussions didn't help clear them up, and it certainly didn't help that he would get distracted every 5 minutes and go off on tangents about films, Eurovision, his family, how much of a mess he is, etc. 
His biggest fault, imo, is that he tends to be very nice when looking at drafts but is absolutely savage when grading the final paper. For my first two papers, he wrote very nice comments on my drafts and I took those to mean that I was heading in the right direction. I fixed all the small mistakes he mentioned and took in the account bigger problems and tried to address those as well. You'd think doing that would get you in the A-range, but that really just brings you to a B+ most of the time. When grading the final draft, it seemed like he'd always be addressing problems which he never brought up before. It was so, so frustrating when he seemed to give the impression that he liked our papers at first but wouldn't really give helpful criticism until it was too late. For my P3, I completely ignored his comments on my drafts (which, as usual, just told me that I was heading in the right direction!) and rewrote the entire paper at one point because I personally didn't like how it was turning out, and ended up doing much better on my P3 than both my P1 and P2. 
Some advice: go to his office hours and argue with him. Ask which arguments sound weakest - he'll probably tell you - then ask him why they sound weak. Just argue with him a lot, and he'll usually drop lots of hints towards where he'd actually like to see you go with the paper. When talking face to face, he's usually better about giving out actual criticism, and I found that by arguing with him a lot I could figure out where my paper actually needed improvement. Bonus: he's really funny and super nice. Even for students who couldn't make his normal office hours, he was always super flexible about finding other times to meet with them. 
Aled was also notoriously slow with returning everything because he's ~sooo~ busy. He used to give us a writing exercise (usually a short response to a reading) due every class, but only returned about half of them and eventually just stopped assigning them halfway through the semester. Every single major deadline (a draft or final paper) was pushed back at least once, but usually more than once. I think we ended up turning in our P3s over 2 weeks later than originally assigned, and our P4 and radical revisions were straight up due during finals week. Our P2s were returned over a month after they were due. Some assignments were just never assigned, or would be assigned them abandoned partway through them. You can tell that Aled doesn't care much about how UW is supposed to be structured - my friend straight up didn't use the seed text, was hundreds of words over the word limit, and used too many sources in her P3, and he seemed to be completely fine with it. 
Despite his faults, Aled also made the class incredibly enjoyable. It was my favorite class this semester. Just stick through the frustrations and it will definitely be worth it. You might have to work a bit harder than students in other sections, but if you just put some effort into harassing him, you can get a lot out of his class.

This review ended up rather long, so TL;DR: this class is hard and confusing- do not take it!
Unfortunately, I strongly do not recommend taking this class. It was probably my least favorite class I ever had to take at Columbia (disclaimer: I just took it as a second semester senior so I may be biased, but I still think this is a very honest assessment). I wanted to avoid taking Machine Learning because I was trying to have a chill semester, but I wish I had instead.
Professor Pe’er is an extremely nice guy, which makes me hesitant to write a poor review, but I had a very bad experience with this class. The material is hard, but what truly made this class truly difficult is the lack of resources to learn from. Usually, I can rely on the lectures, class notes, or the textbook to learn the material for a class. However, I could not understand the lectures due to Professor Pe’er’s delivery and stuttering, the class notes were confusing and extremely difficult to study from, and there was no textbook.
Professor Pe’er has an accent, but it is the stammering and stuttering that made it almost impossible for me to understand what was going on in class. He also spoke through a microphone which further distorted his sentences. I’m not trying to exaggerate, but it took intense concentration and patience during lecture to make sense of each sentence for me (moreso than any lecture I’ve ever had). Eventually, as a second semester senior, it was just too much effort for me and I was mostly zoned out during class.
There was no textbook to learn the material from. Thus, I was left with learning from the class powerpoints. The slides did not contain full explanations of concepts and diagrams, so they were very hard to decipher. I mostly ended up googling topics and watching Youtube videos to try and learn the material. This class is a mix of computer science, biology, and statistics and the material is unsurprisingly very hard to understand.
The problems sets were long and extremely difficult (8 in total). Most of the questions were worded poorly and required extensive clarification on Piazza before you could understand them. Given that the material itself was difficult and confusing, they took me hours and hours to complete. After a couple problem sets, I just stopped caring and scribbled down whatever work that looked okay because it wasn’t worth the time stressing over it.
For the midterm, you had to answer 3/8 questions. Not surprisingly, it was hard as well- the average was a 64. It was open book/note, but I didn’t even use anything I brought in. Afterwards, he gave us an extra credit assignment where we had to solve 3 more of the midterm problems (full credit received half the points between your grade and the highest class grade). If you do take this class, I would just focus on learning on 2-3 of the main topics that will appear on the exam (BWT, HMMs, etc.).
The project was okay. I was worried our project was too simple because everyone else’s sounded complicated, but most groups didn’t come close to getting good results so don’t overexert yourself.
In conclusion, this was one of the most frustrating and challenging classes I took as an undergrad, and unfortunately it was during my last semester here. Avoid taking it, unless you are truly interested in the subject- just take ML!!!! Sorry Professor!

Alright, so you basically don’t have to do anything the entire semester, until the last week. Then all you have to do is write a final paper (10-20 pages) that’s worth 100% of your grade. If you go to all the recitations and either give a short recitation presentation or write a short review paper, then the final paper is worth 70% of the grade. If you go to some recitations and your presentation/review paper is mediocre, the final paper is worth 85%.
I figured that the final paper is pretty much going to decide your grade, so I didn’t go to class or recitation, and then wrote the paper during the last week. I spent a good amount of time on it (I mean, it’s the only assignment you have to do) and did well on it. The end. I don’t know if Professor Burgstaller is an easy or hard grader, but you can’t complain about the workload.
For those of you who do care about the material, Professor Burgstaller is a nice guy who sends lecture summaries and blackboard pictures every week. From the time I was in class, he was a little dry but very knowledgable. The class material is definitely interesting and a nice change of pace from the typical economics electives, but I was a second semester senior and didn’t really care about learning the material.

Deopurkar is a very good teacher. It’s a pretty standard math class. Weekly problem sets, some were easy and some were hard. The 2 midterms were pretty straightforward, with problems that were similar to the homeworks and practice problems. The final was pretty hard for me- it seems like he made the problems more tricky than the midterms, and some of the calculations just didn’t work out for me.

Considering the reviews below, I thought this was going to be a terrible class, but I wanted fulfill an econ elective and a global core. And honestly, for me at least, this class wasn’t bad at all. It was definitely worth it.
The midterm and final consists of short answer questions (just need to write a phrase or a sentence or two). These questions pretty much all came from the powerpoint lectures and readings (the slides discuss the readings, so you don’t need to do them). I thought this was pretty great- nothing confusing, you just need to read the lecture slides. Yeah it requires memorization, but so does every other class. In other econ classes, you need to memorize formulas, how to solve problems, and concepts. If you don’t like reading slides, then don’t take this class.
The guy below is complaining about it being an 8:40- no one is forcing you to take an 8:40. Just get a friend to sign you in if you don’t want to go, or alternate. You can sign in and leave or just go at the end of class.
Prof. Lincoln is very knowledgable and his interest in the topics is very evident. He does follow the lecture slides, but he definitely adds explanation and other information. I thought the material was pretty interesting; I learned a lot about the history of Japan and their economic progress. Yeah it sucks at 8:40, but you really don’t have to go.
The paper can be about any topic involving Japan and economics, whether modern or historical. You have pretty much the whole semester to write it, but you’ll probably write it a couple days before. But make sure to talk to Lincoln about your paper topic, because he’ll give you good feedback.
From the guy below- “This class was literally the bane of my existence this past semester.” I can’t really see how this is possible; the class is just a straightforward midterm, final, and a paper. The attendance factor is annoying, but if you get someone to sign you in, alternate, or just sign in and then go back to bed, then it’s really not a big deal. Definitely worth it for double counting a class.

David is a true baller. He's a PhD student, so he probably won't be teaching at Columbia for too long, but you should definitely take Intro to Digital Music with him if he's teaching it.
At the risk of being obtuse, this class is mainly an introduction to digital music production. A lot of class time is spent going through the basic functions of Logic (the main software for production on Macs). If you already have a background in production, this might get tedious. Most people in the class don't, so this time is well spent—and David is really good at going into the right amount of depth about each topic and giving a flavor of the history behind certain production techniques.
However, there are a couple things that make this class so much more than just a string of tutorials:
1. We had an excellent guest lecture on the history of reverb (at least 10 times more interesting than it might sound)
2. an up-and-coming indie band (Salt Cathedral) came in to show us a session of a professionally produced song and talk about production techniques
3. we spent some time talking about sound design for film and how to use Logic to work with film
Also, David was extremely helpful and eager to share his knowledge. He's done a lot of amazing things and was very inspiring to work with.
If you already have some proficiency as a producer, this probably isn't the right class for you. But for anyone else with even a peripheral interest in music of all kinds, this has the potential to be a life-changing class.
Workload:
Light. The entire workload consisted of two open-ended composition projects (e.g. ""Make a song that's at least two minutes long"") and one sound design project (i.e., given a two-minute clip from a film without audio, create all the audio). You'll get as much out of this class as you put into it.

This is the most difficult course I've ever taken regarding content, but that is clearly understood in the grading process. If you are engaged and interested in class you will do well. John Hunt is possibly the most intelligent person I have met, but he is still approachable and willing to absolutely everything to help his students understand. However, these qualities seemed to cause some time-management issues and the class fell behind. Because the course is relatively new and the material comes easily to him, he occasionally spent too much time on easier topics and was forced to rush through the more difficult ones. He has made screencasts for most of the material now. If future students actually allow him to use the flipped format I don't think this will be a problem, but speaking out in this class is particularly intimidating. He will likely still get behind because he has a lot of responsibilities and he takes all of them seriously. 
So take the class if you want to be challenged to think deeply about a cool topic from a brilliant, understanding, approachable professor. Don't take it if you're stressed out by last minute schedule changes.

Avoid taking this professor because statistically speaking, you aren't going to do well.  Uribe curves this class so that the average is going to be a B.  I don’t think Uribe understands how curving and grading works.
Reference sheets are not allowed so the midterm and final were like memorization tests rather than conceptual tests.  If you simply regurgitate and memorize the lecture notes, you will do well on the exams.
All that happens in class is Uribe derives equations which are already derived in the posted lecture notes.  Going to class is not needed to do well on the homeworks and exams.  Just memorize the lecture notes.

While I would say that this class had a relatively average workload, I feel that it is quite necessary to highlight some of the Mutch's deceiving characteristics. At first, one would come across this professor as a socially awkward PHD grad. It is impossible to have a conversation with him without the inclusion of awkward silences and it is even more impossible to take him seriously considering that he is the type to wear running shoes with cargo shorts. For the most part, his classes consisted of a 40 minute lesson on the composer, and the remaining minutes were attributed to students asking questions like ""how much did Beethoven make"" or ""did Stravinsky take drugs"". Very often he would try to imitate the songs on the piano but did so with many mistakes. Therefore it would have been better off not listening to it as opposed to him indirectly bragging about how he plays the piano. It was easy to bullshit in his class considering that no one read the book nor was it really required. The discussion posts were completely subjective, so very often you can get away with writing your own opinion as opposed to discussing what the readings were about.  His “pop” quizzes every week were relatively easy but you have to know everything about the song’s name to get full credit. This means that Symphony no. 5, Movement 2  is worth half a point where as Symphony No. 5, Movement 2, Op 30 is worth a full point. This is where I go off on his conniving nature.
At first I wanted to sympathize with this professor since he looked like the type to get bullied in school for listening to Bach during his lunches and recesses. I also thought he was a virgin considering that he clearly jerked off to the likes of Mozart and Handel while drinking a warm glass of milk before bedtime. (Trust me, when he speaks about any composer, there is an immediate jolt of energy and his pants get wet). Mutch keeps much of his animosity towards students to himself, and decides to lay into you either through your essay or participation grade. He shows no visible signs of hate, so IF you decide to take his class, try your best not to laugh at him (despite how hard it is not to) or go on your phone (despite how boring his class is) because he sees everything even with his lice-infested, ungroomed beard that covers the majority of his face. Make sure to participate because he takes it very seriously and will dock off points for not doing so - however he will never call anyone out for not doing nor will he show you any signs of how much he hates you.
His essays are generally easy prompts, but do not take this lightly – he will grade it harder than you expect, especially the first one. The final exam was also quite easy considering that it was multiple choice and 2 essays that were subjective and a comparison. Once again, don’t be tricked, he grades the essays harder despite how easy the questions are.
All in all, I received a good grade, but would have definitely been higher if it was with another teacher. I didn’t really work hard but that was also because Caleb is a joke. He is heartless and won’t round your grade up as well. Try to find another teacher, but I guess he is not the worst out there.

If you have Humberto for Lit-Hum, you just won the lottery.
Humberto is absolutely brilliant. He is a master at instigating meaningful, provocative class discussion, and his insight into the texts is fantastic and life-changing. Generally, class begins with either a reading quiz (which everyone typically fails, but it doesn't really impact your grade) or a passage/scene from the reading. From there class rockets off into scintillating debates on passages Humberto selects for us to close-read. Humberto will oftentimes mix up class agendas; several times he asked each person to prepare a 5 minute speech in the spirit of the Symposium or other, which we would then share with the class. Class time was always spent valuably, and I enjoyed every minute (seriously, every minute) of it this year.
As if that wasn't enough for you, Humberto is also a genuine, sweet, and lovely human being. One thing I particularly loved is how we would read the texts through a very human lens. It was okay to not understand something, or to voice a strong opinion about one of the characters, or to simply say you loved how a certain scene made you feel. Humberto makes the literature fun and personally engaging, and his kindness and genuine compassion for his students creates a classroom environment that feels like home. 
I honestly can't say enough wonderful things about Humberto. If you have him, you will have the best experience ever.

Well, it's Lit-Hum, but Humberto makes it pretty easy. He is an extremely generous grader (he really wants you to do well!) but don't take advantage of this. Humberto is too good to be treated as somebody who will give you an easy A. He wants to make Lit-Hum enjoyable for you, so do your part!

Taking these courses was probably the worst decision I made at Columbia! I did well, but the experience was taxing, demoralizing, and thankless. The lectures themselves are fine—not earth-shattering as people claim—but the exams are outrageous. Some questions are fair, but others are ambiguous in their wording and meaning to the nth degree, and are testing us on how well we can intuit what was *meant* to be asked, without being given enough information to know for certain. Basically we're betting. 
I know people beg to differ on this point, but I am an experienced test-taker, am totally capable of critical thinking and deduction, and knew the course material backwards and forwards (spent countless hours at recitation, reading the class notes, re-listening to the lectures, working through the problem sets, etc.). I am certain that in many cases these weren't edifying puzzles we were solving, but intentional obfuscations.
In short, unless you have a taste for aggravation, ambiguity, and fear-mongering, don't take this class! And if you do take it, do not for a minute let anyone make you feel stupid for not being adept at solving ""Mowshowitz problems""; it isn't a reflection on your intelligence, or a prognostic for your future, in any way.

Prof. Blaer really reached out to me in a personal way to make both Intro to CS and Data Structures meaningful courses for me. Blaer is an expert in the field of computer science (also, has special interests in robotics programming), speaks [loudly and] clearly during lectures, has a dry but relatable sense of humor, and is generally an approachable friendly human.  
tl;dr I highly recommend Blaer for CS major courses: 'Introduction to CS in Java' and 'Data Structures in Java'.

Professor Aftab is excellent! He structures the course well, reviewing the very basic at the beginning and picking up the pace as the semester progresses. Over time, he incorporated more reading such as news articles and longer/more difficult passages. The spring semester of UFHS was more work than the Fall semester but it was definitely more enjoyable as well. I picked up so much vocabulary and many grammar constructions. Taking it a yearlong instead of just the Fall definitely improved my speaking and listening skills because at the end of the Fall my reading and writing improved quickly but listening to news and having conversations or debates with good vocab was still difficult. After UFHS with Aftab, you'll be ready for the world! You don't just learn Urdu, the interesting topics covered in the class expose you to an array of different thoughts and give you a new angle to look at and understand life and many cultural issues central to South Asia. 
Do note that how much you learn in this course depends on how much effort you put in. Some people wrote a paragraph for daily homework for example that for analysis of a passage and some wrote 2 pages. If I liked a topic in particular I sometimes spent an hour or two writing my views on something because I would read up on it and look up urdu words etc.

The MOST boring class you'll ever take. Sure he's easy but you're also wasting your time. He takes attendance because he knows no one would even show up otherwise. The things he says will make you wonder if he's actually lost it. The only reason students take this course is because it's easy. He puts in very little effort into this class, making the same exact remarks and lame jokes day after day and reading out loud passages that were assigned. The only assignments you hand in are 3 very short responses written in a way he WANTS you to write. He literally gives a paper with instructions on how to begin and write your ""paper"". Then he complains about reading those ""papers"" but really his TAs read and grade the assignments who also think this class is a joke.

Prof Beer isn't that bad. 
After reading the CULPA reviews, I was nervous to take Chem II with him and thought it was going to be a horrible experience. However, it wasn't bad at all and I actually did better this semester than last semester in Savisky's Chem I.
Chem II is a lot of problem solving so as long as you know the general concepts and how to employ the formulas you should be fine. Prof Beer also gives you all of the formulas on a sheet so there's no need to memorize them.
Most people don't come to lecture. In my class of about 100 (?) people, at max. 30 people would come to lectures. Prof Beer writes on the chalkboard, which initially was kind of annoying because I was used to powerpoint, but you get used to it after a few classes. He also posts all of his lecture notes on courseworks.
The lectures can be pretty dry, especially when he derives formulas, which is unnecessary because he gives them to you on every quiz and exam. However, he usually explains the concepts well, although I'd recommend doing the textbook reading and taking notes before coming to lecture so you already have a better grasp on the material.  He also goes over problems in class that usually appear in a slightly different form on the exams, so it's important to know how to do those.
Sharon was the best TA ever. She makes sheets with important terminology and formulas and chooses problems from the homework questions that are more important. Rose was not a good TA, perhaps from lack of experience. She also speaks way too softly and isn't clear about what she's doing. So if Sharon and Rose are the TA's next year (even in Chem I), definitely choose Sharon. Her quizzes aren't easy, but you can do well.
The exams were a lot harder than Savisky's, but the average was also lower (usually around 15-17 out of 25). However, there are problems that you can get each time and its only the last few in each section that are usually more difficult

Optional homework problems (probably around 20 per chapter?), but I'd highly recommend doing them to prepare for quizzes and as extra preparation for exams (besides the 2 practice exams Prof Beer provides)

Professor Birch is an overall very good professor.
The readings - personally, I found almost all to be very interesting. The ones I didn't find interesting I simply didn't write about.
Discussions - Campbell is a fantastic discussion leader. He's smart, calculated, and somehow manages to listen to every single comment. I really enjoyed the discussion. The discussions were rarely about with the actual process of writing, but rather about the merits of the reading.
Grading - While I believe that the UW bias exists in this class as well, and people are somewhat labeled for their grade, at least half of the class got A/A-. He's not a harsh grader at all, he's very critical and had great, really in-depth remarks.
Campbell is very accessible whether through emails, meetings, after class or OH. I believe that you can greatly improve your writing if you take advantage of all of this.

Professor Gulati is one of the best professors I've ever had!
Teaching: Gulati is clear, concise, eloquent, and has an overall very effective teaching style. He obviously knows the material, uses no notes but misses nothing, knows how to steer the class towards where he wants the class to be and knows how to improvise when it doesn't go as planned.
Accessibility: surprisingly accessible after class, in OH. Quickly responds to emails. That said, he kind of expects you to ask the TAs course-related questions.
General: most importantly, Gulati enjoys the interaction with the students. He truly cares about the students personal opinions (or at least acts like he does really well). He enjoys teaching and it's both fun and demanding being in his class!
If you want to stay on top of your game in this class you have to do the reading before class. If you do that and revisit the material while learning for the pop quizzes, an A is very doable.

Ah, what to say about sauer-Krauss. 
I think that first and foremost taking the 20th century course is necessary and extremely helpful if you're an art history major.  Although Prof. Krauss is typically scattered, technologically challenged, and intimidating, I learned so much about modern and contemporary art because Krauss introduces numerous of theories and essays by art critics, historians, artists (whom you will later find out are basically her colleagues).  Everything she talks about is highly important, and the readings, sooner or later, are necessary and important pieces of literature.  I don't agree with others that you can just get away with browsing/shopping on the internet during class or just not showing up at all, because most of the summaries you read online are subjective and usually omit important points about a piece of artwork.  The textbook is reasonably priced, especially for an art book, and it is an enjoyable read (also makes for a nice decoration on the coffee table!) The workload is more than reasonable (weekly readings, 1 paper, 1 midterm, and 1 final). I love Krauss.  She made me crack up in every class.

I'd first off like to point out that this class had plenty of potential. There are some very relevant bioethical issues that need attention, and discussion on these topics could have been really eye opening and engaging. Professor Loike was able to bring some of these topics to light, but handled them very poorly. During class Loike was very egocentric;  he held class by asking a question then interrupting students until he got the answer that he was looking for. 
He did have some speakers who came into class, some of whom had nothing to do with biomedical engineering and some of whom were not knowledgable. One such person was not able to answer questions about how her work was pertinent to our studies. However, he did have a few interesting people come in, including representatives from the FBI. While these guest speakers are here, Loike leaves, is on his cell phone, or falls asleep.
The assigned textbook for this class is written by him, and he requires that we all purchase it. I regret dropping $40 on this text that I only read twice because I though I should give this class some effort. (This money and effort did not translate to any returns on investment.)
This was a fairly easy class, but I think my brain melted a little while taking it.

Oh lord, what a wonderfully useless class. I'm the type of person that goes to every class, reads every homework assignment and takes copious lecture notes, but, after the midterm, I hardly went to class, didn't do a SINGLE reading after the midterm (not one, I swear) and didn't take even a page of notes and got an A-. That's because your midterm and final are (in-class) open-internet. Yes. Open-internet. As in, he gives you some questions and you google it (aka, Wikipedia, which is allowed) and answer them. You're not even expected to use class readings because, as prof. Martin stresses, he's not interested in ""what you know,"" he's interested in ""how you think."" Additionally, the two short papers that you have to write don't relate to the readings either. Human rights majors, this class is a gift to you, as it counts for your intro class. On the other hand, it's a complete and utter waste of time if you know even the basics about human rights and the UN. I mean, really, for the second half of the semester, ""homework"" consisted of links to websites that gave outlines of human rights topics (not even readings?) as well as REPEATS of readings that we already did. Really a huge waste of time, but also an easy A.

She's a really sweet lady who definitely cares about her students. Her intro class was incredibly easy if you took AP Econ but super boring, as you can tell she isn't interested in hearing it again just as you. She's really good about covering most things in class and posting slides, so you can definitely get away with not reading the book if you have AP experience.
Her macro class is significantly better and you can tell she gets excited about certain topics. Still a little dry, but a very doable (although you 100% need to read the book since a lot of questions come out of book examples). The TA, Luis, however, is extremely unhelpful, often got questions wrong, and recitation was a waste of time. Go to Quella! She is super willing to sit down with you even though she's a bit awkward.

Arthur is the instructor that I have always envisioned I would have at Columbia. Arthur embodies everything I was looking for in a professor from such a prestigious institution of higher education: caring about his students' learning, not ""robbing"" us from the beauty of arriving to conclusions ourselves by igniting discussions, critical thinking and debates through his intellectually challenging questions instead of just giving us information through one-way teaching (professor-student). I always felt comfortable to affirm my opinions without fearing I would be judged or contradicted by my instructor or my classmates - and this is due to the engaging, positive and safe atmosphere that Arthur ensures to be the background for the most interesting discussions I have ever had in my life prior to Columbia. Having been accustomed to an educational system in which I would discuss just the form of a text and the reasons why characters were positive, negative or complex, now with Arthur stressing that it is far more important to delve into the character's ""thinking"" processes and the aims that drive their actions (which simultaneously helped me understand human behavior), I can affirm with certainty that I am a much more critical reader. Thanks to Arthur, I do not trust any information that any text, author, work gives me, but read the text against itself and question aspects I would not have had in the past. Thanks to Arthur, I now experience the beauty of critical reading, the beauty of reading texts and feeling that I am not undergoing a passive activity but rather an investigation with every written work that I delve in. 
During the trip at The MET, I realized how much knowledge I acquired after just a couple of months at Columbia even just by taking this course. It was extremely fascinating to see how all the ancient writings that we read connected to ancient art. Although I was mesmerized by all the correlations between Herodotus', Homer's and Euripides' works with the art pieces we saw, I found particularly interesting how during the visit we touched upon how the Romans imitated bronze Greek sculptures and right the day after the visit we read a passage acknowledging bronze sculptures in Virgil's Aeneid which we then connected to Virgil's inspiration in Homeric works etc.

Abby teaches UW in Sustainable Development. If you are so fortunate to have her as your teacher, stay in the class. You WILL work a lot but cannot describe how much your mind will have grown after the most intellectually provoking class for freshmen at Columbia.
UW was a class in which I became more aware of myself and the world around me. This conclusion is a result of having an instructor like Abby.
I have never had a more inspiring professor than Abby - one of the very few people whom I consider purely brilliant. Abby is one of the most intelligent people I have ever met and one of the most inspiring critical thinkers. I usually do not even go to office hours in my other classes, yet I went to 80% of Abby's, just because, on the one hand, her very optimist demeanor made me trust myself and inspired me to immediately go to explore the ideas we were generating together, and on the other hand, her very fast and research-oriented thinking allowed me to have the most intellectually stimulating conversations in my life. In a world abundant in hackneyed ideas, where sometimes you feel that everything has been explored and there have been so many ongoing discussions on almost any topic you might think of, Abby showed me how to bring my own contribution in an innovative way. 
Before University Writing, I thought that having a decisive conclusion/opinion on a topic was impossible given the myriad of argument and counterarguments one can find. Yet, through P2 and P3, I realized that researching, exploring a conceptual problem from many and contrasting angles, allows you to hold an opinion on a topic and gives you trust to sustain it. Abby taught me for the first time in my life to start an essay with a question I wanted to answer -- not a claim disguised in a dishonest question. Thanks to her constant support (challenging me with further and even more intellectually stimulating questions on my topic, teaching me how to not distort the data and quotes that I find in order to fit my ""evidence"" and instead see them as an opportunity to explore even more my question, summarizing my sometimes disordered ideas), I had some of the most rewarding moments in my life: the satisfaction of coming up with my own claims after a most intellectually engaging research. 
Furthermore, I cannot thank Abby enough for how supportive she was of everyone's ideas. This attitude can only show how -- not even open-minded, because it would be too modest a description -- intelligent she is, for an intelligent person is, above all, curious. An intelligent person sees ideas everywhere and is interested in how everyone came to think an idea, which is what Abby did every single time we met with her. 
All in all, even if I had just taken Abby's class, I am confident I could have called my Columbia experience truly transformative. 
Finally, I want to add a last note. I went to the writing center a couple of times and was never satisfied, I always felt I was losing and wasting my time trying to explain to the instructors my ideas and they were understanding them very slowly, having me to repeat them etc. etc., yet with Abby, who even anticipated what I wanted to say, everything was so much different. Also, when Abby had to be replaced once, another UW instructor came in and it was then that I was completely certain that it was nothing about the course that made our classes extraordinary -- it was just Abby's way of teaching it. With Abby, time flew and did not know how to take more advantage of every single minute spend in a class coordinated by such a gifted person, whereas with the other instructor I was constantly looking at the wall clock. I am not saying that the other instructor was not an expert in writing; what I want to express is that Abby is a genuine professor. 
Abby is a genuine expert in writing, but so are many writers - what makes her the best professor I have ever had is that Abby has genuine pedagogical and  communication skills and, above all, a superior ability to think critically. 
In terms of feedback, never have I seen such a dedicated professor. She volunteered to even record herself giving feedback, on top of writing very insightful comments! Never has she refused to meet up with me during office hours and she has always responded to my emails as well. 
I appreciate my instructor immensely and I thank Columbia for hiring such uniquely gifted people like Abby, who have offered me the possibility to develop as a critical thinker in one year, especially the last semester with UW, more than I had in all the previous years of my education.

I got randomly assigned to Mr. Williams's class last semester. He told us on the first day of class that he was a tough teacher. On the strength of the reviews I found here, I thought, ""Oh, I can handle tough. And it seems like he'll actually be able to teach me something as opposed to just wasting my time!"" I was sadly mistaken. He was the worst teacher by far I had this year. I found myself avoiding thinking about the class whenever possible. 
Mr. Williams is an incredibly unfair and harsh grader. He ripped all of my drafts to shreds, only to point out totally new flaws in my final draft, usually things that had existed in previous versions of my papers that he had neglected to point out. I'm currently in the process of contesting my grade, as are a number of others in my class. I'm not a bad student, and I typically get A-range grades on papers for other courses, not just Lit Hum. But I'm wary of this review sounding like a ""wahh I got a bad grade in this course and so I'm going to complain about this teacher to make myself feel better."" 
I can assure you that's not the case. Grades don't matter in the long term. What matters is the way this class made me feel, which was miserable. I was constantly frustrated with Mr. Williams, both for his arbitrary and unfair grading and for his hypocrisy. He gave us numerous lectures on the importance of punctuality and not wasting our time when tuition is so high, only to be at least three to five minutes late to class. He also constantly pushed back the dates he told us he would give us our papers back, despite stressing the importance of sticking to a deadline. As a result of this delay in grading, I didn't get my second paper back until there were only three weeks left in the semester. I dreaded every second of this class and implore anyone considering taking UW with him to reconsider. It made me miserable. I don't know how the other reviews could possibly be so positive, except that maybe Mr. Williams had a personality transplant.

For juniors and seniors studying applied math, the seminar provides an opportunity to learn directly from both outside speakers and peers on various topics in applied math. Seniors have to prepare a 75 minute presentation on a topic to share with the rest of the class. Professor Wiggins is very helpful in assisting with the presentation, and he provides guidance on how to best approach your topic (both qualitatively and quantitatively, as he will assist with both outlining your talk and also will help you better research your topic). The key is to pick a topic that you are passionate about and would like to spend time researching and learning about on your own. I found that I not only enjoyed researching my topic, but also that it bridged connections between various applied math courses (whereas courses may not directly build on each other, it was interesting to see the connections between them in a single application). Many presentations also draw on results from the last hundred years (if not more recently) and this is also an exciting complement to other courses. Reflecting on the seminar, I can say it has been a great experience in terms of being able to connect with applied math students and also learning about the numerous ways applied math affects daily life (in many cases, in ways you wouldn’t have known existed before taking the seminar).

You're a lucky student if you get Nicole Callahan as your CC teacher. She made CC incredibly interesting and entertaining. She really understands her students and tries to relate the texts to situations that we might face so that we can understand the texts better.  Most text discussions would start out as little group discussions and if we got stuck on an idea she would steer us in the right direction. She also made the class feel very familiar with each other so you were very comfortable sharing your ideas every time you stepped into the class. Furthermore, she usually baked us something!

This class was the best sort of class I can imagine - not too much work and mind-blowingly interesting.  I'm not an English or Film major, I just took the class based on the material and the professor's reputation.  I'm so glad I did.  For a long time I had been looking for an excuse to watch The Godfathers and The Sopranos and this class gave me the perfect opportunity. How can you beat a class where your homework consists largely of watching hours and hours of HBO? Also, Pedatella is totally a phenomenal instructor. Very cool, down to earth, knows everything about the subject and is really passionate about it.  And he brought us all cannolis the last day of class (I mean, how cool is that).

Professor Halpern-Leistner's class was an absolute disaster. I took Calc III because I had heard it was easier than Calc II. I immediately regretted this decision, however. After the first week, more than half of the class dropped the course. Professor HL was obviously new at teaching and did not explain concepts well. Additionally, his homework assignments were nearly impossible and not even the TA's could do the problems. Quizzes were also extremely difficult. I highly recommend steering clear from this class.

If you happen to be browsing Culpa for history professors and randomly find Mark Lilla, or are remotely interested in his provocative class titles, or already have experience with his thought via the New York Review of Books, you’re in luck. You’ve found Columbia’s secret sauce. Prof. Lilla’s teaching convinced me that studying history was the right way to go, but more importantly defined my academic existence as junior unsure of his next academic steps. It is admittedly hard to provide anything more than a gestalt review of Lilla’s classes; taking a course with him (and the cohort of undergraduates and graduates who religiously enroll in his seminars) is really an experience in itself. I’ll try my best.
Professor Lilla structures his classes in the following way: He identifies an important theme or author in intellectual history (Pascal, Rousseau, Montaigne, the self, education, etc.), and provides a hyper-focused syllabus aimed at investigating this topic. The key is depth, not breadth, and the assigned readings every week are usually short yet demanding. In his Pascal class, we read the entirety of Pascal’s Pensées and some of Montaigne’s Essais for context. While the assigned readings may only have been 50 pages or so per week, the material required a lot of time and contemplation (the Rousseau readings, it should be said, were considerably longer). 
If you are not interested in philosophy, political theory, religious thought, or literature, Lilla’s offerings may not be the classes for you. That being said, his Pascal course was my first real exposure to religious thought outside of CC and Lit Hum, and I found it eye-opening. So keep yourself vulnerable. Just know that Prof. Lilla sort of floats around between departments, and assigning disciplinary adjectives to his courses is accordingly difficult. 
Professor Lilla can be intimidating to an undergrad. He’s no nonsense and expects every student in his classes to be fully dedicated to the books at hand (they all are). In my experience, History, Philosophy, and English majors populate the classes, with the occasional graduate student peppered in. Many students are repeat offenders, sticking with Prof. Lilla after taking Lit Hum with him or another one of his courses. Preparation for each class entails reading the assigned portions of whatever books the class is focused on… and the discussion posts.
At the beginning of the first class, professor Lilla divides the students into two “teams” that contribute long papers and short responses on alternating weeks. This is a unique choice, I think, and it forces everyone in the class to synthesize and articulate their ideas from week to week. He usually makes long posts due three days before class, and responses due two days before. It might be a good idea, by the way, to print the whole discussion board from Courseworks out each week and bring it to class, as Prof. Lilla frequently pivots the discussion based on the posts. Don’t be surprised if he calls on you to explain what you wrote; chances are, if he does, he thinks you have something of interest to say!
The final paper is a long essay that deals with a question you work on with professor Lilla in office hours and over email. It’s really an investigation into a central question related to the syllabus and themes brought up in class— not sure how much more specific I can get, other than mentioning that you aren’t required to consult outside sources. He does give the option for spring students, however, of writing a much longer paper that involves outside reading and is due even further into the summer. It’s worth noting, too, that, in both cases, you’re given a very long time to write these papers. He expects good work.
Office hours were always helpful, and Prof. Lilla really goes the extra mile in trying to help his students along their ways. He is broadly an expert in many fields of ~Western~ intellectual history; if you have any extra-curricular questions about European liberal thought, American conservatism, French politics, classical literature (…) you might want to pop into office hours and ask away. Chances are you will disagree with his worldview. That's valuable at Columbia and—who knows—that disagreement might be temporary. 
Unless he's teaching particle physics, take his class. Also, he should have a gold nugget.

This review may not speak to the content of 1007 so much as the culture, but I would like to note to incoming students that this class has a surprisingly pre-professional and competitive atmosphere. I remember on the first day, Kender listed a number of languages - Perl, Python, C++, and asked students to raise their hands whenever they heard a language with which they had experience. I immediately felt so lost; I'd signed up for the course knowing just what was required to take it. I was, in fact, prepared for the course. I'd taken AP Java in high school; I'd done well; I for the most part continued that trend in 1007. But there wasn't a moment of this class I didn't spend questioning my abilities or worth as a CS student, even when I did quite well on the assignments. 
There were a lot of things Kender could have done to abate or eliminate this competitive aspect of the class, but instead he seemed to constantly make choices that worsened it. First of all, he'd post a list of the naked grades (everyone in the class' grades stripped of names) after every assignment. Seems whatever, but he did it in a way that each row would represent a person, and each column their grades on a particular assignment. To me, this seemed like an overabundance of information; Kender could have released the mean and perhaps standard deviation for each assignment, like most CS classes do, and that would've been enough information to know your approximate standing in the class. Second of all, after every naked grade set was posted, some guy would post in-depth stats on Piazza on the grade distribution, which was pretty unhealthy, grade-focused BS. I wish Kender had shut that down.  Third, at the end of the class, Kender sent an email to all students naming those who got an A+, as well as saluting certain members of the class who he felt had made significant contributions (like Piazza posts etc.). This is something I've never seen a professor do before -- if you do well in a class, you should know it without the professor emailing all your peers. The email also privileged certain modes of achievement in a field that, right now, desperately needs a diversity of thinkers and personality types. I'm not saying those students that Kender singled out don't deserve praise; but it would have been much more appropriate had Kender kept those thank-yous and A+s confidential. 
Those are just, to be clear, a few select examples of a trend of competitiveness that pervaded this class. Oh, and by the way, after all of this Kender had the nerve to complain (in that same final email) about how our class seemed more pre-professional than usual, as if he hadn't contributed at all to the atmosphere. When I read that, I actually laughed out loud. 
In terms of the course itself, I have few complaints. The material was truly interesting, and genuinely helpful to me as a programmer. Kender was a great lecturer, happily supplied all kinds of interesting supplementary information on Courseworks, and patiently explained concepts in person and on Piazza (even on the weekends). The class was difficult at times, but I learned so much about good design and feel like I have a great grasp of object-oriented programming now. I find myself applying design patterns + strategies I learned in this class all the time. In fact, I can't imagine where I'd be as a programmer without 1007. That's why it's such a shame that the class atmosphere was so unwelcoming. I'm not asking for hand-holding, but I don't think it's unreasonable to request an environment where the professor isn't implicitly supporting a culture of ""who's best"" or ""who's worst"" or ""what's the grade distribution"" or ""who wants a professorially-sanctioned way to brag about how much they know about multithreading even though it's mostly irrelevant to this class."" Anyone who signs up for Kender's class and sticks with it has already demonstrated they deserve to be in 1007, even if they didn't get an A+ on homework 3 or couldn't work up the nerve to raise their hands that one time in lecture.
Take this class and ask a lot of questions; what you'll learn is worth it. But do your best to block out the competitiveness, and know the class is not representative of what CS culture should be.

I thought it was enough to leave it in the code). My main advice for that would be to ask a lot of questions on Piazza and to the TAs. Don't feel embarrassed for not knowing some things. After that first homework, the other homework assignments were challenging, but doable, especially if you sought help. 
The midterm was difficult, but fair if you paid attention in class and studied your notes (he'll say he might pull concepts from the textbook, but your notes are really all that matters). The final was a little harder but also fine.

DO NOT TAKE A CLASS WITH THIS PERSON. This class sounded incredible on paper, and the seminar format seemed like it would have made for a wonderful semester. This professor chose to lecture at the front of the room every class instead of engage her students in conversations about the course material. The class was about WOMEN DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKERS. It should have been amazing. I feel so disappointed by this class and the lack of clarity she instilled in me. She presented documentaries and film in general as something other than art. My love for the material was completed drained. She offers two assignments throughout the term and is unclear about what she asks for. She is a rough grader on material that is very subjective. She also regularly experienced unbelievable technical problems both with uploading the material she wanted us to engage with for each week's class and with the classroom's computer.

I took Calculus III last term with Dr. De Silva and she was amazing. She is incredibly kind and approachable during office hours, during class, and after class. When people had questions in class about a problem, she would patiently go through it. She was also incredibly organized: HWs were posted weeks before they were due, as were practice midterms/finals and solutions. She also stuck to the book fairly well. I also dealt with a sickness over the term and she was beyond generous and kind. I frankly do not have enough good things to say about her. 
The first midterm was quite easy because it consisted primarily of the cross product and dot product, so many people did well and stopped attending class. This led to a very low average for the second midterm. The final was about average difficulty. She has 90% problems that we've covered in class and HW, and 1 more tricky theory problem. Anything I didn't understand, I felt was my fault for not going to class/seeking out help - I really felt it was quite fair.
She also has an entertaining accent which I personally found amusing, but it might bother people, I don't know.

When I first found out I was placed in the American Studies session, I immediately attempted to switch because I have never had any interest in the subject. After countless hours of negotiation, I eventually failed and mentally prepared myself for the worst. What made me feel worse was that Ms. Schwerin seemed to be very strict and serious in the first class.
However, Ms. Schwerin turned out to be a fantastic teacher and made my UWriting experience a completely positive one. She lead class discussions incredibly well and always posed intellectually stimulating questions that really drove me to think deeply about the materials we read. Since she has a background in art, she incorporated art into the American Studies context, which significantly rendered the class more enjoyable. Sure some readings were rather dry, but time always passed by pretty quickly in class. Ms. Schwerin was also super patient and always made herself available whenever I had questions or needed revision advices. I remember one time I emailed her about a part in the reading that I didn't quite understand, and her response was literally like an essay; it not only clarified my original confusion, but also helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the text. At the end of the course, I definitely felt I became a better writer and actually for the first time started enjoying writing.

I have so much respect for Professor Mendelson that I feel wrong writing this review. A man of this much track record, the subsequent reviews, and natural charisma doesn’t need valuation. Just take his class, get an A, and leave a changed human.
Oh and one thing – Mendelson’s a natural savage. He doesn’t care about the little things. It’s the big things (how to be human; how to live life) that he’s interested in. Don’t waste your time brooding over whether he likes you as a person. He’s wiser than that – he’ll see through you. He only cares that you’re getting something out of this class – after all, a man of his success doesn’t need to be teaching freshmen. He’s there because he chose to be there. Just focus on what you can do as a student to best learn from the man. 
One caveat – that said, don’t take this class as a joke. I’m not saying it’s a tough class. It’s not. But it is going to be tough if you don’t enter the classroom with an open mind, ready to learn. Put in the effort but not that of brute force. Put your effort into answering the questions that genuinely interest you. If you’re the type that thinks you know all the answers to life, well you’re 18/19 my lad, it’s about time you get off your high horse.

I want to start by saying that she is a sweet professor, there is no doubt about that. She comes prepared and knows her stuff; however, if you are not already familiar with Western culture, then this class might not be for you. I don't want to sound critical, but she doesn't teach on an introductory level. She assumes that the whole class is on the same level, and ignores that half of Columbia students are international and don't necessarily know about Western art.
I am not a westerner, but i truly wanted to learn about the culture in an effort to better understand the people of Europeans decent, but i was not able to achieve that because i felt like i was in an advance class. Hence, if you have no background in Western music, then you might be better off going with another professor. Moreover, she is a harsh grader, she ruined my GPA.

I took this class as part of my major and because I was passionate about the subject, expecting to be able to sit through the class with blinders and just get this prof over with. I was wrong. This class had me considering changing my major because other upper-level classes I needed are only taught by this prof, and he is truly VERY bad. Lectures were quite boring and difficult to sit through, and he has the underwhelming tendency of being able to repeat himself five to six times per lecture, making it seem as he didnt bother to prepare much material. Most of the class didnt even show up, unless it was the final or midterm. The class is so basic that you can skip all of the lectures, not that I am advocating that practice, and still manage to get an A+. 
He is also VERY racially/culturally insensitive and allows students to be this way as well. On many occasions he has asked some Black Americans to speak about their culture, assuming they weren't from the US. He also has a very dangerous 'white savior' outlook to many human rights issues, implying that ""wealthy, western countries"" need to step in and coddle or heal poor, black and brown countries because they cannot do it themselves and we cannot expect them to make much progress by themselves.

Professor Luhan was by far one of the best professors that I had during my first year at Barnard. He drastically helped me improve my writing. I believe that this is important because all of the students who attend Barnard have a high standard for their writing skills, but Professir Luhan pushes his students to attain more. He does not expect students to have read every single reading every single day and will give students a few passes if they have fallen ill. He is excellent at stimulating discussions and coming up with new activities for classes. Even though I had to wake up at 8am to attend this class, I enjoyed doing so.

Worst professor ever. Do yourself a favour and just don't him. Just don't. He's a rambling piece of mess AND also has a shitty curve. The class is curved to a B-, so the majority of people I know, despite working their asses off, ended up with a B (which pulled down their GPA).

I think professor Wang is a great teacher. It might feel a bit intimidating at first to be in his class, but you can really tell that he wants every single student to do well. He is very strict with pronunciation, participation, and punctuality, but he has never been unfair about anything he's done. He is also very welcoming at his office hours and he encourages students to go there and ask him questions or talk about something they are struggling with. If you are very serious about learning chinese, I would definitely recommend you to take the class with him.

This class is THE BEST class I have ever taken at Columbia (I'm a rising senior now). If you are even considering this class TAKE IT. This man changed my life. Before taking this class, I exclusively drew anime and was not formally trained. I didn't know any basic art techniques like: Measuring, Shading, etc. However, that didn't matter, Edward took my anime skills and flipped them inside out. Showing me that classical drawing is accessible to anyone willing to try.
Edward's class is formidable but he equips you with all the skills necessary to succeed. He truly teaches from the ground up and doesn't make any assumptions about a student's abilities. He taught the entire class how to measure, analyze light, shading/sculpting a 3d object on a 2d plane. Perhaps what I loved the most about Edward's teaching was his references to animation. Edward was a classical 2d animator. So it's no surprise that he used this knowledge to make the complex topic of light/shade understandable. ""Abstract the shadows and look for animal shapes!"" Edward would say. He helped me find pizzas and dragons on my very serious cast drawing of Micheal Angelo's ""David's Eye"". 
Now onto Mr. Minoff himself. Edward is an extremely kind and unassuming man. His teaching style is individualized to each student. As he walked around the room, I could see different aspects of his personality at play. It was as if he adapted himself to address each student's personality and weaknesses. But what he impartially showed us all was a genuine belief that EVERYONE could accomplish the cast drawing successfully. There was no favoritism in his classroom (students' attempts at sucking up was awkwardly ignored). Also, if you want to learn more about art strike up a conversation with him!! I would ask him for tips/tricks for my other art class and he gladly helped me out. 
Finally be forewarned, Edward is a HONEST GRADER. He loves his craft dearly. This isn't a game to Edward, it is his livelihood and most importantly his passion. Do not sign up for this class thinking you can get an ""easy A"". You get what you deserve. So work hard and discover new artistic talents with Edward. He changed my life and I am forever grateful.

In the beginning there are small weekly assignments to help you hone the techniques shown in his drawing demos.

I took this course in the summer session and I will say, the last hour of that block can be rough as the material is a bit dense, especially if you don't have previous Anthropology knowledge. Professor Weisgrau is great though. I know some people in the class were a bit frustrated as she can seem a bit vague at times, but she's incredibly supportive and to be honest, quite a generous grader as well. I won't say it's an easy A, but if you try at all, she notices. She appreciates your interest and your ideas and I found it to be a very supportive environment. I tend to find the students who didn't like her, or didn't like her approach were the egos in the room who thought they were smarter than her.

Posnock might be one of the most polarizing professors in the department. People love him or hate him—and most people hate him. On the first day of Realism & Naturalism, there were about 30 students, many of whom literally pulled out their computers and dropped the course part way through the lecture. I think in total about 5 of us stuck it out for the semester, and I'm glad I did. He might be brusque and eccentric, but he's absurdly smart and quite funny. He's also very willing to meet with you outside of class to help you develop paper ideas or to answer any questions. He does have a very clear political point of view, so if you skew conservative be warned. The theme of the class also wasn't very clear, and I think on every handout he gave us he renamed the class. I think the most appropriate name for the class would be ""Novels Ross Posnock Likes."" In the end, his teaching style really grew on me and he presented interesting readings of a lot of classic novels. If you're on the fence, I highly recommend you give him a chance.

One piece of advice: GO TO CLASS!
Professor Kumar is one of those professors that you either really like, or really don't. I happened to love him, but note that this was not the case for everyone. The class is at 8:40, but every single person was always at class because Kumar hands out his personal notes, and if you are not in class, there is no other way to get them. 
With that being said, Professor Kumar definitely knows Thermodynamics, but it is a hard subject. You definitely need to go to office hours if you are even a little confused, because it will most definitely help and he definitely takes note. Kumar has this policy where he does not set strict office hours, but if you need help and he is in his office, he will help you. 
Also, his exams are really similar to the examples he does in class, and all exams are open book open notes.

I was really not looking forward to taking this class, as I've always dreaded art, but Julia did an absolutely amazing job at making me finally appreciate art! I took this during the summer so classes were 3 hours long, but she was really good at making time go by quickly. I gained knowledge in art that I think I might actually use in the future and also gained a ton of art analysis skills I never had before. Participation is VERY important, but Julia makes it a very low stress and chill environment. Previous reviews make her sound like she's a bit cocky/bitchy, but that really isn't true, i think she might just come off like that at first because she just knows so much. She also really cares about ALL of her students (one of her reviews says she is biased against guys. Speaking as a straight dude with a penis, I strongly disagree with that reviewer's comment). It's also a plus that she gives SUPER SHORT READINGS (like 5 pages per class MAX) and is a lenient grader—but maybe that's just cause I was taking her class during the summer. I'm a lazy premed science-oriented student, but this was easily one of my favorite classes taken at Columbia. If you can, switch to her class. Trust me. She deserves a gold nugget.
Workload:
Very light. Participation is a huge part of this class. Took this during the summer, so this probably isn't the same as a regular semester—2 page paper (I think she said that she gives an additional longer paper during regular semesters), midterm, and a very fun/low stress final project.

I loved Joe, but not everyone will. If you enjoy the reading and discussing the texts, this is the right professor for you. Joe has an unreal amount of knowledge about anything humanities related but especially classics (first semester). His insights into the texts are thought-provoking and give you a deeper understanding of why the text is important and considered to be so great. Plus, his New Zealand accent, his ridiculous fashion sense, and his frequent tangents make him extremely entertaining to listen to. His mind works at a million miles an hour and he's one of the most eccentric people I've ever met. He's also generally very casual, joking around with his students with a very dry, sarcastic sense of humor that he thinks we don't get/is unique to New Zealand.
That being said, he is not very forgiving to students who don't keep up with the reading or who are late to class, he gives lots of stupid/unhelpful assignments every night (I remember having to translate an ancient text into ""modern English""), and he is extremely moody. On a good day, he's the best professor you'll have all year, but on a bad day he is temperamental, seems disappointed in the class, or is just plain bored. Also, he requires you to go in and talk about your paper topic with him beforehand, and most of the time you do this he tears it to shreds and you leave feeling much worse. You will probably either love him or hate him, because there's not really an in between with him, but however you feel, I promise you'll have a more interesting professor than your friends!

He brought free coffee to every class. He gave away free books to whoever corrected his syllabus or slides, even if it's something minor like a date or just misspeaking. He took us on a field trip one class then bought us food and drinks afterwards.
Now that I have your attention, let me tell you about how amazing Bob and his class really is.
The course itself deals with various conflicts that the US military was involved in, but it's not a class that delves into the nitty-gritty strategy and tactics of wars. There is some of that, but the class deals with more general ideas and big picture things, as well as non-military aspect of the military (society, culture, politics, etc). This made the class more interesting for me, but not everyone is going to feel that way, I think, and that's fine.
It's a summer class, so it's going to be 3 hours long. Beginning of the class, you go over the previous class, if any good questions came up and he couldn't answer it right away. Then a rundown on the reading assigned before, then a break at this point. After that, class discussion on either questions Bob prepared or any questions the students might have had while reading that week's books.
The professor is what really makes the class shine, however. He's an easy-going and friendly guy who makes you feel comfortable to talk in class, which is super important as a significant portion of the class relies on discussions among peers. The discussions don't feel very forced, where everyone feels like they have to say something so they can get a grade, but it also doesn't devolve into a free-for-all shouting match. The fact that Bob can maintain that kind of balance in an especially contentious environment (like Columbia can be) and controversial topics (especially as we get to more modern wars) is a testament to his ability to lead the class.
One thing I would put against him is his penchant for mentioning how he started his own business and worked in media, and so on. He can come across as a bit pretentious when he does that.
He also literally wrote the book on napalm, so feel free to ask him about that.

Jay’s Game Theory course was intense but very rewarding. Beware of getting comfortable in this class. The first 3 weeks are fairly straightforward, as it takes some time to shift from the traditional OR mindset to a game theory mindset. However, homework quickly got complex and tough. 
The class is split into two parts. The first ¾ of the class is on game theory (which is split into 4 sections) and the last segment is on auction theory. While game theory is somewhat nuanced and difficult, Jay does a good job of elucidating the important concepts in class, and providing examples. The homework in this part of the class becomes tough because of the jump from the classroom examples to the homework. For example, in the classroom, we would find a Nash Equilibrium when each player has a finite number of options, whereas on homework, we were asked to do this when the players had unaccountably many options. He would give hints on how to do this, but you would really have to make sure you understood the concepts in the classroom example, and then use some different math to account for the jump from discrete to continuous. As usual, Jay is very dedicated in his office hours, as is his TA Irene, and that means there was plenty of help. Jay also records his lectures which is very helpful when tackling homework. It is important to look at the homework as soon as it is released, as you will need time to ponder the problems, get stuck, etc. The problem sets were definitely hard and long but if you work your way through them you really understand the material, and you are ready to tackle his notoriously difficult exams, which are similar in style to his other courses. 
The auction theory portion of the class was rough. Jay was sometimes unprepared, and the material is significantly more confusing than game theory. The combination led to a large amount of confusion. When you combine this with the fact that some differential equations got thrown in, people were quite disheartened. Jay is planning on re-doing this portion of the course based on the experience with our class, but whenever you get to auction theory, make sure to strap yourself in, because there are lots of things to wrap your head around, and the provided textbook isn’t the most useful, though it is nice to use on occasion. 
Ignoring the auction theory part of the course, the class was difficult, yet interesting, challenging, and illuminating. It is also extremely useful because it forces you to approach problems in a way that differs greatly from the traditional OR mindset, and that in and of itself is extremely useful and much more applicable from a job point of view. The class average is generally quite terrible as seniors don’t like to show up to a Monday morning class, so that helps in terms of grading.

I think Biliris is a fairly strong professor and, given that it was a 2.5 hour class, I enjoyed it as much as I possibly could. As with all professors he has his pros and cons.
Biliris is a ball or energy and a personality in the classroom and undeniably cares about his students. He responds to questions on Piazza fairly quickly, made a point to get to know people in the class. He even joked that we could call him if going through a breakup. 
He is very energetic and enthusiastic about the material and the examples, and he tends to be good at making things quite simple, so the combination is good. He also continually involves students of the classroom. He will ask for suggestions on how to solve something, ask someone else to point out flaws, etc. This keeps the room fairly engaged for a class that is 2.5 hrs long. 
Biliris welcomes student questions in lectures and will always stop to answer a question before moving on. This both a pro and a con. Sometimes I feel like the class got stuck because we would keep harping on an issue that was either not extremely relevant or simply repetitive. However, the good news is that, if you are willing to raise your hand, you will always walk out of class knowing what is going on. Unfortunately, Biliris sometimes either struggles to understand a student question or misinterprets the question. As such, you have to be persistent with rephrasing till he understands the question, at which point he usually does a solid job of answering.
The workload is quite light. There are 4 light homework assisgnments, two projects, a midterm and a final. The first project is significantly more in depth than the second, but the time allocated for the projects reflects that. The midterm is exactly the same in structure as the practice midterm, which makes it easy to study for. No practice final is given, and the material was harder and more technical, so make sure to spend time on Query Optimization when studying for the final. 
His grading tends to be fairly generous in my view, and I think the level of CS ability in this class is lower than most other CS classes, since it is required for OR undergrads and many masters students seemed to come from weak data structures backgrounds (we spent 30 minutes discussing the complexity of a hash table). Overall, assuming you go to class and pay attention, this is a low workload class apart from projects and exams.

This class was not particularly hard or interesting. The Professor generally lectures straight from the textbook so you are welcome to just read the textbook if you don’t want to go to class. The problems in this class are fairly algorithmic; you usually just have to identify the type of differential equation and then use the provided technique to spit out the answer. The examples in class are usually useful to see how one should think about the problems, so I would recommend going to class over reading the textbook.
The answers to all the homework problems are in the back of the book which makes the homework average very high. The issue is that Panagiota is not always aware of what she put on the homework, so there might be problems from a section that was not explicitly covered in class, in which case you simply have to learn another formula and apply it to the required problems. Her exams are not particularly difficult, though there was one question from left field on both her first midterm and the final. 
Overall, this is a fairly straightforward class with a decent textbook and an alright teacher, but don’t expect much from her in terms of email or office hours.

This class was easily one of my favorite classes I have taken at Columbia. As an undergrad who is not in the statistics department, I sometimes had to play some catch up on some of the statistical background, but it was totally worth it.
Cunningham is, in my view, the ideal Columbia professor. He expects a lot of his students, he won’t be easy on you, he doesn’t put up with student bullshit (turning in homework late, cheating on exams, etc.), but is extremely good at teaching the material, and always happy to answer questions. He is also insanely hot. 
The pace of the class is heavily dictated by students asking questions to slow him down. For the first 3 weeks or so, people wouldn’t raise their hands when Cunningham stopped for questions, so he would move on assuming we were ready to go. Once people got comfortable asking questions in a large classroom, the pace slowed, he reviewed stuff that people were confused about, and things hit their stride. He is extremely good at explaining the concepts of the various algorithms through examples, diagrams, demonstrations, etc. As such, one walks away with a very good understanding of what the pros and cons of various algorithms are. His slides are quite detailed, and if you take the time to understand everything on there you will be golden. He supplements the slides with hand written examples and notes when necessary. This isn’t a proof based class but you definitely need to be capable in linear algebra and basic statistics to do some of the math with the algorithms provided. HW 0 should be a good indicator of whether you have the appropriate math background or not. 
If you are an undergrad in this class, you will have to take some time to tackle the material outside of class. He tries to scare you on the first day of class, but if you’re willing to put in some work for this class, don’t let it deter. Cunningham covers a LOT of material, and in a decent amount of depth, so I would usually walk out of the classroom overloaded, but after going back through the slides and thinking through things, I was generally good to go, and this process resulted in me getting a very high grade in a mostly graduate class.
The way he phrases the key takeaways of each algorithm are a godsend so if you just right those down in class, that will help you work through things on your own. His exams are fairly conceptual, with one problem involving an in-depth mathematical derivation. In our case, he made the midterm a bit too long (which he told us before we started), but overall the class performance was lower than I expected, so I think the grading was quite fair. Cunningham does his best to emphasize the learning in the classroom rather than the grades, and his bravado combined with his young age makes for a really awesome and energetic classroom environment.
On a slight tangent, it is also nice to see a teacher who is willing to call out a student for opening an exam early, as stuff like that seems go unnoticed for many professors here.
Overall this an interesting course, covering a lot of material, with useful assignments, taught by a great professor. If you want an easy class, look somewhere else, but if you want to learn a lot and really understand the material, then sign yourself up.

Cliff’s class was overall a solid, low workload course. While I don’t find Production Scheduling an inherently exciting topic, I think Cliff did a good job of trying to keep everyone engaged.
Throughout the class you simply look at different scenarios and consider the best ways to schedule things to meet certain objectives. The provided textbook is quite awful, and Cliff’s slides are quite bare, so you will definitely want to go to class.He mostly uses the white board in class, and uses the slides just to remind himself of the example he is about to work through. That being said, he is good at providing the intuition of how to approach the various problems, and is surprisingly good at providing a silly metaphor to help you think through the logic (e.g: “if we are running a race, and you are both faster and start closer to the finish line, it is obvious who will win”). 
He is also very aware that this class in in senior spring for most students, so he spent some time talking about job stuff, Columbia’s basketball team, etc. 
His exams aren’t super difficult, but they also are not boringly algorithmic. He isn’t just going to give you a type of problem you have seen and ask you to apply the algorithm found in class. That might be part of the problem but then he might modify an assumption or ask a more conceptual question, so you will have to synthesize learning from other algorithms to make a slight modification to the one at hand. This shouldn’t be difficult or shocking for anyone, but I guess it is slightly annoying for those in senior spring who would rather just chill out. 
He has 1 homework set a week that is not particularly difficult, and usually taken less than 3 hours to do, if not less. There is a final project for this class but you define the scope of it, so to some extent, it is as much work as you want it to be, subject to limitations of course. Overall this is a somewhat boring topic, presented in a clear way, by a good professor with a low workload.

I don't have too much to add to Xi's previous reviews, but I did want to emphasize that this course really is very tough. Xi is a pretty good lecturer, and a very nice guy, but do be prepared to spend a ton of time on the problem sets.
We had 4 or 5 problem sets throughout the semester. All of them very heavy proof-based. They easily took me 20+ hours each. There were some really smart people taking this class so maybe it took them less time, but the problem sets are no joke.
The midterm was pretty easy compared to the problem sets. The final was not; it was basically like the problem sets except you couldn't spend a whole week on it and going to OHs.
Overall a solid class, but don't think this is CS Theory part 2. It's more like CS Theory on steroids.

Absolutely take this class! Although it starts out not too exciting, it is definitely worth it. Professor Pious is a relatively dry lecturer and the lectures are fast paced and filled with facts and require very fast and focused note taking as he reads from papers at the front of the class. Class rules are somewhat strict (no lateness, food, etc) and absences are not really tolerated. However, by the end of the semester, I was so glad I had taken the class. Pious conveyed massive amounts of really important information very well and in a way that was easy to understand. His lectures were without bias and based on facts and his huge wealth of knowledge on the topic. If you pay attention, the lectures are very interesting and very rewarding. The class grade is determined by three research papers. Although they seem daunting, he is wonderful in office hours and really happy to help. I ended up learning a huge amount from the paper writing experience as well. If you have any interest in environmental policy or politics or just politics in general definitely take this class, Pious is super smart and helpful and also low key very funny.

Professor Moody- Adams is an incredible woman who knows literally everything. i took her philosophy of law class in the fall and her ethics class in the spring and both were great choices. Moody is an incredibly organized professor, and the readings she assigns are never too long or useless. she covers the reading in class and posts her power points on courseworks. i still think its incredibly worthwhile to go to lecture though because she further elaborates on the major themes of the reading, and engages the class in discussion. by the end of both semesters i left feeling like i had a new perspective on what law is and what ethics means to me.

There are already a ton of comments talking about how difficult this class is, so i'm not going to waste your time repeating that. Instead, if you are reading this, you probably were assigned to a class you cannot change. But there is hope! I got an A in this class and so can you. Here's how: 
1. REREAD THE TEXT. You will hear this phrase repeated ad nauseam in her classroom, but it really is one of the best ways to succeed. If you are reading a book that you aren't going to write a paper on (majority of the books), then skimming the text is fine. You can probably even get away with skipping a reading or two, although I wouldn't recommend it. Reading every text allows you to contribute to her in-class writing activities, which are sort of like ungraded pop quizzes (will elaborate below). However, if you are writing a paper on a book, you need to read it at least twice; once with the class, and once independently when you are writing the paper. You need to know this text EXTREMELY well to succeed- any slight mischaracterization or misinterpretation will cost you greatly in the paper. 
2. Do EVERY extra credit opportunity: As mentioned above, Fleischer without warning asks students to complete in-class writing activities, for which you will receive a grade of a check minus, check, or check plus. Every check plus equals extra credit. She will read out loud the best one or two responses in these activities, and if that happens to you a couple of times, you WILL see an increase in your grade at the end of the semester. In order to be successful at these, DO ALL READINGS. In addition, complete peer review throughly and as often as possible. 
3. Class participation is about depth not breath: Yes, it is important to contribute to discussion regularly in her class, but she will appreciate 1-2 thoughtful and unique comments much more than you giving 10 comments that consist of your opinion or are just extending another classmate's comments (unfortunately, I saw many people try the second strategy). Also, as the year goes on, whenever you can make a connection to a previous text or supplement essay, DO SO. 
4. GO TO OFFICE HOURS: Her first draft comments consist largely of pointing out grammar errors and expressing general dissatisfaction with your writing. Office hours will give you an opportunity to actually hear what she has to say about your writing. Whatever suggestions she makes, DO THEM, even if you don't agree. 
5. GO TO THE WRITING CENTER: As many times as humanly possible! Not only will this improve the quality of your writing (seriously, it will), it also will impress Fleischer- when you turn in your drafts, she asks you to include drafts you gave to a writing fellow. This shows her that you are making an extra effort to improve your writing and she will reward you for that. 
6. Do not give up!: I received a b- on one of the 3 papers and still finished with an A due to her generous grade adjustment from extra credit and class participation. Many students do very poorly on the first test and then resign themselves to a low grade, and don't put in much effort. This is very obvious to Fleischer and it will make her dislike you. Instead, if you get a bad grade on your first paper (most people do), go to office hours as soon as possible to discuss with her your grade. Do NOT attempt to argue for a better score or express disagreement with the text; only ask for ways in which you can improve. 
GOOD LUCK!!!

If reading/writing is your forte but mathematics is not, this is the Economics elective for you: it's arguably the most math-light course I've ever taken en route to my Econ major. There were a couple very simple formulas covered in class, but none of them were actually required knowledge for any assignments; they were simply used to illustrate concepts.
This course was honestly more akin to a literature course than an Economics course, focusing on critical analysis of foundational economic texts (Wealth of Nations, Das Kapital, etc). If you've read those texts in another literature or philosophy class before--like Contemporary Civilization, for those Columbia College students like myself--this course will seem mostly like a repetition.
Prof. Burgstaller is exceedingly friendly and accommodating; recordings of each lecture along with his personal lecture summaries and even pictures of the blackboard are posted on courseworks for every single lecture, so if you miss a day (or two, or nearly all of them), you can still follow along with the class on your own time. He can occasionally ramble or veer off into unrelated (if humorous) tangents, but in general his lectures are informative and insightful if you keep up.
Overall, if you generally get good grades in your writing/literature courses, this course will likely feel very easy, and you can secure a good grade with minimal challenge. All three major assignments (90% of the course) are writing-based, with the remaining 10% based on ""participation,"" a category loose enough that you can stay pretty much silent, or even skip your presentation, and still get an A- in the course with high enough grades on your other assignments.
tl;dr Are you a good reader/writer? Do you regularly get good grades on essays? This course is a cakewalk. Are you more into formulas and computation? You'll find practically none of it here.

Jervis is obviously smart and can be quippy but this was the worst class I've ever taken. The first day there were 300 people in the lecture and after one hour long period with his lecturing style, only about 10 people were showing up regularly- that is not an exaggeration. I try to go to class but everyone had a shared understanding that you were never going to learn anything in lecture. He is so quiet and just goes on these long tangents without any rhyme or reason and you don't learn really anything. He is such a sweet old man but his strength is not in lecturing. I would NOT recommend this class to anyone.

The subject matter in this class is incredibly interesting, however, the execution is quite poor. The course consists of reading an OR research paper for each class. The research topics are pretty cool, like apportionment, OR in homeland security, hospital ER rooms, etc. The class is broken down into groups, and each lecture, one group will teach the whole class by summarizing and explaining the findings of a paper. Students not presenting are supposed to have read the papers ahead of time, but since it's not enforced, typically nobody reads the papers and nobody pays attention to the lecture either. Jay did lecture the first few classes, which were probably the best classes of the semester and people actually paid attention to. 
I personally was part of the 10% of the class that actually read papers ahead of time and paid attention during lectures so I felt that I got something out of the class. However, the other 90% of people simply were on their phones the entire class (if they even chose to show up). It's quite disheartening to look around and see pretty much no one paying attention in class. I think Jay is restructuring the class soon (hopefully). Overall, very easy class with potential to be very interesting. You get out of it what you put in. Please don't be part of the majority of people who are disrespectful and pay zero attention in class.

Prof. Rosen is a godsend. The previous reviewers described her very well, so I won't go into detail, but had to add that you MUST take her class. You will learn a ton both about the texts and about your own writing. She should have a gold nugget.
Don't be scared by her grading on papers. My theory is that she has some sort of secret curve/bonus where everyone's finals are ""really really well done"" (you don't get them back or to see the grade even if you ask) allowing her to bump up everyone's grade at the end of the semester. She doesn't want to penalize good, thoughtful students for a dud paper, so she will probably make it up to you in this way. Combined with generous allotments for participation and Google Docs, Prof. Rosen allows for many opportunities for redemption (or if not redemption, bonus points). At least half the class will get in the A-range according to my transcript. 
My main advice is to participate well (she called me out on not talking enough in office hours, although she doesn't spot call) and take her comments about close reading and extrapolating features of the text as a whole from words/phrases in the the passages very seriously on exams and essays. My exams literally looked like this: ""quote of 1-4 words in the passage"" --> feature of the text (e.g. rhyme scheme, narrative discrepancies, teleology): brief note form explanation. Make a list of features of each text and memorize it so that you can do this easily during test and you'll have no problem. 
TL;DR: MARGO IS THE BEST. She will challenge you to do good work and teach you a lot about the texts and how to write. Her grading is very fair. She is warm, understanding, and very smart. If you're in her class, you've lucked out. 
Workload:
Very fair. The Google Docs assignments shouldn't take more than 15 minutes (I did them in between my previous class and the start of her class each day for the entire year and was fine). By making her essays passage analysis she takes away a lot of guesswork and saves you time. As noted, the midterm and final include fewer IDs. She literally changes the department wide exam to be more appropriate to our class, including substituting passages. No quizzes.

Really unfair course. Lecture is purely powerpoints. HW is radically different from lecture. You have to utilize the textbook in order to have ANY idea what the hw is about, and even then I only managed to figure it out from people who went to her office hours and asked what the hell is going on. She has office hours for undergrads and encourages you to go, simply because if you don't go you will never figure out the homework. Its a good thing that she posts hw solutions because that is how you learn from the class. Essentially, you learn after you flunk your hw grade.
Exams are 50% fair 50% impossible. This course is graded using a gaussian without a curve. BEST part about this course; you will find no material/help online since it is such a niche subject. You have been warned.

I loved this class. Learning about the English literary tradition seemed essential for me as a writer (and erstwhile, aspiring academic), but I was worried it might be a little dull. Fortunately, Professor Crane really breathed life into the lectures and and thoroughly immersed us in the material. I ended up finding myself incredibly moved by the texts as a result. Moreover, her Steven Pinker-like grasp of style/grammar was invaluable for--I'm almost certain--everyone. She would address common mistakes made in papers and it was clear that she was filling in gaps that had obviously been neglected by countless professors/courses... Anyone with even the most remote interest in English literature HAS to take this class. And anyone who wants to further develop their academic writing would do well to take ANY class offered by her.

This class was a great experience!  Professor Crane was engaging and clearly interested in the subject matter, which was itself also quite interesting.  There was a nice balance of in-class discussion and lecture.  Professor Crane was always very attentive to students and receptive of their comments.  The additional activites, such  as manuscript reading, Middle English practice, and the trip to the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library, were also very engaging and connected well to the subject matter.  She gave great feedback and comments on the papers as well.  Really enjoyed it!

I really enjoyed this class. I found Professor Crane to be a dynamic lecturer, who impressively related much of what we were reading to contemporary thinkers like Foucault. I found her to be deeply caring toward her students and also the subject matter. She was a professor who actually wanted her students to succeed in her class, and most importantly put the work in herself to make that happen. For all the essays she had an excellent system for students to turn in the paper on a reasonable time schedule that worked for them, and was very active in helping students meet with her on their topics. 
Not only that, she was always clear in her expectations for the papers, and they were always fair and fun. Furthermore, in class she encouraged lots of participation, and was incredibly thoughtful in her responses to students. She be clear when someone was misguided, but kindly corrected the student and even found ideas/logics within their comments to rift on. She was the opposite of a typically cocky, ""expert"" professor, and even though she had more historic context on the era, always guided us with the goal not of forcing her extensive knowledge on us, but sharing and helping the class come to a consensus. A joy!

I took this class because I think that a basic knowledge in art history is an important aspect of functioning as an intellectual person. That said, this class gave me nothing. I went to class a few times in the beginning of the semester but stopped showing up shortly thereafter. The class was boring with most students mindlessly writing down every word Higonnet said (which was seemed thoughtless to me). There was nothing about the class that was at all worth showing up for. It was not at all stimulating and seemed to be a complete waste of time. If you want a class where you can spend an hour and 15 minutes hearing Higonnet speak in flowery, insubstantial, repetitive phrases...go for it. I wouldn't exactly recommend wasting your tuition money on that.
The class wasn't all bad though. The artworks chosen were interesting and that made it fun studying for the midterm and final. It's a 4 credit class that is an easy A so that's also nice if you need a GPA boost.My TA also happened to be incredible and she made the class 10000000% more thought provoking as did the museum trips.

Prepare yourself. Trevor's class will be hard. As in, when you compare your UW assignments to your friend's, you will realize that yours require more work and writing. He's a tough teacher and will push your writing very far. The workload is tough and time consuming and not really in line with a 3 credits course load. Trevor's class will feel like 4 credits. That being said, I love Trevor. His class is my favorite taken thus far at Columbia. He's an amazing teacher and is incredibly invested in improving every single person's writing. Class discussions are really good (be sure to participate!), and the small size of the class will make you feel close to everyone in no time at all. Trevor is a strong proponent of peer review and one-on-one sessions (two are required). You work in depth with your classmates and learn so much. Thankfully, everyone is pretty interested in the focus of gender and sexuality. The readings are great, but do require multiple rereads. I would note that Trevor's class is a little different from other specialized sections in that he prioritizes writing and improving everyone's writing ability over learning about gender and sexuality. However, I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm such a more confident writer now because of this class. In short, his class is pretty difficult and will require lots of work, but your writing will be elevated to such a great extent! For transparency's sake, I received a B+. My friends who had previously taken UW said my essays would have been more of an A- level in their classes, but that's okay with me. If you end up with Trevor, keep him! He's funny and endearing and a little awkward and will terrify everyone the first day with the textbook length syllabus and policy about coming to class late, but it was such a rewarding experience. He also does this great thing where he will edit your progressions via video, so you can understand ""his experience as a reader"". His feedback is invaluable; if you try to follow most of his advice you'll do just fine. 
Workload:
Typical UW workload and then some (P1, P2, P3, P4). Your P4 doesn't have to be about gender/sexuality. Two mandatory one-on-one sessions with Trevor. Multiple exercises per each progression that are lengthy but make you think critically about your writing style and skills.

I love Liza! She's a gem. Sweet, considerate, helpful, you really can't ask for a better Lit Hum professor. She has this endearing quirk where she will only address people in class by their last name (ex: Mr. X, Ms. X, Mx. X). You'll get into this habit too and might end up not knowing everyone's first names by the end of the year. Liza is a part of the Slavic Studies Department, so we ended up reading Tolstoy (""Sevastopol Tales"", ""Childhood, Boyhood, Youth"") instead of Paradise Lost. She really loves Slavic literature. Also, drawing. Her class usually follows the typical (and dull) Lit Hum lecture model, but she will occasionally break it up by having students get up and draw scenes from the books on the chalkboards. There are a few class debates as well (Was Odysseus a good leader? Should Pride & Prejudice be on the syllabus?, etc.), along with some presentations to the class. Like any Lit Hum class, you probably will not end up doing every single reading and that is okay. As long as you skim and remember some key points, you'll get by. However, Liza does love to call upon students who have not raised their hands and may ask some pretty specific questions. If you don't know, it's not that big of a deal because she'll either call upon someone else, answer it herself, or get distracted completely and never address it. Her lectures aren't always that structured, and she is unintentionally hilarious. Sometimes she will get so overwhelmed by emotion after we read something that she might start crying in the middle of class. Cherish her. She really does care, and usually sets up conferences for essays. She can be pretty helpful, though I never really learned how to improve my grade over the course of the year and consistently scored a ""B+/A-"" on every essay. Her tests are incredibly different from your peers (read: better). IDs don't matter as she'll usually give the speaker in the middle of a quote or use the first lines of the book. Expect many short essays on the other hand and ""scavenger hunts"" where you'll have to compare three works and unusual essays asking you to write an Op-Ed or defend a character's actions. You generally have to post on CourseWorks after every reading, but she only asks for one or two sentences per post. Participation does help, so make an effort to talk in class. Her class can be strange and assignments creative, but Liza really cares deeply about Lit Hum, and eventually, you will want to as well.
Workload:
Definitely doable. Readings can get pretty heavy (learn how to skim, if you use SparkNotes use it wisely). Frequent posts on Courseworks. Three essays per semester, but they're short (three pages-ish). Midterm and Final follow similar formats: some quick IDs that focus on meaning rather than where it is from, a ""scavenger hunt"" comparing symbols/ideas/motifs between works, and two creative essays.

Taking Professor Lilla's class for Lithum was the best decision I made as a freshman. Lithum lives or dies with your professor, and few teachers are more qualified than Lilla to teach the western classics. Even a cursory perusal of any of his books or articles for the New York Review of Books reveals his astounding facility with western literature and philosophy. Lilla's method of teaching Lithum is ""old school."" In class Lilla's focus was primarily on uncovering and discussing the ""timeless philosophical themes"" of the texts we read, and little time was spent doing textual or literary analysis. If you are interested in discussing the iniquity of a curriculum composed of ""dead white males"" then Lilla is certainly not the professor for you. Lilla has little patience for contemporary notions of political correctness, though he never discounts the opinions of his students. More than anything Lilla strives to stimulate debate in class and would often challenge students to motivate their arguments or ideological presuppositions. Besides being supremely knowledgeable, Lilla was a remarkably caring teacher as well. He arranged for every student to meet with him personally during office hours solely in order to get to know his students better beyond the classroom.

Totally agree with the below review. I tried so hard for the class and clearly I didn't get an A. Why? Because she just doesn't give As. I approached her multiple times of the course of the semester, asking for more feedback and ways to improve and she said - hey, you are doing so fine!!! B+ is a great grade. LOL WHAT. Not in Art Hum. I have friends totally cruising through other sections of Art Hum and getting A/A+s. I put in so much work, always spoke multiple times in class, and she did say I'm a very good student but..... B+.

Solid Music Hum section. Professor Goodheart does a great job of balancing discussion of formal structures in music with emotional, personal responses to it. He's also great at keeping the class interesting and responding to student questions and ideas. 
Not a huge amount of historical context is covered, until you get to the 20th century when he does discuss more of it. 
Still, I felt like I left the class with a stronger ability to listen to all kinds of music and appreciate pieces even when I may not like them.

Even though I am not an English major, this has so far been my favorite course at Columbia. I love medieval literature and culture and took this as a general education requirement for Barnard. Professor Crane was very kind and obviously loves the subject, and the readings she assigns are all interesting and relatively short, and if anything is unclear she will gladly provide answers in class, through email, or during office hours. She encourages participation in class but this can be in the form of questions about the readings or general comments or opinions. The texts are probably only compelling for fans of medieval art (we read Beowulf, King Arthur, etc.), but it is a great English class and Professor Crane is excellent.

I've never had such a hard time with a professor. She assigns hours of reading and homework a night and cuts no breaks. Assigns what's called ""pre-homework"" to go with reading that is based on completion. The only problem is that to complete the pre-homework, you have to fully comprehend what you just read. Why are we paying thousands of dollars for professors if we have to self-teach the material?

Please please please as a recent graduate I beg you to take a class with this man. He was one of the best parts about my Columbia University education. He tells a story through history, he makes classes tangible and interactive, he will engage you and make you feel like you are part of the past. If you have any love for history at all, Mark Carnes is the professor for you. I had the fortune of taking Reacting to the Past with him my freshman year, a course that has made him famous academically across the world. It is a course that exercises intellectual history, teamwork, public speaking, debate, research and writing all in one-- a game of history, if you will. You embody a character and you become that character for that ""game"" whether it takes place at the trial of Socrates or the Succession Crisis of the Wan-Li empire. Essentially, you are taught history by becoming history. You are taught to speak and talk through the eyes of others, all while bonding with your classmates. The US 1940-1975 class was a different style of class-- not small seminar but huge lecture. Nevertheless, Carnes riveted us all. The textbook was phenomenal (it made me cry while describing JFK's death and the repercussions that his death had on society) and most of all Carnes was just able to engage the room. I have never been in a lecture where everyone is absolutely engaged. In Carnes's class, people listened to him because he made history not about the past, but about why the past was important for the present and future and how we got to this point in the world. I cannot stress it enough-- take a class with Carnes. If you put in the work and the effort, you'll get an A. Don't take this class if you're looking for an easy class. Take his classes if you're looking for your tuition money to give you an experience that you'll take with you the rest of your life.

As the name implies, it is very intense. Starting out we had 30 lines the first day and by the end of the first week, we were doing between 50 and 60 a day. At the end of the six weeks, we were up to about 70 line per day. She is an amazing teacher who honestly cares and will take the time if you ask her. Honestly, this is the best way to complete your language requirement for Columbia. It is six weeks, you don't read it as much as you would in the full year-long course, and it's pretty fun. However, if you are a classics student or a classical studies student, I would not recommend this. For me, you were going so fast and translating so much that you didn't have time to make your translations all they could be to further your understanding of the Latin language. It was hard to gain vocabulary because you rushed through everything and didn't have time to build up your vocabulary for the 3000 level follow-on courses you need to take after. In short: Great teacher, very intense, everybody got A's, great way to fulfill your language requirement, but not if you're a classics student.

Methods of Social Research is an easy class. But, Jacob Boersema turned out to be one of the most unorganized, and quite frankly most unprofessional professor I have ever dealt with at Columbia. I don't think there was one lecture that he wasn't late to, and the way he organized the workload didn't make any sense. The class is interesting and explores exactly what the title of the course is-- The Methods of Social Research. Professor Boersema basically uses the class as a means for conducting his own research. The workload is a series of projects in which you are observing and researching the gentrification of Harlem. (This may change every year depending on his own agenda) The projects were easy, but also very time consuming. You are split up into groups for most of them which makes it a little bit easier. The main reason I am writing this review is to warn those who take the course, that Professor Boersema lacks communication skills and organization. In several instances, he would change Syllabus policies, due dates, etc. and forget what he said, rebuke his claim and would get frustrated with the entire class. One of his projects was to conduct a 45 minute to an hour interview with a Harlem shop owner, with a weeks notice before the due date, and we were to record it, transcribe it and write a paper on it. It was rather unrealistic because small business owners don't have time to do that. In lecture nearly 80 of us discussed the problem with JB that no one could even get an interview lined up in the timeframe and he became frustrated with the class, and the students became frustrated with him. Long story short people ended up turning in the project up to two to three weeks after it was assigned and it was a scattered mess. I also had an experience of one of my take home final getting lost somehow after turning it in to the dropbox, and I was notified by Jacob a week after school ended. He made it sound like I was in jeopardy of failing, even though I explained that I dropped it off, and that he could see that the final was turned in electronically on time in courseworks. He was just plain rude about the mishap even though it was totally out of my control. After him ignoring my final emails leaving me guessing whether i would fail, I ended up fine. He also tried to send two of my group members to judicial affairs for plagiarism on a take home final that was based off of our experience in the class that consisted mainly of group research (of course their answers are going to be similar) they both were ignored and left to wonder if they were going to fail the class but ended up getting A's. 
I would say take the class to get an easy A, but be careful of Jacob Boersema and try to over communicate so there is no grey area where you can get screwed over. (But do it in person because he doesn't like to respond to emails from his undergrad research slaves)

Jutta is the love of my life. As a foreign language learner, who has had his fair share of foreign language teachers, she is by far the best I have ever had. She is not only incredibly knowledgeable about German, but is amazing at teaching you it. She does not correct every mistake you make in order to foster a desire to speak, while making sure you are remembering key grammar points. She has convinced me to seek a concentration in German. She prepares you very well for all of the tests and is a generous grader.

Took lit hum with Prof baker in fall 2015 and Spring 2016. 
I came in this class so out of place. Having not done much literature in highschool( am an international student), I was way behind my peers in regards of writing and literary skills. I remember shooting an email to him before even 1st class making him aware of where i stood. He worked with me and encouraged me to speak up and try. Started with a not really great first paper and ended up being the author of one of the best papers later in the course (his words). All due to guidance, encouragement and wisdom from Prof steve.
He is a very fair grader and you would never feel he wants to deduct points. He will be on your side, ""always""(shameless Snape plug). In the class discussions he loves to listen to students discuss but has a plan for every class himself. You would never feel singles out but also could speak up your mind.
I was very shy at the start but my confidence constantly grew under his supervision. Outside the class too he's one of the most genuine people I met at columbia. I would even go on to say a rare kid breed on this cut throat campus. He would listen to you enthusiastically in Office hours and could even help you plan out your full papers with him. He is a very unique sense of humor that keep class from being a bore but also not go off the hinges.
His exams are beautifully made and biggest pro of all , you can take on any idea and interpret it in your own way. There is no set mind map that he expects. I wrote papers exploring topics that hit me deeply and brought in current times as well as dark stuff at times and he appreciated it instead of criticizing.
Any first year that got assigned to prof Baker is very lucky. In no time it will be the day of final and you will feel sad as you hand him your final exam and say Goodbye to one of the kindest people you will ever meet who will look at you like he sees potential in you.

The other reviews were solid but let me break it down for you. Maude is a boss. No other words. She probably loves her class more than her own family which makes it impossible not to care about the readings and workload. That being said, the workload was ridiculously standard and Maude was soooo understanding about any issue. I swear Maude Meisel might be God because she taught us that God created the world in 7 days and Maude blew my mind in 7 minutes.

Alla Smyslova is one of the best professors, and likely the best language professor, that I have had at Columbia. Alla Aleksandrovna uses a distinct teaching style: it is highly methodological, students constantly are engaged in small- or large-group discussion, and she provides comprehensive feedback targeted to each individual student. Expect her to quickly see and recognize your strengths and weaknesses. Although this may seem intimidating, it is not. She is always there to help students with problems they have with the Russian language. The class is high-energy and engaging as a result of her enthusiasm.
The material of Alla Aleksandrovna’s Third-Year Russian course does follow along with parts of the textbook, but she often goes into greater depth than the textbook and more often than not utilizes her own exercises rather than those in the book. In this sense, the course and its materials are obviously designed by her, while the textbook is simply a supplement. Although you will read a lot and write a lot, in my opinion the greatest strength of the course is the emphasis placed on speaking. Perhaps the quantity of new vocabulary terms will be less than in first- and second-year Russian, but the depth of understanding of the lexical topics covered (including vocabulary and phrase retention) and, especially, the grammar is greater. If you had problems with topics like motion verbs and verb aspects, expect to be able to understand them more clearly through the methodology introduced in this course.
The efficacy of Alla Aleksandrovna’s course is dependent on the students too. Students who are motivated and do the assignments (which often include speaking to yourself) will experience great improvement in the language, while those who do not follow her suggestions will not. So, I recommend only taking this course if you genuinely wish to improve your Russian skills and are willing to put in the effort to do so. Under Alla Aleksandrovna’s teaching ideology, a large part of becoming comfortable in a language stems from practice. She refers to this as “мускульная память” (muscle memory), and therefore treats language like any other sport or musical instrument. Class time is not enough to effectuate this, so plan to practice outside of class if you wish to really improve.
The class overall is not easy, and you may be frustrated at times, but it is very rewarding. For me, declensions, motion verbs, and other linguistic characteristics of Russian are no longer something I get confused over. If you put in the effort you can expect positive results.
Workload:
The workload is moderate to heavy, but largely dependent on you. Often, Alla Aleksandrovna’s assignments (which are always clearly written out part by part) include things like speaking practice, that are easy to skip over. However, if you wish to improve your Russian, doing the entirety of the assignments is a necessity. Per class (3 times per week), expect to work for 1-2 hours outside of class. Each assignment has times written on it, so you won’t face any surprises time-wise. Alla encourages spending the whole recommended time: if the assignment takes less time, use the rest of the 1-2 hours to practice speaking or other things.

Isabella was a wonderful TA for Intro Art History I with Anne Higonnet, and one of the reasons I decided to minor in Art History. I got into her section last minute and I feel so grateful that I did. She's smart, competent, engaging, and made section something I looked forward to every week. That class can be unbearable if you have a bad TA - they grade all your papers/tests, you interact more with them than with Higonnet -  but I lucked out. She cares about the students and is invested in their success throughout the course. I managed to make some of my required trips to the Met with her as well, and her tours were actually interesting (a feat for those trips). She met with me to discuss my papers any time I wanted/needed to, and her comments actually made me think and definitely improved my writing. If you get the chance to have her as your TA, go for it!

Many reviews of Professor Kaye here are shocking given my incredibly positive experiences in two of his classes. His enthusiasm for the subject matter and expertise make his lectures really captivating, even for students who have no prior knowledge of the middle ages.

This class sparked my interest in the middle ages, and I promise you will not regret taking it. Do not listen to people who say this class is boring!!

Vivek is one of the best Math Professors at Columbia I have encountered so far. His lectures are very clear, and he could explain the hard concepts in a relative easy way.  Usually, when I take math classes at Columbia, I have to watch other videos or do extra problem sets to understand the material well, and I believe many other students do the same thing. But if you take Vivek's class and pay attention during lectures, you won't freak out and seeking somebody else for help. Taking Vivek's class is a big saving of time, and I really appreciate all his help!
Tips for taking his class: 
His lecture notes and homework problems are crucial. I always review 2/3 times of his lecture notes and practice the homework problems twice. Such practice would help you getting familiar with all concepts he taught in class, and would guarantee your success in exams as well.

Professor Borer is one of the most kind and understanding professors I have met at Columbia. Our class was a 10:10 and naturally many students were late, tired, and more but she never raised her voice, or made a negative comment once. Although her calm nature does sometimes cause the class to become boring, her approachable manner, and smile make up for a great start of the day! 
The class is usually around 10 people, almost always has 2 people conversations that last for 20 mins where professor Borer walks around and listens. We watched movies in class, and read and watched theaters that add a French culture that I personally found very useful for my following semester in Paris. Professor Borer is very understanding of comments, suggestions and even criticism of French arts, which makes it very easy to talk in class, and you should talk! 
Although the participation looks like 'only' 25%, trust me, it is worth 99%. The class really moves through student participation and if you just stay in your corner thinking about when you'll make it to bed again, you will probably not get a good grade. 
The class is also for those who are more into the composition part of french. Though we technically had one class on grammar and one on composition each week, the readings (poems, essays, theaters by Moliere etc) and movies (Jules et Jim) are much more focused on. 
Homework is like any other language course, very regular, but you can miss doing one or two. She rarely collects them, she will tell you when she does. It will take time, depending on your french level, not more than any kind of elementary language course (2 hours per week or so)

You should take David's class. Whatever level it's at, if you need it and he's teaching it - You. Should. Take. David's. Class. 
In the past I've been hesitant to take classes with PHD students, and before his class had taken the other language levels with professors, but honestly his was the best experience I've had in a language class at Columbia thus far and not by a small margin. 
It's so important to feel comfortable in a language class and David has a laid-back teaching style and approachable-ness (mixed with a solid sense of humor) that  seems to put everyone at easy, making it so much easier (and more productive) when attempting to use the language.  
He also manages to get you through  the material in a way that leaves you feeling prepared for both the exams and the next class level - He even manages to keep subjects (like grammar) fairly interesting (or at least more interesting than other professors were able to) I'm honestly not sure exactly how he does it - all I know is that it's working. 
He never had a problem staying after class, answering questions or just generally helping you out. He's not out to crash your GPA and gives off the vibe that he wants you to do well
The best way I think I can explain it to you is by telling you that every student in my class. EVERY SINGLE ONE talked about how much they liked David as a professor. Even the kid who was always seemed like he hated it - wanted to go out of his way to thank him for the class.

I took this class last semester and am currently three weeks into an upper level psych lab with a different professor, feeling nostalgic and compelled to leave Professor Light a review. While, like other reviewers have suggested, I didn't find the course itself to be especially interesting (it is an intro course after all, so it's mainly about beginning how to conduct an experiment, use excel, write a paper (etc), I definitely learned the necessary skills and am now appreciative of that. I really think Professor Light was a great professor. It was clear he cared about what he was teaching, which helped, and was willing to meet with students outside of lab / genuinely cared about students doing well, and unlike what other reviews say, knew that a 1.5 intro lab wasn't anyone's first priority. While the workload did seem to be quite a bit at times, I'd say it was pretty fair overall. As I'm now taking psych lectures/labs with other professors, I realize how great of a person he was in terms of how he treated his students and how much he cares about the material and about teaching it; unfortunately, this doesn't seem to be a combination most professors have. Professor Light contributed in part to my decision to major in psych–– something I thought I would NEVER do, as I took this with the sole intention of fulfilling my science requirement. And last but not least, I'll forever remember his iconic April Fool's joke.

Kamaly's conversations were uninteresting and non-substantive. He is not good at directing discussion. The readings he assigns are pretty out of the blue and subject to last-minute change. They're also very inconsistent in length. There is no clear thesis or trajectory for the class. He does not write comments or grades on your essays--that's right, nothing, except maybe ""good"" or something short of that nature--which is annoying, lazy, and amazingly bad instruction considering there's no way to determine how you are doing and how you can improve. You will have no idea what your grade will be until you get it. His final is a ""conversation"" which seems sort of unstructured and strange. He is a very sensitive man, which can be a good thing, but in his case mostly inhibits him from relating to students because he seems insecure and a bit condescending.

This is a class in which you have to read a lot. There are a lot of texts that are quite dense to read and hard to get through but others that are simply fascinating. Sometimes you will be disgusted or indignant about something you just read. This is a class that makes you think and discuss. Although it might seem like a class designed for history students, it is accessible to all (if you put in the work!). Professor Rao truly seems to want all of her students to develop critical thinking skills and sets you on the right path to do so!

Every wonderful review you will read below about Nataliya is true, but I feel compelled to add to chorus of praise because Nataliya is just that good. Take a class with her!!! She is deeply passionate about her subject and about teaching. She obviously works incredibly hard, supervising the curriculum of all the First-Year Russian courses as well as teaching her own section. She returns every piece of writing you do, from basic grammar exercises to short stories and essays, with detailed comments/corrections the very next day. She is dedicated to her craft and is consistently prepared and engaging. Nataliya is endlessly energetic and her steadfast enthusiasm for an admittedly challenging subject is refreshing and inspiring. It's easy to fall in love with Russian when Nataliya is teaching it. She is also probably the most compassionate and kind-hearted professor I've had the pleasure of studying under. She is picky and demanding in only the best possible sense; she tirelessly corrects our pronunciation, cases, grammar, etc., and while this can be exhausting, it makes all the difference in developing a good accent and good grammar habits. After taking First-Year Russian last year, I happened to get the chance to have a conversation with a native Russian speaker over the summer. He told me that I must've had a good teacher, as my Russian was so ""clean"". Russia turns of phrase aside, he was absolutely right.

This class is terrible. Like another has posted, I don't understand how this man has a silver nugget. There is almost no structure to the class. There does not seem to be any purpose to it. Further, Mehrling seems to just be using the podium to 1) Sell his shitty books that nobody cares about and 2) feed his massive ego. Seriously, every single lecture somehow leads back to how he figured it all out in his second book he wrote.
His covered topics are based off of readings from the 1920s and 1930s, which is not by itself unreasonable for the field of economics, except that he is attempting to apply them to post recession central bank policy which is unprecedented in action. This just adds to the idea that, while no doubt incredibly intelligent, Mehrling just ""teaches"" this class to feed his ego.
Don't take this class, there's nothing exciting to learn. Read some financial newspapers and Google terms you don't understand. The reduced stress and time commitment will yield the same stated goal of the class: ""To give you the ability to read and understand Financial Times""

This is a joke of a class. Volunteer on the first day to write the lecture summary for that class, send it to the TA (who seems to really resent that he got stuck as a TA for this professor) and never return to class other than tests and to drop off homework.
All of his lectures are recorded, not that it matters because of his wild ramblings and nonsensical explanations for things, not to mention his immensely uncomfortable borderline, if not outright, racist comments at minority students.
The textbook has everything you need and is solid, but not great. The material is at least interesting if you are into international macroeconomics. (The material is largely focused on the interaction between exchange rates, interest rates and domestic output)

I enjoyed Elsa's Catalan language classes so much that I decided to take her Spanish elective on Intro Catalan Cultures too. Her classes are small, three to ten people, so be prepared to be engaged--and actually learn things that will help you gain a more nuanced, realistic picture of Barcelona and the surrounding Catalonia, plus Valencia, the Balearic Islands and Andorra.  
To those who say her courses are too much work, all I can say is you get out what you put in. Do the language work and you'll be having legit conversations by the end of one semester of beginning Catalan. Not even kidding. Elsa gives you all the attention you need to succeed, without ever putting you on the spot. She is kind and motivates you to express yourself, which keeps you on your toes and learning in every moment. 
Same goes for the Spanish elective, though the material is denser by nature. Do the readings and assignments and you'll be surprised by how much they actually connect to life in Barcelona and Catalonia, should you ever have the chance to visit or study abroad there. Sometimes Elsa assigns books, other times movies... either way, it's standard fare for a discussion course, and she's more than happy to guide you and answer questions along the way. She is Catalan and thus cares deeply about the material. If you dedicate time to learning about it, you just might care deeply about it too... And then decide to move to Barcelona. 
Workload:
Language classes -- the other reviews are accurate. Also, go to the weekly conversation hour at Casa Hispanica called ""Cafè Català."" You'll get extra practice chatting with Elsa and other Catalans (visiting students, instructors, etc.), and free coffee and cookies. Win, win. 
Spanish elective -- mostly writing and participation. Again, do the work and it pays off. The novels I read (one was even in English -- George Orwell ""Homage to Catalonia"") still stick with me. If you could do LitHum and CC, you can handle Elsa's elective.

I am still trying to understand this class, and how ridiculous and unfair it is. If you get below an 80 on the midterm, you lose 20 points on your final grade.

We try to cram in all the readings (100+ pages a week), but there's so much, we don't retain the info.

Despite some negative reviews, this course really wasn't bad at all. All the material for the exams is covered in class and readily available on her slides. It's true she doesn't try tremendously hard to make it exciting but it's intro stats after all and nearly everyone is taking it as a prereq for some other department, so this is to be expected. If you go to class, actually do the optional problem sets, make a comprehensive cheat sheet for each exam, and have a decent math ability, you'll do great. I'm not a math genius but I still pulled out an A+ mostly by copying the whole book onto a double-sided piece of paper for the exams. Probably the least workload of all my classes this semester.

I am a senior at Barnard, and Professor Hoch is the worst professor I have ever had. I don't know why she is still teaching at such a prestigious school. She reads verbatim from the slides, and then, when students have questions, she simply cannot answer them. Her catchphrase is ""Oh, I'm not sure. I'll let you know."" Well, she never does let us know. 
No one attends lecture because - let's be real - we all know how to read, and we can read from the slides that she posts online ourselves. Her class is miserably boring. She tries to show videos to make the concepts clearer for us, but they are usually ridiculous and unhelpful. She is also terribly disorganized. She takes weeks to grade assignments that she assigns to us the day before - not right. The work load is not light, and the exams are not easy, considering what a terrible professor she is. She should be fired, end of story. 
Workload:

I took Professor Gosse's Art Humanities class in Spring 2016.  I strongly recommend her class.
Johanna is an alumna of Barnard and much younger than the typical Columbia professors.  I think it's safe to say that she's ""cooler"" than them too.  She is very reasonable about the amount of workload that she assigns and you will learn a lot from her, without resenting being in her class.  I took the class because it is a graduation requirement, but I have already found myself using some of the concepts that I learned from her in my everyday life and in other classes.  With that said, it safe to say that I enjoyed her class.
Johanna demonstrated to me that she cared about my well-being as a student, which meant a lot to me.  She is approachable and makes herself available outside of class.  I recommend attending her field trips to museums (which are mandatory anyways) and staying late with her if she offers you extra time.  These field trips were my favorite part of the class, because Johanna applies concepts to real life art (as opposed to powerpoints). 
I was originally scheduled to take this class from another professor, but was able to switch into Johanna's after a week into the semester.  Unlike the other professor, Johanna wasn't boring and assigned a reasonable amount of work.  She also created a sense of community between myself and my classmates, whereas the other professor encouraged a sense of competition.

This was an excellent and interesting class. I took this class for a literature requirement at Barnard because I like medieval history and culture, but I don't think you need to have a prior interest in medieval literature in order to enjoy the class. All the texts are fun reads and don't take too long to go through. Professor Crane is great and she happily answers questions and encourages discussion of the readings. Her lectures are easy to follow and introduce historical and cultural context for the texts. She is really kind and supportive and was awesome to work with for a semester.
Workload:
Around fifty to a hundred pages of reading per week, some in older forms of English. I did not find it difficult to keep up with the readings week to week because they were usually interesting stories or myths.

This class is essential for anyone interested in the English literary tradition. You'll be introduced to (or much better acquainted with) compulsory works like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Beowulf, Tristram and Isolde, and Le Morte d'Arthur. If you are an English or Creative Writing major you will benefit enormously from taking this class with Susan Crane, specifically. Her knowledge of and enthusiasm for the material makes for a riveting experience. She'll read to you in Middle English and share relevant music and art that make for a thoroughly immersive encounter with this rich period. (She also possesses a David Foster Wallace-like understanding of syntax and grammar that will help you to refine your prose in ways that University Writing never did.) This is easily one of the most rewarding classes I have ever taken. I should also add, after our trip to the Rare Book & Manuscript Library, I've become obsessed with rare books and older forms manuscript production. I don't know if the other professors who teach this class offer as much supplementary insight into the period and material, so I'd suggest playing it safe and taking it with Professor Crane (who also happens to be one of the warmest/friendliest professors on campus).

Professor Hoch is one of the worst professors I have ever had. If I didn't need it for a requirement I would've dropped it. Her lectures are incredibly dry, she reads off her slides, and when asked a question, she always finds some way to avoid it. I learned more by reading 2 0/)// in the textbook then I have in her lectures. She is an incredibly sweet woman but this woman cannot teach. When I met with her to talk about my difficulty with testing, she told me that I should probably not be taking classes that require me to take exams, and should stick with papers.

Prof. Paparella is a nice lady for the most part, except she is lowkey really brutal about essays and even your ideas. She cannot lead discussion very well, mainly because she shoots people's ideas down and then questions them in an attempt to get you to assert your answer which 9/10 times failed and instead just embarrassed the student. I dreaded this class every single day and so did the 15 other girls who were in my class. It was unenjoyable because no one wanted to participate in discussion, no one ever knew what she wanted on the essays which resulted in a lot of anxiety, and leg of med is just shit in general because the books are ancient and not very engaging. 
She wants you to write her way or no way at all and her way is completely different than what most of us learned back in highschool. As far as grading goes, however, she's really understanding about essay grades and if you screw one up she'll weigh the other one so as not to count the bad one.

Professor Pazzaglini is the best teacher I've met during my college career. He really listens to his students and cares deeply about their mental and physical well-being more than many teachers I've met. He then adapts his teaching method and the length of reading assignments to meet what he understands as a reasonable requirement.
From the day we first met, Pazzaglini brought his extensive knowledge of Latin and the Catholic Church into class discussions, thereby enriching our understanding of Core texts. As a scholar himself with many years behind him, he is a source of great knowledge in the classroom, allowing him to clearly and confidently articulate complex philosophical ideas.
He is most importantly attentive to his students in ways many teachers are not. He notices the small details, the small gestures of friendship students make or the moment a student reaches out to help another in need. He pays attention to these details and accesses a student not only on how she performs academically but also on how well she treats her classmates and herself.
Professor Pazzaglini is more than a teacher of CC. He is a teacher of life values of companionship, friendship, and caring. He is a teacher whose lessons transcend the text themselves and enter our hearts and minds. In short, he is a mentor and a leader.

So, I took this class to fulfill the Core Curriculum Art Humanities requirement. I'm Chinese, so I thought it would be cool to learn more about my culture, rather than something focused on Western Art. 
DO NOT BE LIKE ME. 
Look, this class actually has a really interesting subject matter. But the professor is so awful that it totally ruins it. Chusid is just NOT a good teacher. She treats everyone like they're still in high school. Everything consists of memorizing dates, dynasties, etc. and random facts she tells you about pieces - there is no synthesis as to what larger scope any piece has as it relates to the culture. I honestly could better teach myself from the assigned readings. Everything is just short-term memorization; I know for a fact that I will not remember anything I learned in this class by midterms next semester. 
The other thing I really have a problem with is that I feel that Miriam has no respect for her students. We are a week past midterms now, and there are 3-4 students that she still cannot call on by name. She has asked them each repeatedly what their names are, we have turned in assignments, there is just no excuse.

This class was a lot different than I expected going in. While I was excited for the class, about 3 weeks in I realized it wasn't what I wanted. The labs are very computer based and the hands on part are remedial at best. I felt the entire lab section of this class was not very interesting and was heavily math-based. The class felt like I was taking another math class, but gave entirely new formulas that were given very little context on how to use.

This class is very boring to say the least. Professor Kelemen simply rambles on about geological processes and data for the entire class period. His lectures consist solely of graphs and random data often taken from other sources including Wikipedia. He expects his students to be versed in highly technical geological terms and calculations and as a result most of his lectures are impossible to follow and understand fully. If you take this class expect to not understand the majority of topics discussed. The textbook that is required reading is hardly ever discussed in class and also highly technical. I guess the workload can be considered as light--two essays for the entire term plus a midterm or final, or one essay and participation in a discussion section (in which you give one presentation) plus a midterm and final. The midterm is simply 50 multiple choice questions so you can get away with not paying attention at all in class and studying the possible midterm questions posted on coursework. If you are genuinely interested in learning about sustainable development I would not recommend this class unless you are prepared to do all the reading and suffer through incredibly boring lectures. If you are someone looking to get the science requirement out of the way, this is a class that you can get by doing little work and still do reasonably well.

I had Porzak for a GS section of UW, and I loved him.  He is a writer by trade, so he really knows what he's doing.  He's incredibly knowledgeable about so many seemingly unrelated topics, but he doesn't make his students feel dumb.  In addition to being brilliant, he's also very funny.  I genuinely enjoy his class.  
The greatest aspect of his class, though, is the way he helps students revise.  For each progression paper, he makes ~11 minute personal YouTube videos with his comments for each person's essay along with annotations on the text itself.  His comments are insightful, personal, and helpful.  I really feel like I've improved as both a reader and a writer this semester.

The course texts he chooses are really hard, (dense, difficult language or vocabulary, sometimes long) and the daily workload can sometimes be overwhelming.

She's really great at facilitating class discussions - I have no background in art/art history/analysis whatsoever, but I found it easy to say something of value in class. It's really relaxed, but I also learned a lot that I didn't think I was going to retain..and then I went to Italy and was able to pull from what she had talked about. Her grading is lenient, and she makes sure you know what to expect for the tests and papers so you're well prepared.

Since she is teaching this same course next semester and there is a choice between taking it with her and with another professor and also since we have just gotten back our mid-terms and first papers I will comment on what the experience of taking this course has been like up to now. She is a pretty good teacher. I would say she isn't particularly good or bad....she gets the job done, nothing special. This class is supposed to be a sort of East Asian version of Art Hum and she even said at the beginning that participation would be important but it seems like the same handful of regulars do 90% of the commenting. The first half of the course deals with Buddhist art in all three countries which unite the region and then goes into what makes the three countries distinct in the second half. She went off syllabus in the first half and so didn't get to everything. Personally I was left feeling like I didn't get so much from the first half, maybe this had to do with her choices of objects to analyze. For some reason at Columbia T.A.'s are brought into a class basically to just lighten the load for the teacher as far as grading goes so in a class of 19 people we had a T.A. grade the paper and Professor Chusid grade the mid-terms. This makes it difficult to predict what will be looked for in the final paper and final exam if they swap, which is frustrating. The paper was graded fairly lightly by the T.A. Just make sure you have an actual thesis statement in your introductory paragraph even for a short 3 page formal analysis. I thought Professor Chusid graded the mid-term a bit severely, so def. prepare a lot for that and hit all the points she mentions in class when discussing a piece, even then you probably won't be able to get a perfect score because she looks for very specific things about each piece, some of which may not seem very important. I was hoping this class would be a really engaging experience because it was so small but I'm not sure it is that much better than the 70 person session which is held by other professors who teach this same course.

I took this class over the summer and was pretty happy with it. You'll spend a lot of time in the dark looking at slides but that's to be expected I suppose. I found that Rachel graded fairly. The exams were open note. The only thing I would warn about it messing around during class with your phone or something like that, because she will basically cut you. Also, she doesn't seem to love being disagreed with, which was odd. However, the lectures weren't boring and the material wasn't difficult.

While his socratic teaching method was at first a little foreign, after a few weeks in the class I actually appreciated how this teaching style invoked deeper thought on my part which ultimately led to a deeper understanding of the material. With regards to the course layout, I found the order to which the material was presented to be extremely logical and easy to follow. It is very obvious that Professor Terrace is extremely knowledgeable in this subject which made going to lecture a very informative and thought provoking experience. The amount of information that we were held responsible for was very manageable and I felt it was introduced at a very reasonable rate.

I had him for my first semester Calculus I. I had taken Calc AB before. A lot of people struggled with the class (and dropped) but I liked it. 
It's a kind of 'lecture optional class' in the sense that if you get what you're doing skipping class wouldn't hurt you that much (he basically teaches the textbook)  - but he drops hints (useful but sometimes confusing) regarding the midterms and goes over hard homework questions (before they are due).
We had weekly WebAssign (low key pain) and Textbook Homework (2 lowest ones are dropped from each). Aside from that we had 2 midterms and an exam. No calculators on the exams, but you can bring in an index card (front and back) with whatever you want on it. 
Weighting: Homework (20%), First Midterm (20 %), Second Midterm (25 %) and Final exam (35 %)

Probably the easiest LitHum section in the world. Karen is a good teacher, and loves Greek literature, so she's is constantly teaching us about the Greek translation etc. Gave us some sweet hook-ups to Greek events across the city. We rarely had quizzes (and often we could do them together). Our midterm was easy. We only had 2 papers for the semester and that's it in terms of grading.

Francisca is an excellent professor.  Super nice, pretty funny, and overall just wonderful at teaching Spanish.  The majority of the class is in Spanish, which I think is really helpful for learning, but she will say things in English at times just to make sure the important stuff is clear.  She's very willing to answer any questions and makes an effort to get to know and to interact with her students.  Of the three Spanish classes I've taken at Columbia, this one is probably the most work-intensive but it's not too bad.  She assigns a lot of MySpanishLab (I think she doesn't know how time-intensive and annoying it is), which is a bummer and there is at least a little bit of homework from one or both of the textbooks due each class.  She's a kind of lenient grader in my opinion though and her quizzes (one each unit) are very easy.
Overall, if you can take Spanish with her, do it!  You won't regret it and you'll learn a lot.

Professor Coen is one of the worst professors I have had at Barnard. Her lectures are dry and filled with analysis of blocks of text not in the reading that she flashes on the screen for two seconds. She answers questions with the statement, ""Oh, that's interesting, I'll answer that later,"" and then never does or continues by saying that the point is ""an important idea that really impacts the text"" without saying how. She is obviously uncomfortable veering off her printed out pages of notes that she brings to class. I'm sure she's an excellent researcher, but she's a terrible lecturer and cannot get ideas across to save her life. If someone asks a question that's inappropriate to the course, she will say, ""Oh, that should really be discussed in office hours"" and will then spend 5 minutes talking about it. 
She is unapproachable outside of class, so don't even bother trying to go to her office hours because she will begin by telling you that she has limited time to speak to you.

Nomaduma is the WORST instructor I have ever had at Columbia. DO NOT take Art Hum with her - it would make you hate art history. IT IS SIMPLY A DISASTER.
She's a PhD student so she may not teach every semester, but I'm writing this review (this is the first review that I've ever written) because I'm genuinely disappointed in her class, and I don't want anybody who has the slightest interest in art history to take this utterly boring and unsubstantial class. She just doesn't know what she's talking about. I feel like I've learned more by going through the readings myself and looking up on wikipedia than going to her class.
I have taken art history before and it really is an interesting subject, but Nomaduma is just ruining it for me. Sitting in her class is a real waste of my time. I'm so disappointed that I really wonder why Columbia lets her teach. Ughhh!!!!
Oh and she regularly cancels classes so we're always behind the schedule that she has set.

I don't know how Teresa Sharpe doesn't have a silver nugget yet-- she has a cult following within the Sociology department. 
She is a thoughtful teacher who clearly takes undergraduate teaching very seriously. Her lectures are engaging and all of the readings are meaningful-- Sharpe assigns no busywork, and usually the final papers are opportunities to explore something you're really interested in. Usually her classes are lecture + powerpoint style, but she has a knack for making discussions happen in classes of 60-80 people. If you can take her for Sociology of Work and Gender-- DO IT! She will revolutionize how you think about work, so if you ever plan to have a job (regardless of your own gender)-- take it!)

Helfand is a great professor, lecturer, and person. I learned a lot in his class, found lecture pretty entertaining (he has some great demonstrations), and the work load was not bad at all. The problem sets can be tricky but you can work in groups and if you go to OF he explains everything. Quizzes were all open note and not bad at all and you were allowed a cheat sheet for the midterm. You don't have to do the assigned textbook reading (even though its super manageable), all you have to do is listen during lecture.
Overall 10/10, loved the class, loved the professor - he actually cares about his students and puts a lot of effort into his lesson plans, making sure he explains everything in a very clear, detailed manner. He was always able to answer any questions I had and in general is an interesting dude.

A few very strange things have happened in this class which have prompted me to write this review. I will try to do my best to give as much of an objective account as I possibly can. I will address Konstanina Zanou as Konstantina because that is what she has asked us to call her in class. It is not meant out of disrespect. As for the quotations, I am doing my absolute best to be faithful to her actual wording, but my memory isn't perfect.
I. Very Personal Approach
The thing that strikes me most is Konstantina's incredibly personal approach to teaching. This, for the first few weeks, seemed amusing and perhaps even nice - but as time went on, it developed into something rather uncomfortable. 
She often makes personal remarks about students in front of other students (half jokingly, half not), such as telling someone that it's okay that they didn't do well on the first paper because there are other ones, or that such and such needs to prioritize school over sports, or that ""the blondes aren't participating"", etc.
Also, she organized a few out-of-class trips (I think with the best intentions) and (as far as I could tell) didn't realize that most of the students didn't want to stay for dinner with her after one such event (they had to pay for their own dinner but felt uncomfortable saying no to her invitation).
She tells many personal anecdotes in class, which are (I have to admit) amusing in a shocking sort of way. She told us about her ex-lover who she met after many years of being apart and who, she had hoped, might still be suitable for her and then, after a summer together, it turned out that he ""was stupid!"" The point of this anecdote was to explain the way nostalgia alters our recollections.
During that same discussion she asked the students to share personal stories. When people didn't want to share (because they felt uncomfortable), she assumed that we had never experienced nostalgia (inaccurately reading the vibe of the classroom).
She showed us an X rated film (Dionysus in '69) in class without much context, which lead to an uncomfortable viewing experience and an even more uncomfortable discussion afterwards (to make it clear - I am not against showing X rated films in class, but there needs to be some sort of contextualization so that the class understands WHY the film is being watched and feels comfortable talking about it afterwards). The film was intended to be sexually arousing (it was based on the Bacchae) and watching it with Konstantina in the room was - I use the word AGAIN - uncomfortable.
She seems to believe that she can read other people (I hazard to guess it might be her acting background), which means that she sometimes psychoanalyzes her students. She told one girl that she reminded her of herself in many ways and then told her that she had a mental breakdown in her 20s and doesn't want this girl to experience the same thing (a conclusion she reached based on very little in-class interaction). I only give one example because I don't want to share stories online that other students might not want shared. This is not the only time she has done something like that, however.
She told us that she wants the class to feel ""more like a book-club discussion with friends"" rather than a seminar, partly because she was reading many of the texts for the first time in English or at all.
II. Requirements for Papers/Exams
Instead of writing in my own words, I will copy paste a few of her requirements below. These are direct quotes from her assignment sheet:
""Simple, clear sentences with neat, appropriate terms are better than convoluted sentences and pompous phrases. Your sentences should not be more than 2 lines long."" (she grades down if they are longer than 3 lines)
""Don’t psychoanalyze. I am not interested in claims along the lines of 'Because Achilleus is childish and attached to Patroklos, he refuses to participate in battle.' Characters are not real people with psyches. They are fictional depictions, crafted by an author or multiple authors. All you have access to is the words on the page that actually describe them. Do not speculate. Analyze what we do have access to.""
""In the first paragraph of your paper (Introduction) you should state what your thesis statement (=argument) is and be crystal clear about it. I should have no doubt after your first paragraph as to what exactly you will be arguing in your paper. A good way to do this is to signpost (“I argue first that ... subsequently turning to.... in order to show...”). All paragraphs and observations should relate to this central thesis statement. A cluster of unrelated or only vaguely-related observations about a topic, however brilliant, does not a paper make. Everything you say should contribute to a single argument.""
That last quotation is crucial - because it seems reasonable enough on its own, but Konstantina also expects the students to include all of the material discussed in class that is relevant to her prompt. In other words, when one student decided to write about ""the animals in Homer"" and didn't include the horses in his argument (because the horses were an animal that was not relevant to his argument), he was told that that sort of omission was unpardonable because ""horses are animals too!"" So, if we are to include all of the material discussed in class, then it is incredibly hard (perhaps impossible) to write a cohesive paper with a clear thesis (unless the thesis is rather broad and more of a summation than an argument).
All of these requirements are easy to follow once you understand what she wants, so it is not hard to get decent grades as long as you are able to tailor your writing to her expectations (which may feel, at times, like it is making your paper worse).
As for the midterms, she grades based on class discussion. After the test, she told us that she ""didn't take away points for additional information if it was correct"" which translates to: ""I only gave credit for the things we explicitly said in class"". Several students did quite poorly on the midterm because they gave their own interpretations of the text thinking that Konstantina wanted to see original thought rather than the things we have already discussed. She said that she grades this way because ""how else would [she] be able to grade them?""
III. Just started teaching at Columbia and it shows
This is more of a minor point, but if you are placed in a Lit Hum class soon after Fall 2016, realize that Fall 2016 was her first time ever teaching at Columbia (not only Lit Hum, but any class in general).
Conclusion:
This is, undoubtedly, a negative review. I tried my best to remain ""objective"" (whatever that may mean) and give facts rather than personal opinions - although I included personal opinions in parentheses when I thought some sort of explanation was necessary.
Take my opinion with a grain of salt, but also recognize that if you take Lit Hum with Konstantina it will not be your average Lit Hum experience. Whether that is a good or bad thing, you will have to decide for yourself.

This is one of the most unique science courses I've taken as a pre-med at Columbia. Dr. Loike's style of teaching is unique to anything you'll see in your standard 300-person lecture course and frankly a fun, high-energy, breath of fresh air. Whether you are already familiar with the principles of bioethics or a new-comer to the field, Dr. Loike makes the experience educational, timely and relevant. Each week in class a new or upcoming biological technology is presented and the class is made to discuss the bioethical issues that are associated with it as well as how they may be resolved. However, instead of simply opening up the class for debate, 2-3 students begin the discussion by presenting a ""scientific theater"" presentation of sorts where they are assigned roles (ie. someone who is considering using the technology, the developer of the technology, someone who is against use of the technology, etc) and present bioethical arguments related to the technology through various lenses. The rest of the class then has the opportunity to ask each character questions, or respond to what the characters have said. It was a very unique and fun spin to put on a seminar and often made for the emergence of viewpoints that otherwise may not have even been considered. I genuinely enjoyed going to this seminar (which by the way is just once a week!) and came away with a solid grasp of the principles of bioethics as well as a basic knowledge of many biotechnologies I had been aware had existed. 
Dr. Loike also brought in several guest speakers throughout the semester (ie. FBI agents specializing in contagious diseases/bioterrorism). It was super interesting to hear their direct perspectives on their given area of expertise and a nice change of pace from weekly student-led class discussions. 
Overall I would definitely recommend this course if you're looking for a nice and easy change of pace from your standard (read: hellish) premed classes. You can tell Dr. Loike is super passionate about his field. His high energy and chosen class style really did make going to class something to look forward to, (unlike that orgo lecture you're still looking for an excuse to skip). Essentially if you want to block out an hour and fifteen minutes once a week to have some intellectually stimulating discussions about bioethics and biotechnology, get an easy A, and get 2 credits out of it, I'd recommend you look no further. 
Workload:
This course is also VERY easy to do well in. It's graded primarily based on participation--if you attend class and try your best to make a thoughtful comment or two at each session, you should be A OK. There are weekly courseworks posts (read: single paragraphs) due each week that basically just require you to write 4 thoughtful sentences about the technology being discussed in class that week. These posts are not graded, but marked as complete/incomplete. The midterm for this course is a choice between either a partner op-ed paper (which you have the opportunity to redact later for a higher grade), or a partner/group music video (obviously I chose the music video but either way you slice it the midterm was a breeze)! The final for the course is another partner-paper (5 pages, if I remember correctly)--if you put in some time you should be able to crank it out in a weekend!

This is the best class I have ever taken and I learned more practical knowledge here than in four years at this school. You work with your hands a lot, both building set models and fixing things. The class is very interdisciplinary, you read everything from plays, to anthropology texts, to NY times articles. There are three major components to this class researching, fixing and designing (it is a theatre class after all). She is very open about the class being somewhat in flux though.
You spend an entire class learning how to fix things and fixing your own things. I learned how to solder and sew and fix an iphone charger and jewelry all while reading about how to break the cycle of use and discard not only in theatre but in our daily lives. Sandra is really focussed on sustainability and the environmental impact of consumerism. Be prepared to question and problematize every day items you do not actually need. 
This is not an easy A class and do not take it for that purpose. The readings are manageable and honestly I did not do most of them and still did well. Quality of work is more important to Sandra than quantity of work done. Read the plays you will be designing though, that is important. There is a lot of thought that goes into this class and if you are not prepared to come to class and think on your feet and with your hands designing on the spot do not take it. Sandra expertly interweaves elements of thing theory into explaining stuff that we use as theatre artists. Sandra is tough, she expects a lot and at a high caliber, but the more you put into this the more you will get out of it. 
Workload:
Very manageable but hard because it takes a lot of thought and creativity. Moderate to heavy reading but not all of it is necessary. Designing in and out of the classroom, fixing somethings and one presentation.

Loveliest, most incredible teacher, and an all around great person. She truly wants all of her students to do well and you will get an A if you show up and put in the effort. She makes even the most difficult material comprehensive and she always makes time to meet with her students directly after class in her office if needed. She always shows up to class in a good mood, despite it being really early in the morning and she makes every single class enjoyable. Her class was one that I always looked forward to waking up to because I knew it would be lighthearted and I also knew that I would learn a lot in an engaging way.

Sara Ede is the absolute worst. I emailed her once for help to reschedule an exam for religious reasons after my professor gave me an indefinitive answer and she forwarded it to the professor, breaking student-adviser confidence and letting the professor know that I was trying to circumvent her authority. 
Also she mysteriously disappeared during registration last year and I missed out on classes I wanted to register for since my account had a hold on it that should have been removed. This isn't an isolated incident, Dean Ede is famous for ghosting during the worst time, earning her the nickname ""casper"" among students ill-fated enough to be assigned her as adviser. 
Besides that she is annoyingly unhelpful, curt, and always overloaded. She responds to emails in the most short and unhelpful ways, saving her precious email time to long spammy emails about nothing to all her advisees so her bosses can see that she is doing something. The worst qualities you can ask for in an adviser. If you are shelling out 70k a year for this university, you deserve much better, so if you get assigned to ol' Sara ""casper"" Ede, my advise is to transfer immediately.

Listen, I know that all these reviews basically state, ""yada yada yada, the woman is a delight"". But she absolutely is - and it's worth the reiteration.
Cathy Popkin is considerably more than just a highly qualified academic. Despite the fact that she must have read, heard or considered nearly everything there could possibly be to say on the subject matter, my often half-baked ideas have never been so engaged with by somebody in the teaching profession. Her love for the readings is palpable, and her patience and enthusiasm for discussion verges on superhuman. In all sincerity, the hardest thing about the class is not having enough hands to have one in the air, one in the book, and one taking notes at any given moment. If I could come back as an animal, it would be an orangutan, just so I could take this class again and type with my feet. And yes, I'm keenly aware that the tone of this review has gotten well out of hand. You might well conclude that I'm some kind of sycophantic lunatic... but I regret nothing. If you're even remotely curious about Russian lit, please take one of her classes.
I've also had a class with the equally lauded Liza Knapp. If you're deciding between the two... take both. It's a horrible choice to have to make. If there was any justice, both of these instructors would have gold nuggets. God bless them. God bless Russian literature.

While FroSci may not be the most interesting class, Dr. Hughes is the nicest lady. If you get her for FroSci, stay in the section.

Professor Weber is an amazing teacher. She is very intelligent and well versed in the texts that she teaches.
I had her for a first year seminar class at Barnard and she was a pleasure to have in a smaller setting.
She is very approachable during office hours and grades pretty fairly.
She holds her students to a very high standard, but at the same time it is your imperative to meet this standard.
My only qualm is that she is a little disorganized from time to time. Although she isn't on top of every detail, she is always apologetic when she makes mistakes, which makes everything okay.

I had Professor Guo for Analysis II in Fall 2016 - I'm writing this now since I realized he didn't have any reviews yet on culpa. I believe it was the first semester he taught at Columbia (he got his Ph.D. just in 2015) and he did a pretty decent job considering that. I've heard that after his first semester of teaching he made tweaks to his exam difficulty and I've heard only good things about his classes since.
Lectures:
 - Professor Guo is very clear and helpful during lectures. During class he would pretty much just go through the content in Rudin (with some added intuition here or there) and if you ever had a question about anything he would give a good answer. 
Exams:
 - The exams were very very difficult. I was in a class of 15 or so people who were all math/CS majors and the average on the midterm was a 26/60. The format was 6 problems, 1 from the homework and 5 original problems which required a lot of ingenuity to solve -- they weren't just simple applications of the material. Of course, this means that people who knew the material but didn't have the intuition for the tricks needed to solve the exam problems ended up doing poorly, which is understandably never a good feeling. The final was 10 problems which were all original.
Workload:
Homeworks:
 - His homeworks were pretty hard, but short -- just 4 problems. About half of the class would regularly go to the TA's office hours for help, and a lot of the time it would be us doing the problems together with the TA, since the TA didn't know how to do them immediately. Probably spent 4-5 hours on homework per week.

I echo the review below. Sandrine was a great professor; her lectures were concise, discussions were productive and most importantly - expectations were clear. Yes, she is pretty dry (lights are turned off during class and you flip through images on most days) but, you also get do some fun things like visit museums and a cathedral. 
Anyways, if you need to take ArtHum and are looking for a professor, I would recommend taking this course - getting an A is extremely easy if you just show up to class.
P.S. - there is a fair amount of reading (no need to do it all)! Skim through every other reading or so and you will be fine. None of the readings are tested on, but you want to make sure you have something to contribute to the class discussion here and there as participation counts, and she will jot peoples names down when the comment.

Professor Pittman is one of the best professors I've had. He is a young and energetic lecturer, and is able to break down difficult texts in a way that is both interesting and relatable as a student. Class time goes by fast, and, even in a large lecture setting, isn't dominated solely by him speaking. He genuinely wants to hear from the students in his class. We've watched and discussed videos and commercials, and have even spent a bulk on class reading ""men seeking men"" craigslist ads. This class is fascinating and a lot of fun, but you still learn a lot too, and the workload definitely isn't ""easy"". Pittman assigns sizable readings between classes, especially over the weekend, and the concepts discussed within the readings can often be difficult to understand, as Pittman himself acknowledges. Pittman asks us to engage the multiple texts and the theories proposed in response papers, and in our midterm, so it's important to actually understand them. It's hard to bullshit. I would certainly recommend taking a class with this Professor. He is young, passionate, and engaging. He knows everyone's name in our lecture class!
However, he does take attendance at the start of every class, which is somewhat unusual for a lecture. So if you're hoping to skim the readings, bang out the papers, and only come to class some of the time, probably isn't the best class for you.

This course pretty hard to get through. I loved the topic the class and enjoyed reading many of the readings. However, the class itself was not properly taught in a way to encourage us to share our ideas, our thoughts, and our questions. 
Professor Hurwitz tends to teach this class, but unfortunately she did not create a sense of community/belonging in the classroom even though there were only 7-8 of us.  Class discussions were painful, awkward, and uninspiring because of the way they were moderated. A few times, our class would start to go down an interesting path, and students started sharing their ideas more fluidly... then the professor would stop us,, which was pretty odd.  Grading for this course is pretty muddy, so don't expect this to be a easy.  
The professor also likes to randomly call on you if it seems like you may have something to say or have a look of confusion/excitement on your face, so be prepared for that.  Lastly, Professor H constantly encouraged students to come to office hours, but refused to answer questions directly. It was very difficult to communicate with her and have an ""easy"" conversation. The one time I attended office hours I left feeling frustrated, and overwhelmed.  Office hours were possibly more painful than class itself.

  Martina Mims is by far the best professor that I have had in Columbia. I wonder why she hasn't had a golden nugget here. I took Arthum with her last year, and she was very encouraging, but she also commented on what is right/wrong in people's comments, making you learn a lot in a relaxed atmosphere.
  She genuinely cares about her students. It's been over a year and she keeps asking how we're doing when some of us from that class run into her sometimes, and has written rec letters for a few of us. In fact, at the beginning of the my Arthum class last year when I told her that I felt sort of intimidated because I had no background in art, she took me to a cafe on campus, bought me water, sat down with me outdoor, and encouraged me with really sincere words. I became very involved in that class. She has that attitude towards all of her students, and obviously knows well about them: when someone doesn't talk in class, she will call on that person by pointing our his/her previous experience or probable expertise on this matter and invite him to comment on this. Everyone gets to participate in some way, and actually enjoys the class.

Like another reviewer said, Andreas should not have a silver nugget. DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS. 
I originally switched into the class because of the good reviews on this page and because a friend in the class (who also ended up hating it) recommended him based on the good culpa reviews and his good first impressions. I was genuinely excited to take CC with Andreas but was very quickly disappointed. I switched out for the spring semester as soon as possible.
Do no disregard the negative reviews about this professor and don't fall for his marketing techniques. Andreas makes a good first impression, presenting himself as fair and open minded. He is not. Although he encourages questions and engagement with the texts he really only encourages these things as long as they fit into his plan for the class and his narrow conception of what CC should be. The essay questions he poses seem open ended but given the stringent restrictions he imposes, his students are really pushed into corroborating the viewpoint he espouses. There is only the illusion of freedom with his prompts and for most of his assignment. Though he says he is not looking for specific answers, students will do far better grade wise if they regurgitate what he preaches in class rather than forming other arguments, even if those arguments are valid and supported by evidence.
He is arrogant and the quirks that seem intriguing at first really turn out to be those of an overly pedantic professor with an axe to grind. All of this would be somewhat mitigated if he offered good insight and analysis of the texts and their significance, but that is not the case and the class discussions are often basic, limited in their scope and sometimes just downright illogical/nonsensical. Overall, this has been the most intellectually impoverished and frustrating experience I have had at Columbia.

This class will seem deceptively easy at first, but as the semester goes along the difficulty of the material increases drastically. Do not underestimate the materials! The lectures are dry but he presents plenty of examples to help you understand them. He also hosts help sessions where he shows you how to get the answers to the homework, if not show you the entire solution.

Hoch is one of the most useless professors I've ever met. She cannot teach for the life of her. All she does is read off her powerpoints which she posts online anyway so why bother going to class? I think the material she teaches is super interesting as a psychology major, but she makes it as dry and boring as humanly possible. During lecture, she gives bizarre examples to try and explain the material, but all they do is confuse the class even more. 
She also can't write an exam worth a damn. If you expect to do well simply by self studying, then you're shit out of luck. When one of my friends asked her whether or not we should focus on textbook or lecture more, she said, ""Oh if you just memorize my study guide and you'll do fine!"" BULL SHIT. I did exactly that AND read the textbook cover to cover AND looked through all of her powerpoints and did dreadful on the exams. Not that I expected to do well because her exam questions read like they were written by a monkey with a computer. I'm not sure if it's even humanly possible to get a good grade in this class because she doesn't curve a single one of her terribly written exams. 
Don't take this class, at least not with her. If someone else teaches it, anyone else, then go for it. In the hands of a different professor, it would probably be much more interesting and actually worth your time.

The materials in this class are very interesting and the programming assignments let you apply most of what you've learned in class.

Rachel Austin is one of the most amazing teachers I have ever had in my school career thus far. Gen Chem is not easy at all, but I am sure anyone who is reading this already knows that. I spend many, many hours studying and doing homework for this class every week. However, if you put in the work to study and do your homework, Rachel will make sure you succeed in the class. 
You must attend her office hours if you are not already great at chemistry and are still hoping for a high grade. Not every lecture is specifically helpful, but during her office hours she will explain anything to you and I promise you will understand even the most difficult concepts if you attend office hours and come with questions or with a mind ready to learn chemistry! She is patient and kind, no matter how basic and sometimes dumb the question is. She also answers questions online in the class discussion form all of the time, so basically her office hours are always happening online. I mean, the woman takes the time to memorize most of the class's names and there are 170+ students in the class! 
Her classroom style is flipped. She uploads videos (which you can get through quickly if you watch them at double speed) before class and then instead of lecturing she puts up problems for you to work through with your peers during class. This doesn't work for everyone but I guarantee it will work better if you actually watch and digest the videos before showing up. Again, if this isn't helpful for you just make sure you watch the videos, don't go to class, and attend office hours instead to clarify any point from the videos.
The tests can be a little tricky, but her ""automatic curve"" that results from her lowered grading scale (an 88 is an A- just for example) and the fact that she drops two of your four test scores (you don't even have to take the final if you are happy with two of your other test scores!!!) basically even it out. If you know the basics very well and can apply your knowledge you will do well on the tests. 
This is super long winded, but the main point is that this class can be fun if you decide to have a growth mindset. As someone with no chemistry experience in the past I can honestly say I have learned so much and I have thoroughly enjoyed being in Rachel's class. I would take the harder class here at Barnard with Rachel and really understand chemistry, then have an easier time in huge gen chem class at Columbia where I don't comprehend as well and don't get the same personal attention.

I think the trick is to make the paper looks nice i.e. use a lot of graphs and make it pretty like a pitchbook in banking. For me, it is an easy A. 
The material isn't hard and it is interesting.

I took Professor McKelway's course on the arts of Japan and would say that it was a bit of a mixed bag. First off, he is a really smart guy and knows a ton about Japanese art. Whenever he lectured it seemed like the information just rolled off the top of his head in a way which conveyed that he had a clear grasp of the subject matter. One of the things I appreciated about his style was that instead of making us memorize huge amounts of objects, though memorization was still a big part of the class, he tried to take time with each object and allow people to make comments, effectively running the course like a large Art Humanities class instead of an introductory lecture. This was interesting to me because I had not taken Art Hum at the time and so I was able to really learn a lot about how art is discussed at Columbia and in academia in general. 
Downside to this though is that we did not make it to the Edo Period in Japanese art. In fact we barely made it through the Momoyama period. This is a huge concern, because we didn't even touch the last 400 years of Japanese art in a course which is supposed to be an overview of art from the country. This disorganization also showed up in courseworks where the readings were not listed in a way which made it easy to tell which reading was for which week and at the end of the semester I carefully went through the readings he posted and compared them with the syllabus and am totally certain that some readings were never uploaded. This points to his lack of consideration for students, e-mails often went unanswered and classes or museum visits were cancelled. Also, and this was a first for me, we didn't do all of the assignments on the syllabus. He had listed three papers and we only did 2. He can be helpful in office hours but I found that often the conversation would turn to personal chat too quickly or he would give me way too much information on a question I asked and I wouldn't be able to ask all the questions I had. 
Summation, he isn't awful by any stretch. You will learn a lot about Japanese Art and how to look at and talk about art in general. As long as disorganization and going off syllabus doesn't bother you it will be worthwhile. All the grading was done my the T.A.'s so I can't say how harsh a grader he is.

I just want to write a review to temper the universal praise this course and professor have received. I was really excited to take this class partly because of the stellar reviews they received. This class is a lot of memorization and memorization that will be useless to you unless you go further into studying this field. I was not inspired by the lectures nor did I even find them interesting. You look at famous works like the Venus from Melos and basically just learn when it was made and who possibly made it. You don't get very much Greek history or culture in this class. Maybe if Professor had slowed down it would have felt more worthwhile.
Don't take this class if you looking for a course which will give you an understanding of Greek art which be with you for a lifetime. Don't take this class if you are not prepared to memorize hundreds of works. The professor plows through the objects at a quick pace and you will fall behind quickly if you aren't keeping up. Just to make it even worse he includes some works from the first half so you have to memorize everything for the final because you have no idea what will be on there. I just found that the work I put into this class didn't really pay off. 
He also bragged about how he reads all of the final papers and makes comments on them but his comments were nearly worthless, occasional spelling corrections and then a final grade, that's it. He will also call people out in class, especially the ones who look like they are trying to hide. So if you are shy or don't do the readings this can be stressful. By the way, the readings are to prepare you for the lectures and do not need to be used on the midterm and final. Again, memorization is the focus. If you love Greek art and this is your thing then go for it but if you are on the fence then maybe take something else.

To begin with, Fay is a great person. She is truly very kind, lovable, and obviously cares a lot about her students. She's always responsive to emails, holds extra office hours if needed and answers every question, no matter how simple or complex. That being said, for the love of God, do not take this class. 
It is a general rule with STEM labs that you won't be getting much (if anything at all) from the work you do in the course. We all know it, the TAs know it and the professors know it. Fay did not seem to get that memo. Intensive Organic Chem Lab is basically a lot of work with no return whatsoever. Her lectures and the instruction manual covered the basics of the material covered. But for the quizzes, post-labs and lab reports, you had to know how to apply all these concepts that she covered theoretically. Fay is a great lecturer and if you go to office hours it becomes apparent that she can explain everything to you. If you can't go to office hours though, you're kinda fucked. I had to teach myself how to interpret NMR spectra (and even if you think you know how to do that from Orgo Lectures, trust me, you don't) and how to write a ""proper"" chemistry paper. The grading is also insanely nitpicky -- the average on the quizzes and post-labs never got above 12/15, and you could lose points on the most insignificant aspects (defining one peak, out of your 10!, as a multiplet instead of as a doublet of doublets). The worst part? I still need to google ""IR absorption table"" or look up the ChemDraw structure of molecules to be able to figure out their spectra. One would assume that putting in over 10 hours of work on each lab report (and some of the post-labs!!!) would result in some sort of lasting knowledge. One would, however, be mistaken.
Very rarely is it possible to directly pinpoint the source of all your anxiety and suffering. For me, this was Intensive Organic Chemistry Lab.

If you're wondering whether or not to take a class with Professor Breyer DO IT. Just do it. He is one of the kindest professors I have ever met and genuinely cares about his students to a degree that I have yet to see in any other professor. I had Prof. Breyer for First Year Seminar at Barnard and, thanks to him, I feel much more comfortable in a seminar setting and in writing college-level essays. He is encouraging but also honest and gives good guidance, and if you have any questions or are just plain confused, Breyer is always willing to meet with you for as long or as often as you need. I think that some people are put off by his somewhat awkward demeanor, but, in my opinion, that just makes him all the more genuine and approachable. And, if nothing else, he has some pretty crazy and hilarious life stories that are 100% worth your time. I feel very lucky to have had Professor Breyer, especially in my first year, and would recommend him to everyone. 

Workload:
Pretty fair. There are a decent amount of readings and 2 essays as well as a research project, but everything is definitely manageable. Also, if you have personal stuff going on or are just completely overwhelmed with work, Breyer is usually willing to make adjustments as necessary.

Professor Ackley is an extremely warm and kind person and a great lecturer. He definitely knows how and when to joke around, and he's not pretentious or intimidating at all. For me, his lectures went at a good pace, not to fast or slow, and were interesting, detailed, and helped me prepare for his exams. He was very attentive to students needs and always provided as much information as relevant/possible in his lectures and elsewhere. I feel confident in my knowledge of the material covered throughout the course and would recommend him to anyone interested in taking an Art History course. (Also, Prof. Ackley has to be the most polite teacher I have ever had. He always apologized for inconveniences and thanked his students for their patience. )

Michael is the single most enthusiastic professor I have had at Columbia. Not only does he commute back and forth from BOSTON every week, but he also prepares his lectures extremely thoroughly as not to waste students' time. He takes the time to sit down with each student outside of class to talk with them about their essays, too, and sets multiple deadlines so that students can improve their work before it is submitted as a final, polished draft. He also was the first professor I've had at Columbia who made any effort to put the Core in context of it's inherent flaws, calling out its focus on white male scholars and inserting the voices of other groups where appropriate (without tokenizing said groups).

I always thought the Middle Ages was a dead period, but I couldn't have been more wrong.  This class was so interesting, and Professor Kaye is a great lecturer—he is clear and concise.  The workload is manageable, but there are a lot of secondary sources to read, increasing both in length and amount as the semester goes on.  The discussion sections are helpful because the paragraph assignments force you to read the text closer, which helped on exams.  If you do the primary source readings and the more important secondary source readings, as well as pay attention in class, you should do well.  But while it is doable, it is a harder Intro class than the other European history ones (Renaissance and Modern).

Professor Stokes is a great professor.  I thought she was a little harsh for the first few weeks, but she warmed up to us by the end of September.  She is a really smart woman and is understanding about different learning styles.  Professor Stokes uses a lot of diagrams, and they are really helpful.  As for the exams, she assigns 2 take home essays per midterm, one of them being extra credit.  It is foolish to not do the second essay, because it helps you get a handle on some of the topics, and it can boost your grade if you're not a great test-taker.

I really liked Dr. Ramsey for a few reasons: first, her class is very clearly structured: she posts discussions questions for each reading to respond to on Courseworks, and that's what you spend a good portion of the class talking about the next day. She also comes up with pretty cool activities to go with each reading. She definitely helped me understand the books a lot better. Also, she is definitely one of the nicest teachers I've had at Columbia: she's really funny, cares about her students, and actually spends the money that the Core office earmarks for us on a game night, outings, and museum trips.  
The grading as far as I know, isn't too bad. It's more than possible to get A's on the papers. She also gave us a curve on our midterm  which isn't too bad. Also, if you don't do well on your papers then she actually provides a lot of feedback that can help you improve. Her feedback is actually really helpful and will help you get a better grade if you follow it.

Approach with caution. Class may seem relaxed but then the midterm is very difficult- it was way too long for 75min, convoluted, and there was no partial credit on math parts. With a class with only around 20 students total, the grades were ridiculously harsh. To put this in perspective, I actually earned the same grade on the midterm in a Columbia finance course... 
The material in the course is presented in a very disorganized, wordy way and is difficult to follow. There's no textbook or powerpoints so it makes learning the material a challenge. 
For those who said they enjoyed the policy brief- well they must really enjoy writing because this is an extensive project that is worth 30% of your grade. It has to be 2000 words or less (6-10 double spaced pages).  In addition you have to present the paper to the class. On top of this there is a final that is cumulative. 
Attendance is not required, but if you want to have any idea of the material you need for exams, there is no way you can skip. 
The debate was by far the most annoying part of this course. Each student gets assigned a debate with 1 or 2 other people and has to talk in depth about pretty difficult topics. Also, he doesn't say it, but it is graded.

If you want your Greek to improve, take a class with Prof Scharffenberger. If you want to feel confident and comfortable translating, digesting, and analyzing 1000+ lines of text per week, take survey with her. She KNOWS her stuff. She is well organized, punctual, fair, and extremely demanding - but in a way that is positive and constructive for the student. My weakest point was having the confidence [and honestly, the skill] to discuss the material, especially in such a small class, but Prof Scharffenberger was kind and did not put anyone on the spot. There were no surprises. She was accommodating with her office hours, offered guidance for writing the two short papers, and in addition to discussing the text, gave some brief grammar and meter lessons.
Also, it was great to walk into class and be greeted by her smiling and being excited to start the lesson. Small things like that really change the atmosphere of a classroom.

Julia is a bit disorganized sometimes but really cool and worth it. At first, you'll probably be annoyed because P1 is so restrictive by nature of P1 and the grading is a bit harsher (Julia lightens up as the semester goes on, so don't stress about it, even if you get something in the B range), but by the end, if you put the work in, you'll be totally fine. 
One of the fun things about this class is that in our section we got a lot of choices to write about whatever we wanted as long as it loosely fit in with the readings, so you can find a way to connect essays to whatever you're interested in. If you're not interested in anything on the planet, then yes, you'll be bored, but if you've got literally any interests at all, you'll be able to find something that interests you to write about and it won't be that hard. Most of the readings are really engaging, so that part of the class is good too.
Definitely GO TO MEETINGS!! Julia's a great person to talk to and it will make edits on essays so much easier than just paper feedback. I thought I'd really hate this class but I really like it. A lot of people hate UW as a thing, which makes me really thankful I had Julia.

It is hard to explain how amazing a TA Patrick Quinlivan is. If he was was teaching a higher level chemistry course I would seriously consider taking it even though it would be unrelated to my major, simply because he would make it super interesting, fun, and understandable. I typically don't pay attention in Parkin's lectures and just read his lecture slides at a later date. Most of what I have learned in this class though is simply from attending Patrick's recitation sections. You would have to be crazy to skip one. He goes over the hardest parts of the lecture and makes them crystal clear and easy to understand. He does a good job of writing his thought process on the board in great detail for the first one, then slowly cutting back as he does more examples. He does a good balance of teaching the material, and doing example questions. He clearly has worked with Parkin for a while now as Patrick seems to know where Parkin falls short in teaching and fills in well during recitation. One week Patrick went out of order relative to Parkin's lecture so he could explain the next weeks material that was complicated so the next lecture (a more complex one) would make more sense. He does a good job of answering questions, and from what I know of my friends who have asked him for help in office hours he is as fantastic then too. I have talked to him after recitation on multiple equations asking about chemistry stuff semi-unrelated to the material simply out of curiosity and he has always taken the time to answer my questions thoughtfully. Lastly, he always has either an Irish football (soccer) shirt or sweatshirt on.
Can't say enough great things about Patrick. He is the only Teacher/TA that I will miss from this semester. If you are in Parkin's class, sending you luck in getting Patrick as your TA

A very interesting topic and manageable class; however, the emphasis on poor policy and lack of understanding of drugs amid even scientists themselves seemed to simply contribute to the hysteria he so ardently opposes. Takeaway from the class: nothing the media prints, no studies previously done on drugs are reliable and factual except his (even though in some cases only a handful of participants are studied). Every drug has predictable effects and so our basic understanding of drugs as a society is flawed. Just complete hysteria and exaggeration serves as the underlying current for the course and this to me went against the critical thinking he advocated so much for. With this said, lectures are engaging and the topic is interesting. He is also inspiring, as the light he shines on flawed policy and marginalization of minorities is extremely important and interesting. However, get ready to read his memoir and textbook written by his very own self and to regurgitate what is sad in lecture on the exams. For a professor who pretends he cares so much, he is unresponsive by email, which was disappointing. His celebrity status is important to him, in case you're curious.

This class was great.  I'm not sure what the previous post takes an issue with?  Maybe they had their feelings hurt for not getting an A.  There are no gimme A's here at Columbia, so that is what I think the problem below is; they got an A- and wanted to vent because they didn't get the slackers A they thought.  
The class was great, the conversations were great.  We dealt with real Bioethical issues and worked them in a variety of ways.  Dr. Loike poses the issue and essentially moderates the discussion.  Don't get your feelings hurt because he steers the conversation in another direction, there is no ego in Science.
The textbook is inexpensive and easy to follow.  If you read and actually have meaningful input, you will get an A.  He is not out to hurt your grades and just don't shovel garbage at him and you will do well.  The grades are not subjective, he gives you plenty of opportunities to earn the A.  So be it, you are a slacker, you pull down an A-.  I just find it hard that in the Bio world to come on here and talk poorly of a Professor who encourages you to really think and utilize critical thinking skills.  
The science we discussed was all cutting edge advancements and really pushed the boundaries of ethics.  Keeping in mind that this is largely a discussion class, if you are an introvert, do well on the assignments and when you do speak up-offer crisp and insightful feedback and you won't have to worry about participation being an issue.

This is the first year in which Orgo lab has become a full year sequence. Thus, the course was at a much more reasonable pace than that described by previous reviewers! It may explain the difference between their experience of Anna and mine. 
Anna is a good lecturer, clear on expectations, and amiable with her students. While she may come across as brusque if you try to ask questions on Piazza that were already answered in lecture or in a handout, she is actually doing this to help you learn. I found myself learning concepts INCREDIBLY well in this course, and it was very enjoyable. Of course the TAs play a huge part in this as well. Go to TA office hours!

So this class was pretty much hell on earth, to be honest. It sucks because the material was actually pretty interesting but the professor was just not the best. I know this has been said before on other reviews for Fleischer but I got As on most of my essays in high school and my first two essays (out of three) I got Cs. I'm fighting for a B in the class which is just not where I want to be my first semester of college. The prof gives weird feedback and hates passive verbs (seriously they are her enemy) but when I go to her office hours she just asks me a bunch of questions about my work and doesn't answer my questions. She's actually pretty nice during class time but then I keep getting these horrible grades and not improving. It's very frustrating. I just feel like she hasn't taught me how to write better, which defeats the purpose of first year writing.
Workload:
Three essays (two of them were 4-6 pages and the final paper is 6-8 pages). Reading for every class, rarely difficult. One provocation, it was not hard.  The essays are the hardest part, especially because they are worth so much of your grade and she's such a harsh grader. A couple of opportunities for extra credit.

This class was really interesting because of my interests in Latin American culture and American and Latin American literature. I think this course would appeal to anyone with interests in these fields and related fields, or anyone who simply is not interested in the legacy of the Mediterranean...This course was something I could relate to and apply to in my daily life.
To be honest I barely did any of the reading. Just make sure you read what you are interested in because you do have to write a few papers, and you'll need something to write about. Consider doing the presentation on what you think you will be interested in so you don't have to do as much of the reading, and you will have back ground info for your paper.
Professor Morris has been super helpful to me, some others feel otherwise, but I think that if you put in the work and you are open to feedback and proactive, she can be very helpful. Her edits on papers are really helpful and the assignments help you figure out how you can improve your work.

Professor Mansfield is one of the nicest professors you will ever meet. She has such a calming presence and is truly angelic. I had her for both Molecular & Mendelian Genetics and Development, and in both courses she was so clearly passionate about what she was teaching and helps make everyone in the class be excited about the material. The content in combination with her teaching made this class my favorite class I've ever taken at Barnard.
Developmental biology is an amazing field for anyone interested in genetics and molecular biology, but it also touches upon evolution and environmental effects. This course is also great for anyone hoping to learn to read scientific papers better. The material is very detailed but also interesting, and Prof. Mansfield is very clear about what she expects you to know. She emphasizes the concepts and understanding the material on a deep level as opposed to memorizing specific examples. Overall, she is just a really wonderful and extremely clear professor. 
There is a textbook for the course but Prof. Mansfield will never test you on anything you didn't go over in class. The textbook is useful for when you want to look at something in greater detail for your own intellectual curiosity, but you won't spend hours a week reading the textbook or anything like that. You can definitely do well in this class by just studying the lecture material really well.

I immediately dropped his class within the shop period. I had hoped that his Introduction to Statistics without Calculus wouldn't be complicated, but I was wrong. His lessons were incredibly rushed. His homework almost seemed unrelated and too much in comparison to what we had accomplished during the shop period. He made us use excel (which I usually have no objections to) but did not teach us or tell us how to use certain functions necessary. Any questions that were asked were not answered well and he seemed condescending about us not knowing the material well. He told us we didn't really even need the textbook and that we could technically use any statistics textbook. He only had 1 TA with very limited office hours. In summary, his class was unorganized and he gave off the feeling that he did not plan ahead too much.

Colgrove himself is a wonderful lecturer. Whether you complete all the reading or not, his lectures give a comprehensive view of the points made throughout the reading. Not only does he teach us the history of public health, but he also keeps the class interactive and relatable by interspersing it with videos and images and tying it back to how these public health policies relate to or affect us now. We've done class debates and a simulation of what immigrants would go through at Ellis Island, all of which were very fun!
The time of the class may or may not work for most, as it's 8:40 in the morning (or at least when I took it). However, I still strongly recommend this class nonetheless.
The workload is managebale, although some of the readings were 40-100 pages total; however, the papers are skimmable and you learn to find what main points to look for in terms of looking at the development of certain public health issues.
There are two papers (a midterm paper and final paper), both of which are manageable. The TAs are very helpful in writing these, though I would suggest going beforehand rather than starting it the day before the due date. Their office hours really helped save my grade for one of the papers. There is a discussion session for this class.

Elizabeth Auran is a goddess. She is thoughtful, kind, brilliant, and supportive. She will take your writing and help you mold it into something to be proud of and will make you think of literature in a new way. Taking Women & Culture with her is a truly Barnard experience and one I'm so happy to have had. If you can take a class with her, do it. 
As far as class goes, she assigns difficult texts but ones that she will help you unpack. Class is discussion based and she holds back from over-sharing her own analysis. She grades based on participation partially, and so it is in your best interest to participate - but also you will want to talk. She stimulates fascinating discussion and pulls in background from other disciplines. She also studies Biblical texts, and brings that context into some of the texts. 
She dedicates a huge amount of time to editing essays. She does the most intensive edits I've seen FYW professors do, and they were incredibly helpful to me. Auran will also meet with you for every draft, and first drafts aren't graded on quality.

Elizabeth Auran is by far the best english teacher I have ever had. She is incredibly supportive and friendly, and I can honestly say that my writing improved in her class.

This course is primarily focused on improving critical writing skills through historical analysis and comparison, and there could be no better teacher for it than Professor Kaye! Because he's primarily a medieval historian, a lot of his anecdotes trail off into the 1200-1400s but I always found them kind of instructive in showing you a new way to look at the world and how we create history. Professor Kaye is incredibly approachable and makes class discussion insightful and engaging. Be prepared to work though because he expects a lot from you and is always invested in your growth as a student. I've had some papers that he refused to grade(let alone read)  because I just slapped something on the paper and he didn't think it was reflective of the quality of writing I had submitted in the past.

Professor Denef is very nice and will answer whatever questions you have. He's very responsive to emails and sends detailed replies to homework questions.

The homeworks typically have nothing to do with anything Denef talks (or rather, mumbles about) in class, and you will be teaching yourself the vast majority of the material from the textbook. When the homework is easy this isn't a problem but as the class gets more and more conceptual and the mental leaps you have to make are greater, this becomes very frustrating.

Taking Professor Levy's class this semester was one of the best decisions I made for this semester! This course is not only fascinating, but Professor Levy's enthusiasm regarding the material makes each and every lecture an engaging adventure. I love that the course examines both Jewish texts as well as other texts from the time period in order to help us better understand the interplay between each of the religions from a literary standpoint. 
Aside from being really engaging, Professor Levy is an extremely kind person and a very approachable professor when it comes to discussing anything from the papers she assigns to something from class you either didn't understand or want to further discuss.  
This class does fulfill the Global Core requirement, but is worth taking whether you need those credits or not. As someone who didn't need to fulfill their Global Core requirement, I still found myself thoroughly enjoying what this class had to offer. 
Workload:
This course is very reading heavy, but the readings happen to be quite interesting and are often discussed in class. Aside from the readings, there is no other homework assignments. 
The class has 2 papers-- one that is 4-6 pages and one that is 6-8 pages. The 4-6 page paper is due pretty early in the semester, and the 6-8 page paper is due on the last day of class. Professor Levy gives detailed instructions as to what she expects in each paper and is always willing to have a conference about it if you need to discuss the specifics of your topic or want to get feedback on your essay.
There is also a midterm and final. Both have short answer, an essay, and T/F or fill in the blank type questions. Both are meant to be completed in a 75 minute period (Prof. Levy told us that we only needed to come in at the regular class time for the final and that the two exams were about the same length). The exam is totally doable if you do the readings and prepare well.

I believe that Professor Vandenburg is very good at explaining concepts in a way that makes them easy to understand, but there are certain times where she mentions points that are not necessarily covered in class and are sometimes hard to understand if you don't have the basis down already. That being said, she is very open to meeting and discussing papers and concepts during her office hours.

This class is GREAT! 
Very interesting, not very demanding, class. 
It's a wonderful course that really stimulates your mind.
I learned many new terms that help me understand my experience in an academic context.
I can now better explain my practical observations and I know what are the conditions that are essential to enable innovation!
The professor is full of interesting stories that help understand the material and his lectures are very interactive. The examples help you think about the subject discussed. I like the way he explains a concept with a combination of abstract ideas and very concrete examples.
The students are expected to participate and contribute to the class content with questions and examples. Its suitable for students who like to think seriously and participate in classes and discussion sections.

Workload:
There is a lot of reading materials, most of them are very light (NY Times articles) and very interesting. 
You should send a short response of the reading every week, but you don't really need to actually read all of them.
There is a take-home mid-term that requires some thinking, but its 2 short essay questions and a final paper you can write about whatever you want.

Robert McCaughey seems like a very interesting professor, but unfortunately that does not come through in his class. For every major text that we speed through, you have to write an essay and a critique in which he obsesses over your essay title. I found all of our texts really interesting (a word that he insists you do not use) and the essays that were written was thought-provoking and a perfect set-up to an engaging class discussions. But to my disappointment, he would stifle discussion when we got to class. I am sure that he would be a great history professor, but in my experience as a seminar professor, he is very dry. My class was full of passionate, avid readers but every class was very quiet after the first few classes.

Briefly: Take Professor Pedatella's class if you want a teacher who is passionate and highly knowledgable. Do not take him if you're looking for an easy A, though doing well is not impossible--you just have to put in some work. 
Each class period is completely discussion based, and Prof does a really good job of facilitating this discussion. He encourages participation on behalf of all students, but will not pressure you to speak if you are not comfortable doing so. He is adept at building off each student's comment and bringing in interesting information, historical context, or references to the intertextual conversation that we aren't able to pick up on. As someone incredibly well read and versed in the history, he is able to make the texts come alive. When he reads passages aloud in class, you can't help but be excited about the readings, since his passion radiates. Prof also brought a completely new perspective to analyzing texts, and on many occasions, I left class with a completely new perspective on our reading. 
He tries to make time for each student during office hours, setting out 15-minute blocks for which students can register. If he is not busy helping students with their essays, he is more than happy to meet for longer periods of time to talk about any aspect of literature in which you may be interested.

Andre Burgstaller has said SO MANY inappropriate, unprofessional, ignorant, and bigoted things over the course of this semester (in FYS Economic Life and Human Character). He has recommended that a student see a therapist, lectured the class on (antiquated, incorrect, and hurtful) ""homosexual identities,"" and made inappropriate comments and assumptions about students' cultural, racial, and familial backgrounds. He spends an insane amount of class time lecturing about things that are often tangentially related to the content, so we rarely got through the content, including when students were presenting. There is an insane amount of reading that is often dense, but few essays with literally NO prompt - just ""write something related!"" He is a Marxist and brings back almost every single topic to Marxism and workers rights somehow, regardless of what the people in the class are centering as what they're interested in or see as important. I continually felt challenged in this class - but ideologically, not academically. He said so many things and argued so many points that conflicted with my worldview, and often responded to my disagreement in a way that felt minimizing and as though he was not listening or understanding what I said. But this class was incredibly amusing. We were never bored.

Intro to Organismal and Evolutionary Biology is definitely not the class for you if you don't read textbooks. There is a lot of information you are expected to know for each test, but all of it is in the book. I attend his lectures just to get an overview of what I will be reading about so I have a little something to guide my reading, but the lectures are completely unnecessary if you do the reading, as everything he says in class is directly from the book (he wrote the book). 
The material is super neat though, and it is pretty well organized. Overall a great survey class that isn't too intense as long as you read and make quizlets/flashcards/study guides for all the chapters so you can cram the night before the test.

I loved this course. Professor Haider is an incredibly engaging professor, encourages students to think critically, and is very passionate about this subject. Some students think he's mean, but his tough style is what makes him a great professor that keeps class interesting and encourages students to always participate.

Dr. J, as he prefers you call him, is a bit of an enigma in the Barnard chemistry department. While a lot of people have a strong aversion to him, I have grown to be ""okay"" with him. 
He is the director of the BC2001 gen chem lab, meaning he teaches pre-lab (recitation) and some of the actual lab classes (I had him as one of my instructors). I really appreciated his concision and knowledgeability in pre-lab lectures. He knows what he is trying to say, he says it very well, and he answers questions, albeit in a smart ass way, vey well. He isn't a lovely dovey guy in lab and won't tell you exactly what to do or answer any basic questions that you should already know before entering lab, but he will help you if something goes completely wrong in your experiment and he will answer small questions here and there. His demonstrations of the lab are very concise and make perfect sense, which I couldn't say for the other lab instructor in my class.
Most people dislike the guy because of the grading though (he doesn't directly grade your lab reports, but he is in charge of the rubrics the reports are graded off of). I found that the quality of your actual lab report (you record data in your lab and then write the report at home and the report is due at the beginning of recitation the next week) doesn't matter much; the grading is mainly focused on the quality of your data. It can really suck if you aren't good at procedure, but if you try your best it will mostly all even out. There are lab office hours every day which are extremely helpful and I am surprised more people don't attend. 
This class is hard as hell in some aspects, but it really won't be the worst experience of you college career. I would recommend taking this course over Columbia chem just because of all the resources available to you in the Barnard chem department and the better quality of teaching (they will really help you understand the material if you put in the work to do so, even if you are not a super chem student ((like me)) ).

Karen is an amazing professor! She is very thorough, extremely knowledgable, and wants to help you improve your French. This class was reading-heavy and, as the name suggests, analysis heavy. We spent a significant amount of time learning/going over analysis techniques.Since this was the first year the course was offered, it will probably change a little, but the course was broken into units based on type of literature (poetry, prose, theatre). I would strongly suggest this class to anyone looking to work on their literature analysis or improve their French writing and reading. It's a great intermediate class if you want to get your French skills polished a bit before jumping into more intense literature/film classes.

Catherine gives great feedback on her essays, though sometimes it will take a bit for her to return the essay. She is not an easy grader, but I think she is very fair. It is definitely a bit of a crapshoot on the first essay, but after that you will have a really good idea of what she is looking for.

Professor Carnes' US History class is a must take class at Barnard.  For every class, he was always passionate, engaging, and enthusiastic  Reading quotes from primary sources and asking questions about what the students do given the same information the decision makers had at that time, he truly makes history come alive.  
Readings are not that much are not necessarily to do well on his exams.  Solely paying attention during his lectures, which is easy to do given how engaging and interactive they are, will prepare the students well for the exams.

However, he isn't particularly timely in returning work, which can be particularly frustrating for compositions which you are asked to revise often with a class or two as turn around time. Additionally, every semester I have taken his class he has fallen behind. Instead of eliminating a test or presentation when we are out of time, he crams them in at the end of the semester.

Switch out if you can. Professor Ladenson will explictly let you know that she is irritated by anything and everything that you do. She will ramble and lose track of what she is saying, not delving into any analysis of any sorts beyond asking students to reread passages of the texts to then go off on a tangent about some piece of literature she is familiar with. You will be on her good side by coming into the class having learned Greek and with knowledge of the gods and goddesses of Greek mythology. Her midterm destroyed me. She claimed to be encouraging me to come to her office hours. However, she purposely tended to find faults in whatever I discussed, or whatever I wrote in my papers. She never gave ideas to help improve the content of the paper, but only got irritated if you wrote not as ""normal people do."" As a result, I, among others, was left clueless in how to improve.

Dan is an encyclopedia. He seems to be familiar with the literature, history, and philosophy (academia, culture... you name it) of any time period and geographic region in any field. I feel like I become smarter by just being around him. 
Dan's teaching style is fairly consistent. He poses questions, allows people to respond, and each time summarizes their responses in much more eloquent terms that make it easy to follow the authors' arguments. He is genuinely intellectually curious, which means sometimes he entertains questions that stray outside the texts and may take away from class time that can help us understand the writing itself (something that is often hard to do). However, I still feel like his class has given me a great foundation in our readings. 
He is super available (always willing to meet, even if not in office hours), and his comments on graded work are always super detailed. He also asked for our own anonymous feedback at the midpoint of the course, and I have noticed changes (for the better) that have likely been in response to our suggestions. He clearly cares a lot about his students, and this translates to enthusiasm for his class (never have I consistently gathered with friends after a class to rehash its goings on, but I do after this every M/W for lunch). He is also remarkably personal. It's almost become a game amongst our class to wheedle details of his personal life out of him just because he's so candid and funny.

I have now had the pleasure/misfortune of taking Professor Panayotidi for three courses (two of which fell in the same semester). I can say with confidence that this was the worst one yet. Professor Panayotidi runs it like a continuation of Structural Design whereas it seems like it is meant to be a comprehensive semester-long project that builds off of the course material covered in Structural Design. Because of this, it effectively becomes both. Like Structural Design, this course is divided down the middle: pre-midterm material focuses on steel and post-midterm material focuses on concrete. The key difference between this course and Structural Design, as made evident in the name, is the project. 
Early on in the semester, Professor Panayotidi spends an entire lecture introducing the project by tediously going through the parameters set forth by the National Student Steel Bridge Competition. Yet he does little to emphasize which rules are most relevant to our project and he says nothing of what he expects going forward (especially with regard to scheduling). As such, this project quickly faded into the back of my mind. It only became real once Professor Panayotidi announced that he expected a midterm presentation to discuss what we've prepared thus far, sending the students into a collective frenzy. My group pulled an all nighter to prepare a semi-functional bridge. After presentations, it again faded from our minds (and so too, it seemed from Professor Panayotidi's). As the end of the semester approached, this project reared its ugly head once more. I put in 20+ hours over the course of four days to work out all the complexities of the bridge design (which had only recently been specified by Panayotidi as essential components). Not to mention we only ever met a single time in the computer lab for Professor Panayotidi to offer his input--and this was two days before our final presentations. 
Because so little guidance was given on this project, you might expect Professor Panayotidi to be lenient in his critique of your presentation. That, however, was not the case. Professor Panayotidi was quick to attack any missing consideration or false assumption. Not to mention he brought Adrian Brugger with him for both the midterm and final presentations. Adrian was certainly more constructive with his criticism but it was still hard to stomach (even if you weren't the group being torn to shreds!). 
Oh and forget about the quality of lectures at the end of the semester. Once your focus is on the bridge project, Professor Panayotidi more often defers to presenting via projector. Some topics are best presented through the projector, but complex concrete design is not one of them. 
All in all, this was probably the most stressful class I've taken at Columbia. Not because the course material is impossibly difficult, but because Professor Panayotidi just isn't clear. He isn't clear with what he expects for the semester project and, after a certain point, his lectures are equally unclear.

Adam is a fantastic UW professor. Engaging during class, approachable after class, and his comments are usually helpful and constructive.
Initially, I was worried the Sustainable Development section would be a preachy liberal shit-fest, but I turned out to be wrong (about Adam at least). The readings were engaging and varied to the point it didn't feel like we were covering the same thing all semester.
Workload is similar to most other UW classes, but luckily the readings are typically short and don't include literature by anybody who died over two centuries ago.
He is also a fair grader and will not hesitate to help struggling students. ASK FOR HELP IF YOU NEED IT!
Take Adam's section of UW, you won't regret it. 
P.S.
If you regret it, you're probably just a really shitty writer who ignored his comments.

American Transcendentalism is a new course that comprises an intensive reading of Emerson, Thoreau, and Dickinson. About half the semester was spent on Emerson, followed by three weeks on Thoreau and two weeks on Dickinson. Prof. Arsić provided historical context for each author and suggested secondary readings, but by and large the course centered on analyzing the primary texts themselves.
While the course was technically a seminar, Prof. Arsić gave long exegeses of each text, which were particularly illuminating for Emerson and Thoreau. There was student participation, but it was not the central focus of the class.
Because two of our classes were cancelled, the number of classes on Dickinson was cut short. Perhaps because of this condensation, Prof. Arsić's analysis of her poetry was not at the same level of her explanations of Emerson and Thoreau.
Prof. Arsić was accessible throughout the semester in office hours, even to us undergraduates. She also read drafts of our midterm papers and gave detailed comments on the final version.
I highly recommend the course to students interested in the 19th century, which, by the way, is much more interesting than the 20th. I also recommend Prof. Arsić. She is wonderfully kind and engaging, and her knowledge of ante-bellum America is astounding.
Workload:
The reading load was completely manageable, although the section on Thoreau involved reading two 300-page books back to back. For Emerson, it was a few essays per class. For Dickinson, it was about 30 poems.
Papers: Three short responses (1-2 pages) to whichever readings you like; a midterm paper (5-7 pages); a final paper (6-8 pages).

Prof. Avgousti is an excellent Core Lecturer. He clearly conceives of himself not only as an academic but also as an educator. His classes are entertaining, and he provides a clear analysis of each text. In contrast to Lit Hum, CC requires some instruction and exegesis, which he provides well. He is incredibly responsive to email and engages well during office hours. He has thought seriously about his pedagogy and enacts it well.
Prof. Avgousti often spent between 15 and 45 minutes lecturing, which I found interesting and helpful to my understanding of each text. He was adept at managing discussions, which were generally strong, although not mind-blowing. On the whole, it's not a mind-blowing class. But it is an engaging class, and it's one from which you'll walk away with a strong understanding of each text, an ability to write about works of philosophy, and a measured approach to discussion.

Professor Pagano is a sweet man and enthusiastic about the content and his students. It's clear that he loves what he does and he often uses the class to discuss the importance of the texts to students' own lives and college journeys. He's especially great if you're a creative person because he is very supportive of the artistic life and praises it often. The readings are almost always interesting and fun and he does a really good job of having recurrent themes appear through different readings. That being said I always got a weird ~vibe~ from him. He never did anything inappropriate, but just made me uncomfortable with some of his feminist and psychosexual analysis of the works. He's never really said or done anything to really be labelled creepy, but it's also worth noting that I wasn't the only student who felt this way. Ultimately, Professor Pagano is a great teacher and the class is really interesting, he just made me uncomfortable sometimes.

READINGS AND FREEWRITES: Due every class. The length of readings can vary greatly but the longer selections are usually novels and not too difficult to get through/skim. The freewrites are literally one page responses (I usually hand wrote something that took up most of one side of lined paper)to the reading. You really don't have to worry about structuring you're thoughts, just write whatever's on your mind after doing the reading.
ESSAYS-There are three essays. For each one you get several prompts to choose from and they all ended up being about 5 pages for me. For all of the essays you also get to have a peer editor and him look at it before submitting the final copy. (He says this isn't true with the last essay, but he literally just let me do this).
He's pretty understanding about absences and extensions but the class is small and the discussions are really important to attend if you want to do well.

I had Dr. Greenberg for Art Hum. 
Dr. Greenberg is a great instructor to have for Art Hum. As someone who did not know a lot about art, I felt like my contributions were always welcomed and valued, even if they kind of missed the mark. 
His style of teaching art hum is a bit different from other professors (from what I've heard). He taught the class primarily through discussion. We did not have to memorize names, dates, or works of art. There were no quizzes; I listed the total workload below. The course was not stressful at all, the workload was light compared to other classes.
For the final, he sent us six questions, three of which were on the exam. Two of the questions on the exam were submitted by us, the students. 
He only teaches one section a semester, so if by some chance you end up in his class stay there. Would highly recommend him.

Professor McWhorter would be a great tour guide. He is endearing, funny, but he doesn't give much content. I could have learned this ENTIRE semester in 2 hours maximum. My friend said that ""he's like icing without the cupcake."" It was very frustrating to sit through over an hour of maybe two sentences of actual content that I could take notes on and think over later. Linguistics is a fascinating field to me, but this course was a waste of my time.
Examples: the class on syntax was simply examples drawn on the board with ZERO explanations given. The TAs would grade differently based on what they knew, and one TA would tell me an answer while another TA would mark it wrong on my homework. The class on writing systems felt like an abstract on Wikipedia where McWhorter clearly didn’t even open any of the content portions of the page. We learned more about his love life in college than about sociolinguistics. 
It's also strangely difficult. Review sessions are a MUST (they give all the answers) before the midterm and final. The homeworks are difficult and must be done by a consensus vote of 20-30 people. Go to office hours (or find out what happened in office hours from your 20-30 friends), but you may still get the question wrong if the TA from office hours isn't the same TA that graded your homework.
TLDR: This class is a waste of your time. Read a book on it and spend your tuition money on something *anything* else. If you really want McWhorter's comedy, then watch his TED talk, which he'll play for you during class anyways because he can't be bothered to teach you.

This was one of my favorite courses, if not my favorite, I've taken at Barnard. Reynolds seems genuinely interested in, and even affected by, students' views. He is not pretentious but will tell you when you're wrong. His passion for art history, no matter what period, seeps into every discussion. He pushes you to write succinctly and clearly. Not only did this class provide me with both in-depth and broad perspectives of the art historical field, but it also taught me to consolidate information, summarize, and debate with classmates. I also appreciated how he made weekly papers due on Mondays and graded them by class time on Tuesdays; this provided structure and forced us to be prepared for discussion.

Professor Loike was great!  The class was discussion based and the workload was very manageable.  I am not sure what the issue is with the reviewer below is, but I felt the class was a blast.  The class was pretty straight forward and although he challenges you to speak up and participate in class, he acts more like a moderator steering the conversation towards some sort of conclusion.
There were several guests speakers who offered creative and interesting discussion points for us.  Professor Loike made the class enjoyable and helped us probe in depth some very ethical issues facing the scientific community.  The class is an easy A/A-.  Show up, do your work, and offer solid feedback every so often and you will take home an A.
Well worth the time and a nice break from the rugged science track we take.  I wish that he had more course offerings, hopefully if I get into Physicians and Surgeons I can take one of his courses.

This is an awesome course to take for seniors in systems track. It teaches you a rare but useful skill -- reverse engineering binaries -- while drawing a little bit from everything you've learned during your time at Columbia. There's a little bit of networks, operating systems, compilers, AP (C language), fundamentals, ... if you can name it, you will probably use it at some point in this class. It's a fantastic way to tie together all your CS knowledge and feel like a l33t haxx0r at the same time.
The other cool thing is that the course is taught by researchers/investigators at Mandiant. This is the company that investigated when the New York Times and Sony got hacked. You're learning from the best in the world -- the professor literally wrote the book on reverse engineering. He and his guest lecturers had some pretty interesting war stories to share from their investigations.
Lectures are very dry, but they follow the book pretty closely so you always have that as a fallback if you have trouble paying attention. If I were in charge of the course, I would speed through the lectures and spend that time on demos / story time instead. This is because the vast majority of students are undergrad seniors or MS students, so they already know what a kernel does or how virtual memory works.
Workload:
Workload was unexpectedly heavy -- about 1 homework per week (excluding breaks and holidays). It's always hands-on: you get a bunch of binaries to pull apart and answer questions. The time to complete each one was highly variable: some weeks I was done in 3 hours, other times it took me over 12 hours to figure it out. They expect a bit of detail when you answer the questions.
The midterm was not very useful. Too many questions exclusively tested whether you remembered random bits of information given in lecture, like what the PE magic number stands for (it's the creator's initials), or whether ASCII and Unicode strings are printed separately by a particular program. There was one short reverse engineering problem on the exam and it was trivial.
There's both a final project and a final exam. The project is a more open-ended version of the homework that you can work on with a partner. You have to write a report and you don't get leading questions to point you in the right direction.

Security Architecture is a great idea for a course, but I don't like how such an important topic gets watered down so much. In lecture, we just go over a bunch of security concepts like permissions and buffer overflows at a high level. Prof. Bellovin seems to avoid going into technical details when possible, so the lectures are not very information dense. (When I miss class, I usually watch at 1.25x and that speed feels about right.) Some lectures, Prof. Bellovin brings out his funny side and cracks a bunch of jokes, which is pretty nice.
Workload:
Workload: very light. Only 4 homeworks. The three programming assignments remind me of labs in AP. We used C or C++ to implement some security-critical toy program like a print spooler or a command parser/sanitizer. These were kind of interesting, but I think it would be more fun if we knew that the graders would try to exploit our programs instead of grading them based on a checklist of features / requirements. In the last one, we get a binary and are told to attack it (more open ended). 
I didn't like the way the homeworks were bunched up at the end. We nearly got through the first half of the semester without turning in anything.

This is a super interesting class for those interested in learning how everyday image processing algorithms work. It provides a comprehensive survey of vision algorithms from the ground up: from lenses and sensors (hi, photographers!) to basic 2d stuff to algorithms that reconstruct depth from multiple points of view to neural nets in the last lecture. With Deep Learning(TM) being billed as the one algorithm to rule them all, it was interesting to see how many simple, interpretable models have good performance without less complexity and faster run times.
Prof. Nayar's lectures are fun and engaging -- he applies his sense of humor and PowerPoint animation skillz to make CV easier to learn. You don't need any books since the slides have all the formulas, derivations, and examples you need to do homework. (I wish we could get electronic copies of the slides, since it's in a computer **vision** class, sometimes you need to see the colors in a diagram/picture for things to make sense. And videos in the slides are completely lost in translation. But it doesn't sound like he plans on making the change any time soon.)
I really dislike how the teaching staff handled office hours. It felt like every other week, they were held at a different time and place. As a TA for a similarly large class, I know that it's hard to teach and study at the same time. But there is a minimum quality of service that we need to provide our students.

Workload: We have 7 homeworks. All of them included programming in MATLAB, and most had a written (math) component. They took me about 8 hours each. I liked that they allowed us to build things like a panorama app or computing depth from shading -- very gratifying when you finally get it working. It was frustrating not being allowed to use libraries for almost anything, including simple functions like converting an image from color to grayscale. I spent too much time reinventing the wheel and debugging problems related to MATLAB's flipped image coordinates or 1-based indexing, and not enough time working to solidify the algorithms we covered in class. 
The midterm exam was similar to the written parts of the homeworks, but more in depth. Kind of hard to study for. Expect to memorize a couple random formulas or you will not have a good time on the exam.

I have never done one of these Culpa reviews but I thought it was important to come on here and warn anyone considering this class. It has been my worst academic experience ever. I am an older student and I have struggled in classes before. I usually accept those struggles for what they are. But this was some other level stuff. His teaching approach is HORRIBLE. He does nothing to help non-engineering majors adjust to this class. I took it because I had an interest in digital information theory but this is just a flat out electrical engineering class. The class size fell by half and he had to cancel the homeworks and one quiz because everyone was struggling and complaining so much. This is not a bitter, mediocre student complaining. This is the reality of the situation. In quiz #2, the two long questions were worth the same 1 point as the 6 multiple choice questions.

Xavier is an engaging and fun lecturer and he uses this trait to hide huge laziness with regard to the syllabus and intensity of the class.

Given that this was Columbia, I wasn't super hopeful for much of the practical part, but I was hoping for at least some rigorous growth models and maybe one or two half-fluff case study esque things from which we could actually learn something useful about development.

The syllabus was never updated but rather, Professor Mann would send us email updated every week to tell us what to read. Those email updates came later and later throughout the semester until he emailed them on Monday morning when my recitation section was scheduled for Monday afternoon. I never knew what reading to do, I never knew what the lecture was going to be about. He never updated us about the first paper and gave us the topic very late and pushed the deadline. He updated us about the second paper the LITERAL LAST DAY OF CLASS when it was supposed to be due in early December. He pushed the deadline to December 19th and made the final due on December 22nd!! ON TOP OF THAT, he scheduled make-up classes for both Tuesday and Thursday during reading week and only when enough people complained about his ineptitude did he finally cancel the Thursday make up class.

I took Wang Laoshi for Third Year Chinese N and it was the worst decision of my life. She spends the whole time talking about the dialogue and stories in the textbook that she wrote, and then does not teach any of the grammar that constitutes a huge portion of the test. She assigns homework on grammar that she'll go over the next day after everyone says they are confused. Oh, and just FYI the Third Year Chinese N course that she teaches is not the same as any of the others but is ""Chinese for Humanities,"" which entails reading experts from classic Chinese stories and learning words like ""claw"" and ""concubine."" 
She's cold to students who ask questions, and is very impatient when people ask for clarification. She consistently will shame students who are struggling with the material in front of the class and will point out which students are doing better. She's very obvious about her preference for which students and will make reference to those students' lives (particularly if you studied with her in Columbia in Beijing). All in all, she does not care about her students, is impatient and puts students down for basic questions with the response ""you should already know that, why are you asking.""

This class was honestly the most interesting class that you could ever take. The content was so much fun and every lecture and seminar flew by. Professor Rashid is the BEST professor that I have ever had. He is genuinely the nicest man you will ever meet. He is definitely a feminist and is so personable. He plays music before class everyday (long live his rap tunes), and makes the funniest jokes during lecture. He's absolutely hysterical. Being in class felt like you were with a friend. I genuinely never wanted this class to end. He is the best lecturer Columbia has to offer. If possible, TAKE ANY CLASS WITH HIM. You will not regret it. Plus, it's insanley easy to get an A+ in this class. The assignments are super easy. It's a short paper of 250 works a week and you can write about whatever you want - just make sure you put in a lot of quotes from whatever you were assigned to read. Engaging with the text is something he likes to see, but do not summarize your readings. I was able to get a 3/3 or 4/3 on every paper and a 30/30 on the midterm paper. It's not hard. Plus, he offers a total of 10 points worth of extra credit during the semester. And as if that isn't easy enough, he takes your 10 highest weekly papers and drops the rest. By the time week 10 rolled around I already had a 3/3 or 4/3 on everything and I did not need to do anymore of the weekly papers, which was super nice because I was then able to focus on my other classes.

Professor Ainsworth's seminar is tough to get into, and for good reason. This seminar was probably the best class I've taken at Columbia, and Ainsworth is probably the best Professor I've had, and as a senior with one semester left I've had my fair share. 
Class is held at the Met (yes, really) once a week in the morning before the galleries open to the public. Ainsworth takes you through the European paintings galleries, focusing on Early Netherlandish works - her area of specialty. You'll get to learn about cutting edge developments in the technical examination of paintings, meaning that this isn't your ordinary art history class that limits your analysis to what you can see on the surface. Instead, she brings her expertise in the use of X-ray, IR, chemical studies, and more to the table. You'll be introduced to an entire world of underdrawings, retouching, and restoration that the typical museum visitor (or art history student) is seldom aware of. What you discover will be reinforced by the discussions you'll have when you visit specific departments in the Met that you'd never otherwise see - the conservation department in particular will blow your mind.
If you're interested in art appraisal, or if you've ever been guilty of nerding out over an episode of Antiques Roadshow, this class will teach you how to ask the right questions to get to heart of determining authenticity, attribution, condition, and quality. I can count on one hand the number of classes that have taught me a skill set I could go out and use immediately, and this is one of them. I thought I got a lot out of my museum visits after a taking few art history classes, but in hindsight I hadn't even scratched the surface. 
I can't recommend this class or professor highly enough. If you get into the seminar, take it. I don't care if you have to turn your schedule upside-down to do it. 
That said, this is an upper level seminar and the material is dense. You get out what you put in and Ainsworth isn't an easy grader. After all, she did write the book(s) when it comes to a lot of what you'll be learning. Make no mistake, the work will be fascinating, but a word to the wise:  it will feel much less like work and more like discovery if you truly love the art and research that you and those before you have dedicated to understanding it. 
As far as I'm aware this course is only offered in the Fall - so pay attention to the Spring application deadline, because it creeps up faster than you think! 
A final note - this is coming from an econ major with an art history concentration, so don't be discouraged from applying if you aren't majoring in art history. You need to have a firm grasp of the concepts to be successful, but this is not dependent on your major or prior course-load. 
Workload:
One assignment halfway through the semester asked us to review an exhibition she had curated at another museum in the city.
The main assignment is a final paper and class presentation that, if done correctly, should be quite time consuming. Best not to put this off, especially since the research process of reading the Met's curatorial files is incredibly interesting - honestly, you'll learn the most if take your time and really dig for information. 
Participation in class (heavily dependent on your ability to keep up with the readings) surely factors in as well. 
If you ever need help or have questions, Ainsworth is remarkably reachable even though her duties at the Met are numerous. She often made time for students after class, which was especially helpful with regard to the paper. She is a great resource for all things Met- and art history-related, so don't be shy.

AVOID. An incredible lecturer?! Is the person below me insane?! This professor is awful, he doesn't actually lecture about course material and you WILL end up teaching yourself this course and putting in hours of studying for a mediocre grade. Hence, taking this pass/fail. The exams were impossible (75 questions in just over an hour) and he actively tries to trick you and make the questions impossible to understand with unnecessary jargon (just so you know, the class average on each exam was between a 62 and 65, and the class high was consistently in the 70s, so let that sink in). Don't be fooled by his apparent charm on the first day, it translates to nothing but irrelevant lectures with tangents that make no sense. Take this class only if you enjoy seeing your GPA die a slow death and listening to a 70-something man stand at the front of the class and talk in ridiculous jargon for an hour and 15 minutes while you profoundly question why you ignored this culpa review. And if on the second day of lecture, you are frantically flipping through your textbook trying to locate where his lectures are pertaining to, know that you are just one of many generations of Perceptioners before you that had no idea what was going on.

Okay I took this class in spite of the bad reviews and truthfully Maura Spiegel is now my favorite teacher this year and someone I would honestly like to be friends with. The discussions we had in class were some of the most thought provoking and interesting and comfortable discussions I've had all year. 
She also brought snacks every class and treated all of us so kindly. I'm not sure how approachable she is in her larger classes (we only had seven kids in our class) but she was very friendly and easy to talk to.
She's not the most organized but I loved that about her. Not every teacher should teach the same rigid, unpredictable way. But if you can't handle that teaching style, maybe think twice about it.

Not a good class, but what are you going to do?  Mandatory for the Econ major.
The class through to the midterm were taught by Professor Miikka Rokkanen, who I believe is only a year or so into his time at Columbia.  He was very adept at distilling the important pieces from the textbook readings and provided a manageable amount of slides (""Just the facts, ma'am"").  Most importantly, his self-effacing presence and genuine enthusiasm shone through.  Show me someone who loves what they're doing, and I'll be his audience.
But this review is to be about Professor Seyhan (Erden).
My sense is that Professor Seyhan has grown tired with teaching the course at a count now in/near the double digits.  That's no slight against her character.  It's normal for people at work to get stuck with tedium.  If you had a PhD and were working at one of the most famous research universities in the world, would you really want to be teaching introductory material year after year to bunch of kids?  Smart people don't like routine.  I keep an open mind that her performance and overt interest is there, but for her graduate courses where she has a chance to pursue the hard and interesting parts of her work.
Having checked through the previews on Coursehero it would seem that the problem sets haven't been updated very much or at all.  What's confounding is how riddled with mistakes both the problems and the solutions are.  Part I is compromised of a handful of TRUE/FALSE/UNCERTAIN statements, for which one is to provide justification for the selection.  Given the EXTREMELY poor writing, it's hard not choose uncertain as the answer for the majority of the questions.  Regrettably, it rarely is.  As such, one is compelled to visit Seyhan's office hours or those of the TA's.  For Seyhan, the answers and advice don't always come automatically.  It's almost as if she is herself trying to recall what she had written and what she meant.   Should you seek the advice of the TA's, you'll find yourself emeshed with them as you both try to discern what exactly is being asked.  You'd figure that for the time spent getting clarification on the questions, it would inspire a heavy revision.  I'd say this is as much the fault of the Professor as the TA's.  Speak up!  Don't shy away just because your boss has that PhD that you covet.  This seems to be a pervasive sloppiness.  That right there is a chief reason that to think the Professor has lost her enthusiasm for the course.
The piazza discussion board is rife with questions seeking little else but clarification of the questions.  It's common on the problem sets that you'll be given a laconic instruction to perform something in STATA, except that the commands needed weren't covered in class or weren't explained in any depth ... and they certainly aren't documented well for your reference.  You'll be acting more like a monkey plugging in text than a focused student actually understanding what's going on under the hood.  The proper response to this problem is to have instructions, separate from the slides, drafted up with the commands and some expansive commentary to elucidate what they are doing and to match them up to the long form equations covered in the text.  That's just good pedagogy.
Returning to the lectures, it's worth noting that the the slides aren't posted to coursework until after the Professor has completed her presentation of the topic in lecture.  Her contention for this policy is that it incentivizes the students to attend lecture (perhaps a performance metric for her).  That's just ass backwards.  Instead, those attending are left worse off as they struggle to write up notes and copy equations into their notebooks--you robbed of the time to actually listen and absorb her commentary.  The correct way to run any presentation anywhere is to provide materials beforehand so they can be reviewed, and more usefully marked up with personal notes during the meeting.  Consider this one of those disconnects between academia and the real world.
The textbook in play, Introduction to Econometrics by Stock & Watson, is fairly good.  There are moments when the authors make big leaps in the manipulations of the questions.  I struggle trying to figure out what the hell is going on.  More arrogance than empathy, but that's typical academic fair, especially in mathematics where the author's predilection for abstract thought often subsumes an ability to write well.
Because this is a mandatory course for the Econ sequence, you must take it.  Given what I've seen, I'd be inclined to try another professor if I could do it again.  Multiple sections of the course occur in any given semester, and for mine, they were all shared by Rokkanen and Erden.  If you need some quality time, I'd suggest you pop into the lecture with the lowest number of attendees.  Despite what you might be lead to believe by one of the ongoing examples in the test book, class size does matter ... a lot.
Workload:
9 Problem sets, which can take many hours (if you don't acquire the solution sets from internet or otherwise, which I've heard many a student does).
Midterm - meh.  Also peculiar that the through the first four or five problems sets the class average was in the low- to mid-90s, and yet the midterm average was about a 70.  The content was was also a lot easier than the problem sets, except too long to properly work them through and proof them.  Success in life is rarely about speed.  Accuracy and clarity are often the important things, something that doesn't come through in the course very much.
Final - TBD.

Took his class last year and still remember the way he suggested he'd read all the CULPA reviews, bad ones of course. So I am here to do him some justice. To be clear, I've taken 2 psych lectures and 2 labs and hated ALL of them, not because I wasn't interested in psych but because they were unnecessarily time-consuming.  That being said, Prof. Light really taught me a lot and prepared me well for the more ""advanced"" psych lab.

Professor Carnes is one of the best professors I've had. At the beginning of the year, I was not looking forward to taking a large history lecture, but Carnes really knows how to engage the students. His class does require effort and it's best to create study groups to go over the material, but his teaching style is so captivating that if you pay attention, you'll just have to review for the midterm and final. However, his exams can be a bit tricky if you don't really understand the main concepts and spend time memorizing dates because he puts quotes on the exams, which you have to identify who said the quotes and the significance of them. He is a lenient grader and does his best to learn students' names even if it's a lecture of over 50 people. Highly recommend to take Professor Carnes!

Professor Archibong is a good professor and knows the material well. She does her best to convey the material in a simple way, but sometimes it gets convoluted so if you space out for a few minutes, you'll most likely be lost in the lecture. She assigns A LOT of reading, but also states that at the beginning of the semester so that shouldn't come as a surprise. The TA grades most of the material for the class, and is always returned late. The class was told the essays would be returned at the end of one week, but didn't get them back until 2 and a half weeks later. The TA is not the best TA and has specific requirements of what she is looking for in your essays. Copies and pastes feedback between students' essays and is a really harsh grader; if you don't cover some point the TA is looking for, don't expect a B+ on the paper even if it may be the best paper you've written. The TA can sometimes be really rude in recitation, so if that's someone you want to avoid, then avoid this course. If the course had a different TA, then it may have been more enjoyable with Professor Archibong.

I found Qingmin's Game Theory class to be very enjoyable. He clearly loves the material, and actually seems to enjoy teaching it too. I would agree that his lectures are powerpoint driven, but these are heavily supplemented by his oration which will often include interesting examples and anecdotes. 
Although he is quite blunt, he is also very approachable. At the end of each of his monologues he will end with ""Questions?"". He is then really quite patient in answering them before moving on. 
Communication between him and the TAs is a bit of a joke, but the two we had have been really helpful and great teachers. We only ended up with 3 psets, 1 of which was dropped. Their recitations and solutions were very helpful in understanding these though. 
The difficulty with having so few psets is that the midterms consisted of questions we had never done questions on (although which may have come up in class). Couple with the lack of practice questions, it is a little hard to know what is coming.
Grading remains the same as in one of the reviews below.

Homa is extremely good at expressing content clearly and concisely. She states the important points in a few different ways such that the material becomes ingrained. She is also just very agreeable, funny, and down to Earth.  
The course was structured such that the important information was streamlined and the less relevant/more convoluted material was left for a later course. Someone who already has some background in econometrics therefore might find it pretty easy, while anyone who is trying the subject for the first time ends up with a very firm understanding of the most important concepts/methods. If you are especially looking to learn R, this course won't provide you with any incentive structure but might present an opportunity for you to do so according to your own motivation. 
The replication of an actual study that utilized econometrics was pretty tricky for most people (our data set was partially in Dutch, for example) but Prof. Zarghamee was very understanding if a team had put in a significant amount of effort but ran into trouble. She is generally extremely helpful. It is important to note that this is the first time that the class was taught with R instead of Stata, which would inevitably have an impact on the difficulty/plausibility of the assignment.
All in all, she made it was far more interesting than I expected it to be. It obviously dug into some more technical aspects of the major. I only wish I had tried econometrics sooner.

Put simply: 
Take it with Archibong if it's a course requirement, actually take notes in class (it will matter for the final), focus on theoretical expectations of how the policy/issue might play out-not reality- for the essays, and this could actually provide a pretty good historical framework for the econ major. 
Details: 
She very effectively compiles a significant amount of material into manageable sections. At the cost of being somewhat redundant, she touches on the important points more than once as to ingrain them. She is down to Earth and difficult not to like, making engaging mentions of her research and background. Her human rights-centric perspective drew me to the joint major. 
More focus on what we should draw on/consider as ""economic analysis"" during class would make the grading of the first essay much more fair. At this point it felt like taking a shot in the dark. 
It was actually a pretty comprehensive overview of much of the political economic thought that much of the major is based upon. I would recommend Prof. Archibong over the other professors who teach this material based upon what I've heard of them.  Her lectures were well focused on the fundamental concepts/perspectives of economic philosophy and summarized them well. The lecture slides thoroughly identified all the necessary concepts, but students have to actually pay attention to be able to fill them in sufficiently. 
The expectations for the essays were unclear and frustrating for many students. Although ""economic analysis"" is clearly listed as being heavily weighted on the rubric, the prompt and rubric are vague about the meaning of this. It is unclear that it is in fact asking for a depiction of how demand and supply curves might theoretically move when an event occurs, as opposed to the more literal and concrete interpenetration of how a policy might play out (which multiple students apparently provided and were downgraded for).

A considerable amount of time was spent giving brief overviews of how things work in the fields of Human Rights and Public Health, but this was confined to the first few classes. The remainder of the course was deep diving into essential topics such as reproductive health, torture, advocacy etc. This structure was fantastic for anyone who has never taken a human rights course but wants to skip to the fun part (as opposed to starting with intro courses). Also, both professors seemed to place high value on providing feedback, when it was requested.
That being said, the assignment prompts were vague and there was little guidance regarding the expectations for our structure/focus/writing. This was frustrating for the midterm, which felt like taking a shot in the dark and for some, being unsuccessful.

I disagree on nearly every point with the previous reviewer. Tamar is an excellent and dedicated instructor and simply expects the same from her students, if you are not passionate about the material, do not take the course. If you ask her questions about the material without having first read it, you will obviously be frustrated when you subsequently do not understand her explanations either, there are no tricks here, it will be the most logical course you have ever taken. On the other hand, abstract ideas are not going to simply be handed to you in digestible form, effort is necessary. I had the privilege of stumbling into the course and now have an immensely powerful analytic tool that I will have for the rest of my life.

Lynch was so poorly qualified to teach Lit Hum, I would have been better off in the library reading the books every day for two hours--which is pretty much what every one did in class anyway. Class was a silent room filled with the droning monotone of Lynch's thoughts on the general themes of the curriculum-- the treatment of women in Greek society, the role of the gods in mythology. He did not solicit class involvement and when students did interact, he did not encourage the conversation to move along. We opened our books probably once every two weeks; there was almost no close reading done in class. Lynch seemed to consider it more of a history course than a literature course. 
The most interesting class was the day after the Nov election, when we asked Lynch, who is a federal judge (and Columbia law school prof) what he thought. This turned into a discussion on this involvement in the Lil Kim case...clearly had nothing to do with Lit Hum. On the other hand, the saddest day of class was when Lynch ran out of topics to (pretend to) talk about and silence pervaded the class for more than a minute. So Lynch let out class early that day, because he couldn't find anything else to talk about. And this is a class with dense epic texts...(can you ever run out of things to talk about? if you actually analyzed them?)

Xavi was easily one of the best professors I have had at Columbia. I can't recommend him highly enough. My Spanish improved quite a bit this semester, and Xavi was so funny, charming, and enthusiastic that attending class was always a joy. He was a great lecturer who explained new grammar concepts patiently and clearly; he spoke slowly enough that it was easy to understand what he was saying, which meant that he hardly ever had to explain anything in English; he gave every student detailed, constructive, timely feedback throughout the semester; and maybe most importantly, he made it clear that he cared deeply about all of his students and wanted us not only to succeed but also to take care of our mental and physical wellbeing (a rarity for a Columbia professor). I will genuinely miss being in his class next semester. If you get a chance to take Spanish with him, do not hesitate.

Professor Lee is the most hands-off (by which I mean uncaring, withdrawn, and lazy) professor I've encountered at Columbia. She would give students written critiques that were barely a paragraph long and littered with typos; she hardly ever spoke up in class; and she seemed determined *not* to get to know any of her students or create a warm atmosphere for the workshop. While I ended up enjoying this course thanks to my wonderful classmates, who put in a lot of work and really ran the workshops each week, I was truly taken aback by how little effort Professor Lee seemed to put into the class; at times, it was almost insulting, given how much effort the rest of us were putting in. Moral of the story: if you have good people in your class, Professor Lee won't ruin it, but she won't contribute much either. I'd recommend taking the workshop with someone else if you can.

Overall, Connie's class was a blast. I saw some people falling asleep here and there, but everyone loved him. You really need to love to read translated old Chinese philosophical texts and need to remember a bunch of Chinese and Japanese people's names which may be a bit difficult for some people. You would sometimes need to speak louder so he can actually hear you, unless your TA is super nice and repeats what you said to him. Even though his lectures go really off-topic sometimes and not consistent, he is everybody's favorite grandpa!

Adrian is a passionate instructor that expects you to engage with the material. If you don't know a lot about Spanish and Latin American history he won't hesitate to explain things to you.
This is one of the best classes I've taken at Columbia. There should be an option to take this instead of CC. The readings were all relevant, except the religious texts at the beginning which were really difficult to read. However, Adrian explained everything and was always open to provide background information and handouts in english to help us understand! 
Although this class is known to be challenging, it was worth it because Adrian made it interesting, so at times it didn't even feel that hard. It was cool that sometimes Adrian would adapt the discussion based what we were actually interested in talking about.
Even though Adrian can be very sarcastic, which might make you feel judged for being completely lost because his accent can be difficult to understand, he's actually a funny and encouraging professor that is willing to help you do well in the class. This class is more ""about learning"" than anything else so he doesn't like mundane summaries and does not judge you if you make Spanish mistakes as long as you bring up something interesting. 
Although he is not an easy professor, and sometimes the workload might seem impossible, he makes his students, including non-native speakers, feel comfortable and welcome to contribute to the class discussion. 
He even brings food and snacks to class!

His Lectures are well organized, relatable, he stays on topic, throws a few jokes to keep you awake, but he can be intimidating.  
My advice to overcome the wall between you and Jae is to go to the Hackathon and introduce yourself.  He's actually nice if you get his attention.  It seems like he prefers a student that doesn't need their hand held (which is the intimidating part) but pestering him is a good way to show him you care/will work hard.  I think that could be why some students don't like him as a person.  If it's really that bad, then hire a tutor (I did).  Your tutor is pretty much your employee at that point.  If you can't hire a tutor (a good CS tutor is $$$$$), then you need to make sure this is the only difficult class you are taking because you will live in the TA room.  If you can't either see Jae, hire a tutor, or be in the TA room for almost every OH, then you are probably cheating in order to do well.
My advice for the cheaters is that you will get caught so proceed with caution.  You could lie (most cheaters are also liars), but you'll get caught!  I can't stress this enough.  Jae says this in the beginning too and people still think they can do it. 
My advice for if you don't cheat (i didn't but I almost regretted not doing it), just let it go.  I think Jae pretty much hit the nail on the head when he said those people who cheat like that won't make it very far in the world of CS.  Just worry about yourself and try your best to have fun.  There was an intrinsic reward in the end.  I did become a better programmer after this and real world programming made just a little more sense.  
Go to every lecture and don't bother opening your laptop.  The notes are posted to the server so stop pretending you're taking notes and just watch what he does.  Read over the notes later.
Use the drops and extensions strategically.  You will need them, but try not to drop any of the ones right around the midterm.  I think around lab5-8/9 (can't fully remember) is when you really should focus.
The exams are tricky.  If you don't like your grade just argue a lot.  I will say that if you KNOW how to do the homework, then you KNOW what he's asking in the exam.  You'll be able to argue for your points (all points matter) if you KNOW.  Also, his exams are pretty much from the lectures and old exams.

 Comparatively speaking, this course has been a superior experience in terms of imparting knowledge and tools in introductory statistics from any predecessor that I have taken. Professor Cunningham possesses an unmatched passion for his field that is as refreshingly tangible as it is infectious. The curriculum is crafted in a structured, organized, and accessible manner and Cunningham’s lectures are delightfully animated by his witty antics and desire to thoroughly communicate the topics at hand. 
Through adjustments implemented during the semester, Cunningham has demonstrated that he is both receptive and encouraging when it comes to feedback from his students.
There was, however, an illusion at certain points in the semester, (that existed predominantly in the first half) that I was taking two courses instead of one due to the large disparity between what we were being taught in lecture and what the readings and assignments were on.
By its nature, this class is oftentimes heavily bogged down with mathematical proofs and intricate notation. Cunningham was mostly able to navigate this well, though he tends to sacrifice simplicity by heavily embellishing points that could otherwise be delivered far more optimally. If he were to thoroughly follow through on some of the exercises he had inventively illustrated in his lecture slides, I feel students would be better able to intuit concepts.
Cunningham broadens the scope of the topics he teaches to be applicable and useful outside of the classroom which is an invaluable and highly recommendable quality.

I am sorry to say so but Prof. Lo is not really approachable. If you sent him emails, it would be a miracle that he replied.
He never designed or graded the mid-terms himself, separating himself with his students, only to be told the mid-terms were not even related to what he expected us to know.
I really see no point of spending more than 200 dollars per class listening to him reading the textbook, let alone the fact that he could not even read his own notes clearly.
Maybe the only good thing about Prof. Lo's class is that he did do something after the exam to make you feel better, yet I am not sure whether he has well thought through his ideas before presenting it to the class.
In sum, it may be a good idea to save some money and time, and learn this course by yourself. However, the Department of Statistics has made this one a compulsory course for anyone whose major has something to do with statistics; and Prof. Lo happened to be the only one who is teaching this course.
So be prepared. Don't have too much expectation from this course. Or maybe, it is going to overturn your perception of what a Columbia education is like.
If given a chance, I wish I had never taken this course.
Best luck!

Professor Marten was one of the hardest working professors. You can just tell that she loves teaching and she is genuinely passionate. I think it also helps that she has other stuff going on in her professional life beyond teaching polisci so her life is dynamic which also makes her lectures dynamic. She definitely is engaging and makes you question on how you used to perceive global politics. In short, she's great lecturer.
But did I like her teaching style? Perhaps, but not entirely. First of all, you can clearly tell that she's biased. And for me, that was neither a bad or a good thing, but some people don't like it when professors are biased - so that's for you peeps. 
Second of all, she goes through the frigging powerpoints so quickly. You look down and write some stuff, look up and she's talking about a completely new topic. And the way she writes all her notes up on the slides psychologically encourages people to write down her notes word by word when that clearly was not the case; hence many people end up just rewriting notes and not listening. At least I fell into that trap in the beginning. And she goes over rather complex ideas so quickly that you might lose track of what is being discussed at times, but if you do her readings ,you should be fine. But overall, her teaching style was just too quick for anyone to really copy down her notes - I would encourage instead listening more carefully and writing scarcely (although she doesnt post her powerpoint...) 
Her midterms and finals were definitely tough. Not the easiest bunch, although if you tried, you could get an A- at least. 
But don't treat this as an easy ""A"" just because it's an ""introduction"" class. Also the grading can get subjective because different TAs grade differently - just gotta pray!

He is just a fantastic lecturer and honestly a very calm yet passionate man who has extensive knowledge and experience of the Middle East. Sure, his views can be slightly biased but you have to understand where he is coming from... just read his wiki page and you'll see what I'm saying. Also, as someone who is highly influential in historical discourse, he definitely takes time to listen to your questions and respond to them thoughtfully. His lectures, although at 8:40am, are great. Very engaging if you really wanna know about this part of the region that has been misinterpreted significantly.

Solid and enjoyable class. The course essentially surveys different areas of database systems (e.g. information retrieval, OLAP systems, data mining etc), beyond the relational paradigm that is covered in 4111. We typically spent 1-2 lectures on each topic. While that meant we weren't necessarily able to go into too much depth, Prof Gravano does a great job explaining everything and I personally felt like I got a lot out of the class. 
Professor Gravano is really nice, in addition to being a great lecturer. The readings were helpful, but his lectures are really clear and I found them to be most helpful for learning the material. He was very responsive on Piazza too which is always helpful. He seems to care about his students, and did a good job answering questions in class.

I took Jewish Medieval Literature because I needed a Global Core. It actually ended up being my favorite class of the semester. Professor Levy is a really great teacher. What's great about this class is that it's really specific. If you're someone like me who gets frustrated by seminars about really broad topics where all you hear is students talking about how the readings made them feel -- this class is the opposite. Dr. Levy is incredibly knowledgable and has even translated some of the texts on the syllabus. She brings out the best in students.

The worst class I've ever taken at Columbia! First of all, the homework material does not reflect what we cover in class (when we asked him if we have to know the material that was covered in the homework, Cunningham had no idea what the hell we were talking about because he is not the one assigning the homeworks--the TAs do that). Secondly, he mostly covers proofs and concepts in class rather than solving problems. Although I am perfectly okay with that, as a consequence of his homework not being reflective of the material we must know for the class, we get absolutely no practice for preparing for the exams (Oh btw, his exams are probably one of the most hardest exams I have ever taken at Columbia so far).
It's a sign that there's something wrong with the professor when he covers concepts like Poisson distributions, ANOVA, logistic regression that even people taking higher level statistics classes right now had not yet learned or had just covered them in their 4000 level classes. If you want to keep your sanity, avoid Cunningham. His class is five times harder than intermediate level CS and Econ. classes I'm taking right now, COMBINED.

Well, it's Fall 2016 and not a thing has changed with Professor Messick and his droning lectures and his fascination with himself. His never read a paper, never give a straight answer modus operandi is still in effect and I think it will never go away.  He simply cannot be bothered to give a coherent answer to a simple question.  My ""what would you like us to focus on in evaluating the readings"" (2 pages every week, read and graded by the TA) was met with a blank look and an ""Oh, just give me your take on it."" before he moved away from me (clearly ending the not yet started conversation) to fiddle with the podium he likes to stand next to.
The man continues to be super impressed with himself and most of the assigned readings are either from his oeuvre, such as it is, from someone he knows (and likes, he never once mentioned another anthropologist without acting as if they were besties) or from someone who cites him.  He remains entranced with Yemen and regularly speaks of his time there, even showing slides of pics he took while there - in the 80s! By mid-semester, myself and at least two classmates were entirely disgusted with the class.  Frankly, if this course wasn't satisfying a global core requirement, I'd of dropped the course and taken the W. 
He did read our mid-term papers, but he provided such scant feedback you don't know if you were on track or not. He didn't touch our weekly papers ad I haven't the faintest clue who is reading our finals - this review is being the typed prior to finals being over, nor have grades been submitted.  I don't even care what grade I got, I'm just sooooo very happy to be done with him, and I will make damn sure that I never take another class from him.  If you are wise, you will make sure you never take the first class from him.

Overall this was a very fulfilling class and it's brought new perspectives into my life. Professor Stark is a very animated and interesting person. Class meets twice a week but Professor Stark tried to only lecture through one of them, with the second one focusing on discussion. He really tries to engage everyone and make the class a collaborative learning effort, rather than him just talking at you, granted he does go on tangents at times. Material is very applicable to a variety of interests--psych, economics, sociology, business and you get a mix of new faces in the class, which is nice. There's a good amount of reading, but it's only per week rather than class and it's all interesting/relevant. Professor Stark and the TAs also really encourage you to explore something that interests you for your final paper, which allows you to get really creative. The class is not particularly hard but worth investing your time in if you do choose to take it.

Definitely not the easiest way to fulfill your science requirement for the Core, but I'd guess probably one of the most fulfilling/meaningful options available, especially if you're someone who has little to no experience programming (as was the case for me). His lectures are coherent and well-planned, the TA's are helpful and accommodating, and his lateness policy is really generous (he gives you 170 grace hours for the whole semester, which you can use to submit assignments after the due date without any penalty).

Like all previous reviewers have said, Carman's an excellent lecturer who makes his points very clear and takes time to clarify and explain difficult concepts. He also has a great sense of humor and endless knowledge of both philosophy and subjects that might not seem to be closely related to philosophy at first glance, like neuroscience and classical music. His classes are a joy to be in, and you manage to get a lot out of them, though I can see that people with a bit of knowledge in philosophy already might find the style of his lectures a bit boring, as he tends to reiterate points quite a bit to make sure we really understand the concepts. Carman also takes time to answer more or less any question students might have, sometimes to good effect and clarifying valid confusions, and sometimes to just entertain the inquirer while trying to steer the subject back to the lecture at hand. This makes his lectures seem a little disorganized at times, though I think he always gets time to say everything he wants to say.
As previous reviewers have also said, Carman isn't an easy grader. It's not impossible to get an A or A- in his class (I got an A- on both the papers I turned in), but he really makes you work for it, and if my peek at his gradebook was accurate, he's given out a few Cs and C-s to particularly bad papers, with the majority of grades being Bs. However, Carman more than makes up for his difficult grading with extensive and fair feedback on your writing. I never felt that I deserved better than I got in his class, though some might find Carman to have overly high standards.

Kaye's a great professor all-around who's both passionate about the material he teaches and educating undergrads about it. His lectures are highly organized, and one might think that listening to an old professor read out of his notes about the Middle Ages would be boring, but his style and voice (which is very pleasant to listen to) make all of the material he covers seem extremely captivating. Some might find the thematic approach a bit confusing, but I appreciated it, and felt like all the material tied together in cohesive fashion by the end of the class, and really allowed you to appreciate the period and the vitality of medieval culture (and yes, Kaye does a great job of dispelling traditional stereotypes of the Middle Ages). Even if you're not interested in medieval history I'd advise taking the class- I'm sure you'll get a lot out of it if you don't go in expecting to learn about what people typically regard as medieval.
Kaye's also an incredibly enthusiastic and open professor who takes time to speak to undergrads and develop their interests in history outside class- particularly if you visit him during office hours, when he's more than happy to just spend an hour talking with you about medieval history in general even if you don't have any questions. He gave me a bunch of his old journals to read through once when I asked him and was more than happy to talk with me about the articles in them. 
In terms of grading, Kaye is very fair. If you write good papers and give good answers on the exams you'll get an A. He doesn't grade to be harsh, but a certain level of accuracy and detail is expected in terms of your exam answers. He expects you to read primary sources closely and with attention to detail and an analytical mindset. The discussion sections are really helpful in that regard and even entertaining (Adam, our TA, has a great and very sarcastic sense of humor).

I didn't see any reviews for Schaub in terms of his Lit Hum class, so I thought I would try to help people out with this. Schaub is a very good Lit Hum instructor- he makes the class mostly discussion-focused, but stopped us occasionally to make his own comments or to shoot down a point if it got too ridiculous. The class was run without quizzing, study guides, or any of the other painful extra work that some other Lit Hum sections integrate: it's all discussion, some of which is lively and interesting, and some of which is just tossed in for the participation grade. 
In terms of papers and exams, Schaub is a fairly generous grader. He informed us that he didn't give any grades below a B on our first paper, at the very least, and that he defined an A as a ""very good"" paper- I got an A on both my papers despite turning in a lightly revised first draft for my second one. He provides great feedback on all exams and papers we got back, which is insightful without being harsh. 
If I had one complaint to make, it's that I didn't find any of the class especially mind-blowing. I thought Schaub's comments on the texts were interesting and insightful, but there wasn't anything to make me reconsider how I read literature or existence itself or anything- it was just an enjoyable class with an instructor who had good things to say. If there was a model for a standard and well-executed Lit Hum section, I think this would be it- no deviations from the syllabus whatsoever, good (but not great) discussion, and a well-organized and fair instructor who was available for help and very responsive to requests for it. More or less, I'm trying to say that you should consider yourself quite lucky if you've ended up in Schaub's section, but I'd tell you not to expect the Core section that Columbia sells in its admissions process (though I really have my doubts as to whether or not that ideal section- 22 students with insightful things to say and a brilliant professor to guide them- actually exists or not).

Just wanted to throw this out to help out my future columbia lions that are thinking about taking this class. I repeat this is the easiest and most interesting class I have every taken at Columbia....... PAUSE NOTTTTTTT..... This class absolutely sucks. Kathleen may be the most cold hearted, un-funny, and pretentious teacher (I don't even want to call her a professor because it would be a shame to all of the other professors in the world) I have ever met in my life. The lectures could not be more boring.... absolutely brutal. This class was at 7:10pm and I tell you what, I think I learn more useful information watching grass grow or paint dry than I do in this class. The lecture are basically her reading of a powerpoint and the learning aspect is pretty much you just learning vocab words along with memorizing different regions of the brain. Midterms are useless, she overloads information to where it half way drives you crazy. She has way too many strict guidelines and does not accommodate to any student needs.

If you're a premed and a bio major, do yourself a favor and do not take this class. I'll break it down for you. 
1. This is more of a public health class than a self-respecting biology class. The first class dealt with...history...That would be fine, if it was to build context to the diseases in context, which in fairness, it did. However, SHE TESTS YOU ON THE HISTORY. Where is the biology in that? It gets to my second point, which is 
2. You have ~50 slides each class to go over each class, which is fine. However, there is ZERO direction or indication of what she wants you to learn. Should I memorize the mechanism of how Tamiflu fights influenza? Or should I memorize how many cases of Ebola occurred in 2015, not 2014? Maybe I should memorize this graph VERBATIM of the timeline of drug approval (no joke, she just pulled a random slide and told us to fill in the blanks). At the end of the day, you absolutely waste your valuable time learning hard-to-pronounce drug names and what country has the highest incidence rate of cholera, but get tested on who discovered Salvarsan.
3.  The syllabus is incredibly ambitious with its scope. I wish she had just focused on a subset of diseases and clearly delineated drugs that combat them. Instead, we talked about too many subsets of viral and bacterial diseases that it was impossible to really understand fundamental mechanisms about these diseases. For example, a student who has taken virology could snooze through her lectures on viral diseases because Racaniello, in my opinion, taught the subject very well. Lili, however, could not in the time that she had.  
4. The final presentations. In theory, it represents a time when people can present on topics they find interesting and hopefully have the class understand different diseases/medications a bit better. In practice, it falls far short. You are given 5.5 minutes to talk about a drug, a disease, or a chapter in a book (which is really just an oral book report). In that time, you can't be engaging or interesting; it's all about spewing out as much information as possible about the complex mechanisms of breast cancer or rheumatoid arthritis. It's not possible to be coherent and frankly loses the audience. If a person uses up all of the 5.5 minutes, the Professor wouldn't even have time for the audience to ask questions and instead quizzes the presenter on the topic. What seriously bugged me though was that some of the questions were obviously spontaneously thought-up and hardly relevant to the presentation. 
I'm actually rather upset that this was my last biology major class I have taken during my time here. The department is full of wonderful professors with engaging material and a drive to teach. Yes, Lili is nice and seems to be genuinely passionate about what she teaches, but it's the execution. What have I learned from the class? Maybe what I've learned from an objective standpoint was useful, like the importance of a macro understanding of disease trends. However, I fail to see why I needed to MEMORIZE statistics and every detail on each slide, just to make sure I wouldn't be caught off-guard during a test. 
If you're a bio major and enjoyed LEARNING (not necessarily the grading =p) biology from professors like Racaniello or even Mowsh, then stay away from this class. You're gonna be so disappointed.

Awful awful awful awful. First I thought the course would be interesting. Only midway did he decide to make us suffer and talk of topics that are in no way instructive on Congress, especially for people taking this as an intro to congress level (meaning talking about spatial theories of voting, and committee theories and so on). I am not American and wanted to learn about Congress, yet all I came to realize is that this class was just horrible and I truly learnt NOTHING.
Lecture: boring dry hard to follow not so much american politics, probably more of a mix between american politics and research methods/math methods for poli sci
Workload:
The amount of readings he assigns are preposterous. Around 13-15 chapters from 4 DIFFERENT books every two weeks. All books talk of the same thing so he clearly just wanted us to suffer even more and just assign four books on the same topics.
Exams:
Nit-picky IDs from readings. Truly NO ONE in the class answered a few that showed up on the exam because it was neither spoken of in class, or in the books (which I have on Kindle so I did a control+f, and nothing came up). So again, just a really ridiculous move on his hand.
Grading: meh, ok not too strict, but then again you have to make sure to answer every part of every question and god forbid you forget to mention a tiny little bit you'll pose 1/2 the points.
Overall: save yourself and your time and please do not take this class. I promise you will not learn ANYTHING about congress and just realize that you made a huge mistake

Do not take this class. Taylor is a terrible lecturer, her test are ridiculously hard and requires a lot of useless memorization, and she is very unaccommodating to any requests. Her lectures are just reading off of old reused power points, and are extremely boring, especially being at night class. Although you can drop the lowest test, they are all unfairly graded because she makes the rubric overly specific so that partial points are hard to come by. She requires you to remember hundreds of terms that serve no purpose other than to just to make your life more difficult. She is very unapproachable and makes any special requests seem like the end of the world. She tries to make jokes in class that aren't funny.

DON'T LISTEN TO THE NAYSAYERS!
This was the most interesting class I have taken thus far at Columbia, and Lax is one of the best professors I have ever had. Some reviews say he is too fast paced, but in class he would ALWAYS take the time to answer any questions and re-explain difficult concepts (with multiple examples).
Whenever I emailed him, Lax always responded to my questions within an hour or two (even late at night). I never took advantage of office hours, but he seemed very accommodating in scheduling appointments with students. He is clearly very knowledgable and he is good at explaining unfamiliar theorems/concepts. Sometimes Lax goes a little off topic telling stories, but they're funny and it doesn't really impede the class.
Overall, the workload is pretty light. But if you take this course, YOU MUST GO TO CLASS. As other reviews have said, there is no textbook and the information is NOT online. Take lots of notes!!!

He is very sweet and funny, and the class is very enjoyable because it is so small and the readings are so engaging.

Caterina is literally the nicest person on the planet. I read all the other reviews about how amazing she is and how wonderful her class is but somehow I didn't believe them, and went in thinking that this class would be really challenging. It's not. It's a suuuper easy global core, all you have to do is memorize the terms she puts on the board in lecture and be able to recognize some documents and images on the midterm/finals. There are usually two papers, but she took one off this semester (and anyway they're both very short, like 5 pages). Caterina will do anything in her power to raise your grade and make your experience in her class positive. She cares so much about what she's teaching, but she's also extremely reasonable with her requirements and expectations. She understands that people have lives outside her class, and she really takes that into account with the workload. You never have to read the textbook, just go to class. But DO go to class, because literally everything she wants in the exams is in her lectures, so you'll never have to do any outside work if you just go to lecture (you won't even have to study much if you memorize the terms as you go along). She makes an effort to get to know everyone's names (especially if you come to class regularly) and if you participate a little in lecture it makes her day and will definitely boost your grade (usually she discusses a primary source doc for 10 minutes with the class). Also, she's brilliant and her lectures are always fascinating and she gives a great overview of a really crucial historical period. Sometimes she talks a little fast, but you don't really need details, just the broad themes from every lecture, so don't stress about that. Also definitely go to her office hours for any reason, even just to say hi. Basically, if you want a thematic, not-date specific, light workload global core, this is the way to go. And Caterina will make it absolutely a pleasure to attend class and be engaged in the subject. 
Workload:
Super light. The reading for class is primary source documents, usually 1-10 pages (mostly 1 or 2 pages, but some weeks 10). Discussion readings for section are not tested on the exams, so you can skim them or skip them completely depending on if your TA makes you write discussion questions or not. (Technically there's a textbook assignment every week but literally no one does it and it's not necessary at all -- IF you go to lecture.)

I'm writing this because I think people deserve fair warning about what they're getting into with this class, since it sounds fun and easy and entertaining, but is not as straightforward as all that. The class IS fun and has a light workload (and a lot of the time he just shows videos in class), but it is NOT an easy A, on the contrary -- it's incredibly hard to do well, and most people seemed really shocked by the grades they were getting. The class is an overview of different sports in America and the way they relate to politics and race, class and gender, which is interesting, and Prof. Guridy is definitely a good lecturer. But his standards are very high for a lecture course that is basically just about sports. Like, he posts discussion questions about the readings and will randomly call on people in lecture to answer them (sometimes he'll give you time to prepare answers in groups, or sometimes he assigns you to random groups to present in the next class, but sometimes he just cold calls, so you need to have done the reading, and the TAs take notes on everything you say and who answers what). There is a lot of emphasis on participating in class, you can't just show up, you are actually expected to talk in lecture if you want a good grade. Also, you HAVE to go to lecture, because they take attendance, and it really affects your grade. The worst part is definitely the exams, which are take-home, so you think they'll be easy, but they are NOT. It's almost impossible to do well, you have to take super detailed notes and then make sure you don't miss any key terms in the short answers, or you lose points for completely arbitrary things. Also you have to cite like crazy or you lose more points. The exams don't actually require you to do any research or anything, but if you don't have good notes or you weren't paying attention in class you're kind of screwed because they basically ask you to say exactly what he said in lecture. So it's a really mixed bag in terms of the actual effort you need to put into this class -- the lectures are chill (as long as you're prepared to answer a question he might ask) but then the exams are kind of a nightmare, and a lot of people did poorly. There is opportunity for extra credit though, and Prof. Guridy is entertaining and knowledgable (and he's a clear lecturer, like the concepts are explained well). But I hear he does take-home exams in all his classes, which I imagine are as rigidly graded. So just be aware -- if you think this is an easy class where you get to talk about sports, it's not.

This is a great class, and Professor Platt is absolutely wonderful. Definitely recommended for anyone who wants Shakespeare to feel accessible and not too strenuous. Platt is the nicest guy, and his enthusiasm for the material is contagious, so you're motivated to do well and get deeper into the texts (though you can skate by with the minimum if you want, since participation isn't mandatory). But he really encourages class discussion and gets to know everyone's names and creates a great rapport within the class and makes people feel comfortable contributing without letting the discussion spiral in random directions. He's very good at guiding peoples' comments towards relevant points, and he's not afraid to steer the conversation when it's off track, but he genuinely gets excited when someone shares a new idea. He just knows a lot about Shakespeare and really wants to make everyone care as much as he does, and it's a lot of fun to be in a class like that. He also brings out the confusing or funny aspects of the text that might be harder to understand. Overall, highly, highly recommended -- Platt is just a really nice person (he brought us cookies to the final) and genuinely wants everyone to do well and will try to accommodate you as much as possible (extra credit options for people who did poorly on the midterm) and generally make your experience in his class as positive as it can be.

Absolutely the worst...If you have to take this course for your requirement, take it with ANYONE ELSE BUT HIM. He is ineffective in every single sense. He is unclear about the material. His lectures are straight out of the textbook, and somehow they are even more boring that just reading the book. His exams are tough and he does not adequately prepare you for them...he assigns very few problem sets and 0 additional practice problems. I felt so bad for the TAs for this course. He told us on the first day of class that he doesn't reply to email, so don't email him, and then didnt provide any other way to communicate with him...He tells us to be responsible for all the material in the book, which is pages upon pages of minutiae, any of which could come up on the exam. When there were finally practice problems provided for the final (less than a week before), they were either extremely hard or too easy. No one knew what to expect. He doesn't even cover everything that we should be ""responsible for"" in the lectures. He is unresponsive, boring, and an awful teacher.

Professor Chong is phenomenal. He's by far the best Prof. I've had at this school, and I'm almost done with my time here. Obviously, CC is what you make of it, but if you're the kind of person who is even marginally interested in the reading list, then you're in luck, because Prof. Chong's class will be amazing and give you exceptional insights into the texts. Prof. Chong is incredibly knowledgable (he's a music scholar but he knows more about philosophy than the philosophy department), and has the ability to elucidate crucial themes and explain them in a way that stays with you after the class is over (you're never going to forget what Nietzsche was trying to say after Prof. Chong's lecture about it). He makes you actually care about what you're reading, because he shows you why it's relevant for understanding the way our society works now, which is supposed to be the point of CC, even if the course usually doesn't seem to have that effect on people. His class is the answer to the ""why are all these dead white guys on the syllabus"" question, because he demonstrates the way that Western philosophical thought builds on itself, and he connects it to important historical events, as well as modern examples and broader moral questions. Basically, Prof. Chong can give you a more engaging and rewarding overview of why Western Civilization works the way it does than any actual history or philosophy class at this school. 
Prof. Chong is also an extremely approachable, respectful and organized person, and he puts a ton of effort into his class preparation, so you feel like the workload for the students and Prof. is completely reciprocal. He's enthusiastic and humorous and makes class entertaining (the two hours never felt too long) but he's also a serious lecturer: he wants you to take something away from the course that will impact your life and worldview, and his teaching style turns a core class that could be tedious into an experience where you feel like you're actually investigating important ethical and historical topics. He strikes a good balance between class discussion and more lecture-based exposition, which is helpful since the texts can be dense and it's nice to have a guiding thematic outline of what's going on. He compiles useful handouts about the readings when they're challenging (Kant), and uses outside material like art and music to bring themes together (Wagner and Nietzsche on aesthetics, Hamilton for the American founding documents). He is always available to meet with students about papers, and will help you formulate a topic or a thesis if you make the effort to ask. He is also extremely flexible about giving paper extensions (if you ask him, he'll grant it, including extending it beyond the final exam). He's a fair and straight-forward grader, and will give you good comments and advice on your writing. He also meets with every student after the first paper to discuss how you're doing in class -- he definitely rewards effort, and will take into account people who are trying to improve. 
Basically, Prof. Chong will give you all the tools you need to succeed in his class, since he's clear about his expectations, (which are very reasonable and standard for CC), as well as the motivation to succeed, since his lectures are so dynamic that they make you want to put in the effort to actually understand (and read) the texts. He takes CC seriously and makes you want to take it seriously too, and I think he instilled in the class a genuine appreciation for what we studied and why it matters so much. I cannot recommend Prof. Chong highly enough.

Wanted to add a more recent review, just to reiterate what other people have said (many years ago) -- Prof. Skelly is one of the best parts of Columbia and everything that a good music instructor should be. He doesn't demand too much, since he knows that people have limited access to pianos for practicing, not to mention a ton of other priorities, so he encourages you to go at your own pace and learn pieces that matter to you, but he always keeps you motivated to improve. He is supportive and encouraging and genuinely cares about his students, and if you take lessons with him for more than a semester, you will be grateful to have him as a point of constancy in the turbulent Columbia community. He strikes a good balance between technical and interpretative instruction, and lets you go in any direction you want with the pieces (learning something beyond your level just for the fun of it is okay with him). Overall, a great musical experience without too much pressure but a lot of rewards.

(FYI: compared to the other intro to psych classes this class was not curved and did not offer extra credit.)

Professor Mukherjee is the best!! She is brilliant, super devoted to her students, has tons of office hours, and is always willing to give extra help outside of class time.

Professor Zeitlin is without a doubt the worst professor I've had so far at Columbia. His lectures are incoherent and he might as well be talking to an empty room for all the student engagement he inspires. Also, his lectures just consist of him writing the same examples that are done out in the textbook on the board, so most people don't even show up to his class.
 He makes fun of students who ask him to explain something again or who ask questions in his class, and likes to talk a lot about how ""obvious"" various proofs are.  He's also really into putting trick questions on midterms and finals, and will never be willing to tell you which concepts to study before tests. PLEASE do yourself a favor and avoid this guy at all costs :(
Workload:
Workload for this class varied quite a bit. There was a problem set every week, usually about 20 fairly long multi-step problem, and always involving proofs to some extent. Some problem sets were short and painless, and others took forever and involved huge mathematical leaps from class material which were pretty unreasonable to expect from us.  Zeitlin doesn't use Webassign. His midterms and final are hard, but curved. He likes trick questions.

DO NOT TAKE. 
Simply the worst math class I have ever taken. The lecture's are boring, scattered, and are entirely untethered from the book. Bayer does not teach you concepts, only methods with no reasoning. There are no theorems, no explanations. Just him working through problems trying to convey a method. The TA's themselves frequently do not know how to explain the methods he uses other than ""that's the bayer way of doing it."" You are left entirely confused, and have to study by essentially trying to copy the method from his answer sheets until you get the method.
If you are taking this as a quant major, it isn't worth it -- you will need linear algebra down the road, and this will not teach you it.  If you are taking this as a non-major looking to try out an easier, useful non-calc math class, you will also be hugely disappointed. Although it is true that this class is well-curved (typically, almost a 50% A-range), it is so incomprehensible that you will really struggle. In fact, the A-range fact is somewhat misleading, because an extraordinarily large number of students drop out by the midterm because of his terrible teaching style, leaving only those quant majors who are able to get by.

Professor Bayer is clearly an extremely intelligent guy. However, this class is not for you if you're not willing to self study the material. Bayer jumps right into linear algebra and doesn't really explain the basic concepts very clearly in lecture. If you're smart, learn them beforehand. If not, cram them the night before the midterm. 
The midterms are very straightforward and the study guides Bayer puts together are very helpful. There are generally over fifty questions with worked out solutions that'll give you a pretty good hint as to what you'll see on the exam. Exam grades are usually very good and it's not hard to get an A--seeing as Bayer gives out as many as he possibly can (!!!). The midterms aren't cumulative, but the material builds on itself so it essentially is. 
In terms of homework there hardly is any. Bayer will assign roughly 10 or 20 questions due at each midterm and 4 or 5 due before the final. The questions come out of the book and usually don't look anything like what you'd see on an exam so it's pretty easy to do the day before it's due.

Professor Hansen's class is a lot of work. Before each weekly lecture, Professor Hansen would post videos that would ""cover"" the material that was to be gone over during lecture. The videos varied in length from a minute to over twenty and there would usually be four or five videos to watch. In lecture, there was usually a weekly quiz and then this period of 50 minutes where Professor Hansen would ask everyone to solve questions on material that was only covered in the assigned videos. The TA's were completely unhelpful during lecture and would usually respond to questions with ""didn't you watch the videos?""
Expect to put a lot of time into this class. With any section of gen chem lab expect to devote a few hours to writing your pre lab report, studying for the weekly quizzes, and actually going to a potentially four hour lab. However, if you're in Professor Hansen's section expect to double that. You are going to be responsible for most of the learning you do.

This class is not easy. There is a LOT of material. In lecture, Professor Dieker goes through a number of concepts usually covering definitions and equations relevant to the material. There's usually a nice two minute break somewhere in lecture as well. However, when it comes time to do your homework you're going to wish you had more examples in your notes. The weekly homework assignments are usually around 10 problems in length. They're usually pretty difficult and are much more challenging than the material presented in class. Expect to spend a good amount of time on each assignment. 
The two midterms are difficult. However, if you begin studying a decent amount of time in advance you'll be fine. Part of what makes the exams (and particularly the final) difficult is the sheer amount of memorization you're going to be required to do. Also be prepared to handle double integrals. Calculus is very much a pre-req for this class and you're going to be doing a lot of integrating. Brushing up on your series and sequences is also not a bad idea.

Kat's the absolute BEST! She's really chill, funny, and she's just an overall pleasure to be around. She has a fantastic attitude toward her job in ensuring that our conversations were dynamic, productive, and applicable- not esoteric, too philosophical, or difficult to relate to- as can be the case when discussing some of the works that established the way we currently think and learn. She also loves group collaboration, so many times instead of just having one long extensive conversation about a book, we would break up into smaller groups; and each group concentrated on a particular theme or event- later presenting to the entire class. Kat's also a pretty generous grader; she has a simple set of expectations, but if you don't take her incredibly helpful comments seriously to actually improve your writing- you can easily end up with the same mediocre grade on each paper. Kat also seems a bit disenfranchised with the whole ""core mentality."" She doesn't really buy into the whole idea of everyone having the exact same final, which made her expectations for the exam slightly unclear. Regardless, after spending so much class time with her, you get to understand what she expects and all is well. Also, Kat's just an incredibly pleasant person- and likes to make sure everyone has a part in the discussion- so even when people spew absolute nonsense, she never rejects or shuts people down (which probably doesn't do those people any favors). Either way, if you're lucky enough to get Kat- enjoy! You'll have an incredibly positive experience. And, as Kat loves to say... Cheers!

He is frank, open and tries his best to ensure that nobody does really bad in his class. My major concern with the course was that while the first half was linear prog and a basic intro to convex optimization, the second half contained integer, Quadratic, non linear as well as dynamic and all of this was on the finals.
You can definitely take this but be prepared to spend 10 - 15 hours per week minimum easily if you wanna do well.

Worst professor ever. Let me list a few enlightening qualities of Mr. Martin
1. Doesn't know much about anything but acts as if he is like Prof. Derman ( Too much ego )
2. Basically rehashes materials from all his courses
3. If all things are pretty obvious, I don't understand why we need you to tell that to us Martin
4. Least helpful guy who you would ever have the displeasure to meet
5. He said he had some fun stories to share about Peter Carr who he thinks is not that great ( Do people even that you exist Martin ? ) - Basically thinks he is better than the best.
6. Look at his linked in profile and tell me why is he is in anyway qualified to teach here ( where you get the cream of the crop ). I think the the only reason he is still not fired is that he sucks up a lot to the chair presumably.
Now the only redeeming quality is that the course is good and seems to be well thought out. Just because the material is good doesn't mean you don't need to teach and get away with everything.

Barraquand is a less than stellar teacher. He speaks in French-English, talks directly to the board, and takes notes right out of the textbook like you could do yourself. He likes to make up homework and exam questions that are either insanely difficult or don't have actual solutions. His written homework problems confused the TAs and himself at times. Right before midterms and the exam he taught us crazy concepts that never showed up anywhere in the course, and would often give one section much harder questions than the other on midterms. He provides one practice midterm for each midterm and one practice final, all of which have questions that he later deems ""too difficult"" during in-class review.

Unfortunately, this question goes miles out of the boundary of what we learned, making it impossiblé to get a good grade.

Jeff is a pretty cool guy. I honestly really liked his class, but maybe just because he matches my teaching style. Needless to say, I did drift to sleep in a few of his classes. Jeff basically writes out EVERYTHING on the board, so I didn't even have to buy the textbook, since he plainly says everything you need to know. Of course it does get a little boring sometimes (especially if you hate math), but it is really helpful and leads to organized notes.
Jeff skips the chapter on limits and continuity, which but pretty great since that isn't a particularly great part of the course, anyway.

I took this class as a first-year my first semester of college. I can't say anything bad about Professor Suarez-Garcia; he is definietly deserving of a silver nugget. This class is specifically designed for heritage speakers, which means that the class is composed of Latinos and Hispanics. You will be required to speak Spanish during the entire hour and fifteen minutes, but since you would only be taking this course as a native Spanish speaker, speaking it fluently shouldn't be an issue. However, Professor Suarez-Garcia does not grade you based on how you speak the language, in fact, he openly states that even though he is from Spain, he does not believe that Spanish from Spain is best, which is incredibly comforting. The course itself is focused on grammar and learning how to perfect the language so that it is spoken ""formally"" instead of ""colloquially"". Even though grammar was a large part of the course, Professor Suarez-Garica also incorporated topics that had nothing to do with grammar, which was the basis of three short essays that we had to write. Throughout the entire semester, the Professor was always willing to answer our questions. He is also very flexible regarding due dates and grades.

Professor Harel's class is a really interesting look at the world of Hebrew literature through various forms of media. She is a very kind person and really wants you to do well in the class. 
As someone who has not been in a formal Hebrew class since graduating middle school, she provided me with an opportunity to continue developing my language skills through a humanities approach to language. I loved reading all of the selections and watching various TV shows and movies. My skills as both a writer and critical thinker (in Hebrew) really improved throughout the semester. The pieces covered a range of interesting topics that both expanded our vocabulary, and gave us some more insight into Israeli culture. 
Professor Harel was also an incredibly approachable professor who was always willing to answer any questions about the course, be it about content or fixing grammar mistakes for the exams. 
I highly recommend taking this course, even if you have placed out of Hebrew or have finished the initial 4 semesters. There is still a lot you can gain from this class. 
Workload:
Super manageable! Professor Harel typically assigns a reading or a show/movie to be watched before each class. You then spend the entirety of class time discussing it. 
Professor Harel gives 3 exams and 3 vocab quizzes. The vocab quizzes come from a list of words she gives you ahead of time, and it is a fill-in-the blank test with a word bank at the bottom. Her exams are 600-word typed responses (in class) to 2 of a list of questions she provides. Most of the questions are things that have been discussed at length in class. You are allowed to both have the source in front of you, as well as a dictionary. After the exam is graded (on grammar and content), she will allow you to edit your grammar for the average of your grammar score back. 
There is also a presentation at the end of the semester, but no final exam!

If you spend a little time on this class each day there is no reason why this shouldn't be an easy A, I was told...by the professor. I thought to myself, sounds good to me, I am interested in learning Japanese and I am more than willing to put in the work every day to learn. Boy was that statement wrong. What it should have said was, ""If you have already taken multiple courses in Japanese, know all the Kanji, and have an exceptional talent for learning eastern languages, you will surely be just fine."" That is quite a shame really, because this is touted as an introductory Japanese course for people that have little to know experience with any part of the Japanese language. 
I'm sure if you came into this class having a good grasp on the introductory parts of the Japanese language you would do just fine. By that I mean, you know your hiragana, katakana, some Kanji, and basic sentence structures and particle usage. However, if you know none of this you are in for a rude awakening. Having known only words like sushi, sashimi, and teriyaki, I wasn't exactly well versed in Japanese. So that simple work load each night was more like 2 - 4 hours a night, every single night just to keep up. Not to mention that you had to memorize a list of vocab and sentence structures for a quiz every single day at the start of class. After the first month or two the whole class was basically begging for the course load to slow down. We even let our professor know that we just couldn't keep up and we felt that our Japanese language learning was suffering because of it. By two months in, nothing slowed down, and it become quite evident that people were beginning to be overwhelmed. Constantly relying on the textbook in class just to remember basic words and sentence structures. Many people, my self included, saw a noticeable decline in the amount of time spent on other classes because of the time required for this class. Tatsumi-sensei, specifically stated that the Columbia Japanese department specifically tries to go 1.5 times faster than the average college. Why? Is there research stating that, that helps us learn? I'd venture to say not, but they seem to like that arbitrary rate of learning because, ""it's an elite college"". Great, elite college, that's fine and dandy but I would sure love to learn something. 
Overall, despite the class being completely at the whim of the department as a whole rather than tailored to the pace of each class, Tatsumi-sensei did his best. He is not a bad professor by any means, and really does care about his students. If you get a mid to low B on a test he will call you into his office to go over the test with you, which is nice, but also somewhat alarming the first time it happens. However, you better hope that you are an auditory learner because you will have little visual material to learn from and almost no time to take notes. However, as I said, if you are like the 80% of class that has already studied Japanese or knows a bunch of Kanji and similar languages, then you'll be fine. If that doesn't describe you, best of luck, you are going to need it!

First let me start off by saying that this class is largely dependent on who you TA is, if you get Andrew Davison, I wish you all the luck in the world. The material covered in this class can be pretty confusing mostly due to the awkward wording and multiple ways of interpreting various questions. On tests it really comes down to trying to figure out what the TA was trying to ask, and building your answer around that assumption. 
Professor Lo, has his quirks, and isn't exactly the best professor I've ever encountered. Most of his lectures are quite confusing and are often a waste of time. Every once in awhile there are a few gems in there so best to show up at least 50% of the time. Without a doubt he cares a lot about the subject, but just can't seem to get a point across unless on the rare occasion he decides to talk about a real world example from research he has done. What he lacks in teaching skills though, he makes up for in understanding, as long as you are willing to honestly let him know how the class and tests are going for you. Otherwise, because of his incredibly hands off approach to this class you are going to get crushed. To illustrate this, I emailed him on a number of occasions and never heard back. Everything, including the tests, are left up to his TA. Why is that so important? Because when you get a super probability genius TA PhD candidate from Cambridge, you are in for a world of hurt on the tests. For both our midterms the class average hovered around a median of 50%. About 2/3 of the class scored a little below that mark, but there were some outliers. Many people had around a 30% - 40% on both midterms. Not a single person finished either midterm, and many only finished about a half of it or a little more in the 75 minute time span. Because professor Lo is so understanding though, he took our pain to heart and created a drastic curve, and the final ended up being slightly easier, but still low (or should I say Lo...) grades overall. 
Makes sure you know who your TA is for this class before committing. Ultimately, you should be ok though, if not a bit demoralized. Wikipedia and Chegg Study will be your friend, because the textbook isn't the best in helping fill the gaps in knowledge from the class.

At first I was puzzled why professor Stokes was highly rated. She talked so quietly she was barely audible, and her notes on the board were (in the words of a classmate) ""a disaster."" I considered bailing, but after a whole semester I'm glad I stayed. While her lectures stayed a bit difficult to follow, it wasn't hard to make sense of them by looking over my notes after the fact. She was actually a deceptively good teacher, and very fair. She only tested on material presented in class (didn't need to buy the textbook), and didn't ask trick questions. The material was fascinating, and more neuroscience-oriented than I'd expected for an Intro to Psych class. We learned a lot about learning (which is her specialty) and stress, which were both very practical for students. I'd definitely recommend this class to anyone (well, maybe not to the hearing impaired!) even if you think you're not interested in psychology.
Workload:
Not bad. Three exam: two midterms and a final. Each midterm includes a take-home essay, plus an extra credit take-home essay. With the extra credit it isn't hard to get a 100 on the exams. For the final she gave us three essays through the last weeks of class, basically summing up the lectures about a particular subject and applying it to a specific case. The final exam was brief. The essays weren't hard, and forced us to learn the material well, which made the exams easier.

This class was, without a doubt, one of the more interesting and fun classes that I have taken throughout my college career. Your homework is to watch a famous anime film or a couple episodes of a series, read a dense 100 pages or so of anthropological writings and then she will generally give you a prompt for which you have to write a one to two page, single spaced paper. Nothing terribly difficult. She just gives you a check or check + depending on your analysis. Beware though, this may be a class that is fun and games most of the time, but Professor Ivy expects you to put forth a strong effort both in and out of class. Make sure you come well prepared to speak in class and on the papers, even if she says something simple like give a short reaction to a film, make sure you put a lot of thought into it and support it with text from the readings that week. 
With that said, early on professor Ivy can come off as somewhat of a cranky old woman, but beneath that stoic exterior she is actually a very caring individual. She is certainly very knowledgeable about the subject of anime and its effect on Japanese media and culture, and shares some strong opinions about various topics. This might be my one criticism of Professor Ivy. Because she has such strong, well researched opinions, she can sometimes be dismissive of students with differing opinions on a subject. Regardless, you end up learning a whole lot from her about Japan, Japanese media, the history and techniques behind anime, and the forces of anime on the various mass subcultures of Japan. I'm quite surprised this isn't a global core to be honest.
You only have to do one final paper 15 page paper, double spaced, and its contents are completely up to you. I recommend picking a topic that is relatively broad and can be supported using a lot of the text from the semester. She does reward you for digging deep into very specific analysis though, but might require more time spent on researching good quotes and supporting evidence. Basically, just participate regularly in class, and have go to supporting evidence and you will be just fine.

This course starts out really basic. If you have some common sense, and/or know the differences between: a sample and a population, discrete and continuous data, and surveys, observational studies, and randomized experiments, then you can skip the first eight lectures. 
Then the class suddenly kicks into high gear with hypothesis testing, normal curves, confidence intervals etc. It's not really hard material but it took me a while to understand in which situation I would do which test, and why. 
Cohen is a really nice Guy, and really makes an effort to be helpful, but I found his slides and lectures to be more confusing than helpful. He was a career statistician, and understands the material inside-out, but does a poor job presenting it in a simple, coherent manner. We learned a modest amount of material overall, which could have meant a chill class if it'd been covered thoroughly and concisely. Instead it was scattered, confusing, and repetitive, and it wasn't until the end that I realized what fit where, and that I actually hadn't learned much. This class is probably easier if you skip consistently. I made the mistake of attending every class.
Fortunately Cohen is a very fair grader, and the exams are open notes. The two projects are very straightforward. If you're looking for a skippable class that gives you the basics, go for it.

Prof. Lu knows corruption extremely well -- but only corruption in China. He plays favorites with Chinese students almost as if to exemplify the very concepts of amoral familialism and guanxi he discusses in class. 
I have taken two classes with Prof. Lu and I have never gotten a terrible grade from him, but his grading is so arbitrary that he bumps grades and lowers them after individual complaints from students. Do not take a class with him if you expect him to read your papers and give you a grade you deserve. He does not care about the work of his students. His expectations are unfathomable and changeable. If you can settle for an A- or B+ and would like to get one just by playing nice with the professor, and don't mind not learning anything in your class, take this course. If you'd enjoy a challenging class, and a professor who can improve your knowledge of a field, and give you a grade that matches your hard work, then do not take this class.

Unenthusiastic lecturer. Cynical, jaded, touchy, passive aggressive. Plays favorites and anti-favorites. Indulges people who ramble on and on unproductively in class.
Seemed like he was really not invested in teaching. Would roll his eyes in boredom after he finished reading off his script. 
Grades papers in weird way. His grading scheme is streamlined for minimal effort on his part/his TA's part. Doesn't give a damn about quality of ideas--if your paper fits his required, formulaic structure, you'll get an A. And if it doesn't fit THAT STRUCTURE to a tee, you'll get a B. Even if everything else is there. In other words, the papers are not graded based on content. They're graded based on how well they fit his mold.

I took General Chemistry I with Professor Savisky in Fall 2016.
The lectures in this class are fine, but I didn't find them particularly helpful. Savisky generally just regurgitated all the information that was on the lecture slides, which he posts online. If he did add any additional information, it generally was not all that helpful. He does crack a few jokes though. Essentially, you don't need to attend lectures to get a good grade in this class.
Something that I found really helpful in this class was the amount of study material Savisky gave you (practice problems and previous exams). They really helped you get an idea of what the exams would be like and helped prepare you for the quizzes. I found using the solutions manual to check your answers for the practice problems to be a productive way to learn and practice the concepts taught in class. Just studying the practice problems from Zumdahl is sufficient. I didn't study any of the recommended textbooks, and it was fine. The lecture slides can also be a good way to review all the concepts, but I didn't use them as my primary source of information. Online resources (e.g., Khan Academy) were pretty good at explaining complicated topics.
The exams can be tricky, but they're quite manageable if you had previously practiced with previous years' exams. I didn't really attend office hours, but Savisky and the TAs hold them quite often, so you could ask them questions from the previous exams and practice problems if you need help or clarification. I think the difficultly of the quizzes varies with each TA. I found the quizzes my TA gave to be particularly easy, especially if you had done each week's practice problems, but they probably were harder in other TAs' recitations. The practice problems are never due for a grade.
All in all, this was a fine and fair class. Savisky explains how grades work during the first lecture, and I think his approach towards the curve and normalization is pretty fair.

10+ hours/week
This could probably be a lot less, but I really tried to fully utilize all the given resources. Also, if you've already adequately learned all the concepts taught in this class in AP Chemistry, this course shouldn't take you a lot of time. For full disclosure, I got an A+ in the course.

Jae is an excellent lecturer who is very clear about his explanations. Even though his lecture notes are already quite good, it's definitely worth it to come to lectures, since Jae provides useful supplementary information and also runs sample code so one can see how the code exactly works. 
The TAs are also very willing to help you with the code (as long as you put in the effort, of course). The recitations are more or less just review of the lectures, but if you want more practice or sample code, it's good to check them out.
The exams are quite tricky. The best way to prepare is to definitely read all of the lecture notes very carefully (VERY CAREFULLY), understand exactly what each line of code does, understand how each lab works, and read K&R or the C++ book carefully. It might even be helpful to write and run your own code to ensure you know what is happening. Furthermore, Jae might reuse exam questions from the previous midterms, so definitely learn from your mistakes. 
The labs vary in difficulty. As long as you have the proper prerequisites (Data Structures, some familiarity working with UNIX commands and hopefully Vim/Emacs, and good coding habits) and as long as you follow along in class, the labs will be straightforward. Pointers are actually not that difficult if you follow along and draw pictures. The hardest lab is lab 7 in which you have to write a web server. It's not difficult conceptually, but it's difficult because there are many parts you have to keep track of. Make sure you debug your code constantly (instead of writing the whole lab in one shot) and get started early! Be sure you do well on the labs, since the averages for labs, unlike those for exams, are usually very high. 
Personally I thought the listserv was a giant clusterfuck. However, if you care enough to look through all of the emails (questions about the labs, questions that have already been asked, emails from TAs exasperated at people who repeat the same questions), you can gain some useful tips for finishing labs or figuring out exam questions. Just make sure you search for your question before you create a new email, and don't reply-all to announcement emails. It's essential that you set up an inbox filter to filter all of these emails.

McWhorter is a fantastic and extremely engaging lecturer. Not only is he clear about linguistics concepts but he also illustrates them through very interesting, relevant, and sometimes personal examples. I was actually excited to come to class each day because I knew it would be a treat.
The TAs for this course were also awesome. They led many review sessions and provided useful tips for succeeding on the exams. Their office hours were also fantastic for understanding how to do the homework.
The problem sets can be slightly challenging and tricky. They definitely force you to apply the concepts that you have learned in class and to think logically. However, if you come to office hours, they all become very understandable. The exams are extremely straightforward and actually easier than the problem sets. As long as you put in an honest effort into the problem sets, the exams are very easy.

Edstrom is a good lecturer and discussion leader. In class, she will make an effort to foster discussion on topics instead of merely lecturing the entire time. It's also very nice to see her embody the same constructivist and progressive teaching principles she teaches about into her own teaching in this class. For example, she encourages discussions and urges students to create their own meaning from the readings, she integrates mathematics with social justice issues, and she presents ideas through multimedia, such as videos or classroom tools (having us work with tools elementary school students might use in their classes). 
Unfortunately, I thought the course was quite disorganized. Even though there was a syllabus, we didn't always cover the readings as specified on a certain day. Furthermore, there wasn't much guidance provided for planning the field trip (a major part of the grade), and the time frame was extremely narrow (it's tough to schedule field trips on such short notice, given the partner teachers' schedules). I would've appreciated more time devoted to planning a field trip (not a trivial task) and a clearer roadmap for the course.
Also, some of the course tasks seemed quite trivial. For example, we all had to keep journals for our fieldwork observations and for class notes. What was strange is that a good portion of the notebook grade came from decorating your notebook and making it pretty which...was odd. At times I felt like I was actually in a 3rd grade classroom!
The fieldwork component is also quite time-consuming (30 hours for the semester for education studies, 40 hours for urban teaching). I really enjoyed my placement, but be sure you have the time for the fieldwork, especially if you are placed in a school far from Columbia.

Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Hopefully she never teaches this class in future semesters.
Everyone in the class CLEARLY had already taken some amount of German, but refused to admit this to the instructor. (They admitted it amongst themselves.) 
AND, STRANGE ENOUGH, the instructor did not seem to (or maybe just REFUSED) to put two and two together. After I went up to her to say I was worried about keeping up given that the pace was so fast, she laughed....saying that everyone else was in the same boat as I was (false haha) and they just got the language better than I did (um...) 
I ask you HOW can students be able to converse in German after  LITERALLY spending two nights with their first textbook to learn one chapter? Where would we have grasped ANYTHING besides the vocabulary written on the page, and basic sentence structures (of which there were VERY FEW)?  
My friend ended up dropping the class after she had already purchased the textbook, because Miriam's classroom expectations were unclear, and ultimately unreasonable. No one expects to be babied. But true introductory students of German expect the instructor to do some of the explaining herself. We do not need an instructor looking to coast with students whose previous German teachers have done the bulk of the work.

I took Professor Lawrence's primates class last summer and absolutely loved it. I am not a science person at all, so I took this class purely for a science requirement. Let me say that this was my favorite class that I've taken at Columbia, and Professor Lawrence is one of my favorite professors. She is an incredible lecturer, and the 2-3 hour classes were easy to sit through because of it. (Note 2-3 hours - many of the classes did not go the entire 3 hours, and the lecture portion did not usually exceed 1-1.5 hours if I remember correctly.) She delivers the information very clearly, and as long as you write down what she says and pay attention in class you should have no problem getting an A. I, like most others, did not do well on the taxonomy quiz. However, it's not worth a whole lot, so don't worry if you don't do well - you can still get an A. Oh, and before I forget, YOU DO NOT NEED TO READ THE TEXTBOOK. Just go to class and take notes (on the movies too since she always includes a question on exams about the movies) and you'll be fine. I wish every class was like this class, and every professor like Professor Lawrence. She is so much fun and extremely approachable, and a great lecturer to boot. Bottom line is you should take this class regardless of whether or not you like science or primates.

Emily Sun is a GODDESS. She is kind, engaging, and wise, and truly wants the best for each student.  The reading list for this class is fantastic - I actually wanted to do all of the reading!!!  The syllabus is also well created, the order in which things are read and the way she has broken the class into units gives the good readings even more meaning. Because it is a smaller class and runs like a seminar, it depends a bit who is in your class and how much reading/ speaking they do as to how the discussions run, but Professor Sun always has interesting questions and thinking points.

I have very mixed feelings about this class. The topic itself is very interesting to me, and I did many of the readings and was really fascinated. Most of Becher's lectures were also insightful - she is clearly so so smart and has a lot of knowledge to share, but sometimes the class would feel really loose, almost like she wasn't prepared. Overall though, the readings and the lectures were the good parts of this class for me, and I do think I learned a lot of useful information. 
6 or 7 of the lecture days were given up as group work days.  While the group work was sometimes helpful, I think there was too much of it, I would have preferred a bit more lecture by Becher. Even on days when she did lecture, she would often open up the floor to us, asking us questions, but I found this to be very problematic, because either no one would answer and she would get frustrated (instead of just answering her question herself), or someone would answer, and very often she would push them on their answers and go head to head with students. This wasn't like nice, academic discourse, it was really a professor arguing down a student. I felt afraid to speak in her class because I didn't want her to argue with me in front of the entire room. 
The written assignments for this class were my biggest problem. The prompts were very specific but also convoluted, and I had a lot of trouble understanding what Becher was going for. They require a great deal of time in the preparation/ research phase, Becher asks for very specific kinds of sources as well. Grade wise, these assignments end up carrying by far the most weight, and my confusion with the prompts ended up killing my grade in this class. 
She also really didn't seem to care about piling the work on at times. We would have weeks where we would have a written assignment due at 5 pm on Sunday and a group paper due the next morning for which we had to read an entire book and watch a movie (and then work on our portion of the paper.) All in all, I learned a lot in this class but it was a lot of work and there were many frustrating aspects.

I came into this class with a slight interest in Anthropology, but was mostly taking it because it fit well in my schedule and fulfilled a requirement for my (non-Anthro) major.  I've left this class with about the same level of interest in Anthropology, so this review may not be as relevant for people who already know they like Anthropology - it's just not really my thing.
This class was pretty solid.  I didn't really find myself falling asleep in lecture, but there were only about 2-3 times that I felt that what we spoke about was really cool.  Unfortunately, the readings were pretty long and we ended up only focusing on small ideas from them.  I tried to do the reading at the start of the semester, which was kind of helpful for understanding what we were learning, but ultimately I ended up lightly skimming or just not reading the assigned material since I was busy with other class readings, and I did equally well in the class.  It often felt to me like the class was just about assigning key terms to names and trying to remember the jargon used to define the terms each anthropologist uses.  The size of the class wasn't conducive to discussion, so lectures often became hour-long blocks where I'd write as much information as I could about the vocabulary for each anthropologist and call it a day.  Muir is nice and sometimes funny and the lectures were some of the most organized that I've attended at Columbia, but they are mostly just her talking, and the anthropological vocabulary she used sometimes made the content less meaningful to me since there were a number of terms she often used that I just never really understood and that weren't really explained or were explained using equally confusing terms.  The discussion section I was in consisted of some of the least-useful time I've ever spent at Columbia, thanks to my TA (discussion sections definitely have the potential to be interesting and enriching if you have the right instructor, though).
The upside is that the class is relatively easy.  I came through with an A and really didn't put that much effort in.  The readings, as I said, aren't exactly necessary and are often so long that it's just not worth the time to try to read them if the topics aren't exciting to you.  There are 3 assignments that aren't super time-intensive, some in-class quizzes that are fairly easy if you payed attention during the past couple of lectures, and a midterm and final which involve a hell of a lot of writing for the time given, but that can be a big grade boost if you just put some time into preparing for them.  Attendance is taken at each lecture and discussion section, but if you just show up, take some good notes, and put a little time into your assignments and tests, you'll be totally fine.
Overall, I'd say that I kind of wish that I took a different class to fulfill my major requirement.  Muir is a really nice professor and you can tell that she cares a lot about the subject, but I left the class kind of confused about the take-away and not really caring any more about Anthropology than I did before.  If you're interested in Anthropology and you put time into studying throughout the semester and doing the assigned readings, you'll definitely enjoy the class more than I did.  I've heard great feedback about the course from Anthropology majors, so take this review as you will!

I absolutely loved her Ballet II class!
Her Ballet II is considerably more difficult than her Ballet I class. However, she will tell you at the very beginning of the semester if you are not fit for the class. 
I really liked that she spends 2 weeks on each set of combinations, and that they gradually become harder as the class goes along. Since the combinations were not always new, I was able to focus on improving rather than just memorizing sequences. 
Her feedback is great. She can easily point things out that the class is struggling with, but she also gives great individualized feedback. Don't be afraid of being called out on individually! At first I felt embarrassed every time she would single me out, but she does it to basically everyone, and it really helped me improve. 
On top of all that, she is also very approachable and responsive to emails.

Her class was my absolute favorite in the CS core. 
Her lectures were crystal clear and the workload felt like the perfect amount. It was challenging enough that it would genuinely help me apply my knowledge of the material, but it was not overwhelming like in many of the other CS classes.
This is definitely one of those CS classes you can use to balance out your heavier classes. 
The first half of the class is said to be easier for the Engineering people, and the second half of the class is said to be easier for the CS people. However, I found the first half to be easier (and more interesting/fun), and I am a CS person. So, this may or may not apply to you. 
Professor Kim makes all of her slides available online, so you can take a peek at the material beforehand to get an idea of what the class will be like.
tldr: The class is one of the lightest in the CS dept. She is a clear and approachable lecturer. Take a class with her if you can!

This was hands down the hardest and most time-consuming class I have ever taken at Columbia.
 It was also my favorite. 
If you really enjoyed AP and think you would enjoy getting into the nitty gritty details of Linux, take this class. 
Jae is a good lecturer, but it seems that he is still figuring out how to teach operating systems, so his lectures are not as great as his AP lectures. Still, it shows that he put a lot of thought into the way the class and assignments are laid out. I found the order of the material to be pretty natural and easy to follow, but I'm sure the syllabus is still changing every semester as he figures out how to teach this class. 
Although I found the lectures and readings easy to follow, my team and I really struggled with the homeworks. However, I'll admit that part of the reason that we struggled so much was that we did the readings right before the tests rather than before attempting to do the assignments. So, if you want to make your life easier, do the readings before you get down to coding. There will still be some shooting in the dark involved, but not nearly as much as if you only rely on your knowledge from the lectures. 
That being said, what made the class truly enjoyable was having an amazing team. None of us knew each other before OS, but we became close friends by the end of the semester because we were spending close to 40 hours/week with each other for this class. It seems like an exaggeration, but I promise its true. We got pretty decent grades on most assignments, but we made very little progress on other assignments (despite the crazy amount of hours we dedicated to working on them). 
The tests are classic Jae-style trickiness. The curve was pretty generous though. 
If you are interested in the material and aren't afraid of some hard work, go for it. You are only at Columbia for so long, and you can get a lot out of this class.

If you are an incoming first-year at Barnard, there's no better seminar than this one. She is amazing and the readings are pretty cool. But the readings shouldn't even matter on your decision because it is MARGARET VANDENBURG. She is the most kind, funny, INTELLIGENT and engaging professor ever. She will make you feel more intelligent than you think you are by always encouraging you to speak. She will destroy every concept you think you have (like ""do you believe in nature?"" ""like, trees?"" ""yes, do you believe in it?"" I USED TO NOW I DON'T KNOW QUEEN  ???) and you will leave the class a lot smarter I promise. I can't even put into words how amazing she is. Fair grader and her comments are actually helpful. The class was so much fun and I wish I could take it again. She even took us on a class field trip on reading week just because.

I had the pleasure of taking a course with Professor Guibbory first as a junior, and then for my fall senior seminar. I was wary of her Milton class, as I am an Americanist, but her teaching of his prose and poetry was utterly compelling. It was not easy; this was the first English class in which I found myself truly needing to take notes. And I often met to read and discuss passages from ""Paradise Lost"" outside of class with a friend. Her senior seminar on Sin, Sex, and Spirituality is quite possibly the greatest course I took in college, and stretched and engaged my mind endlessly.
In all, though, neither Milton nor her senior seminar were overly taxing in terms of readings and assignments. And I found that, rather than meandering, her lecturing was flexible enough to embrace the interests of her students while still getting us through the material.

I mostly agree with the reviews below but would add that Bellovin curves down (almost the entire class would have gotten an A or A- this semester based on numerical scores and so to change this a 93 was downgraded to a B+). 
A larger issue not mentioned here is that the assignments lacked foresight and the grading seemed arbitrary. There were several instances when instructions had to be clarified at the last minute before something was due or the rubric itself was incorrect and the grade assigned needed to be revised. 
A fourth homework was assigned during the week of final exams which should have been announced earlier or released during the semester. I also think it's better policy to make the course requirements more challenging and curve up than to make the requirements trivial and to curve down (this is especially true when based on the results of a final that students cannot see since the semester is over).
Not an incredibly demanding course but not particularly substantive or rewarding either.

Professor Howley really is the best professor one can ask for. He is a very very very nice person, someone who always genuinely cares about his students. He's a classics professor with a specialisation in Roman literature, so he can actually connect Latin/Greeks words and Roman history with what we are reading. When the class went to the MET together we all saw how obsessed he is with his stuffs.  His class is truly engaging, in some magical way everyone actively participates. There's not a sense of dullness in his class at all, never. Professor Howley has a ton of personal charm, it's never boring to talk to him/be in his class. He really knows his stuffs but never appears to be condescending or lecturing. Also, he's very loose with extensions, if you ask, there's no way he won't give you a lot more time to write as long as you tell him what happened. He also is a very fair grader, mostly people get A- on papers and same with midterm, but he ends up giving higher final grades. Not that he's just laid back, but he really knows how to encourage students and make sure they are rigorously trained at the same time. He's strict when he needs to. If you get him as your lit hum professor I'm impressed by how lucky you are. Or if you are taking a classics class, I strongly recommend you take it with him. He's a perfect professor in every sense, whether you are just starting to get into classics or deeply familiar with the material. Everyone in my lit hum class LOVES professor Howley, have never seen any exception.

Seriously incredible professor. Like, the best professor you're likely to have at Columbia. He WILL make you want to be a Philosophy major. This class is no joke though, and neither is Hegel. It's more work than any other philosophy course I've taken, even though the reading is usually just a couple of pages. The material is difficult, and requires a lot of time to seriously digest. It is essential to go to every single class, and write down pretty much everything Neuhouser says. Only when you're writing your paper and go back to those notes do you realize how well he has deconstructed the text. 
Grading: he says on the syllabus that satisfactory work will receive a B, and only good work will receive an A. His grading is on the harsher side of fair, but still isnt too bad. If you put in the work, there's no reason not to receive at least an A-. Also, if you do better in the final than the midterm, the midterm isnt counted for your grade. If your second paper is better than your first, then it counts for double your first paper. The comments are constructive and helpful, and the midterm and final are seriously straightforward. 
The main thing to remember, as others have noted, is not to pad your writing. Be AS clear and succinct as possible, and write to the point. For inspiration, use his own paper on the Structure of Hegel's Philosophy of Right. 
Neuhouser will change your life. He is the most caring, giving and motivating professor most of his students have ever had. I only wish I had taken his class sooner so that I could take his other ones before graduating too.

Disclaimer: I took Calculus BC in high school and did well in the class. 
Alright, the first thing that you need to know is that di Cerbo is a bit of a mixed bag. But the dude knows his shit. Seriously, go to youtube and find his video on birational geometry. If you can get past the 20 minute mark, get the hell outta Calc I and go to Honors Math. 
Anyways, di Cerbo is a pretty average math teacher. When talking about Mean Value Theorem, or the FTC, or Intermediate Value Theorem, or Squeeze Theorem, he always does a proof. This can be either good or bad - if you find value in the proof of a theorem, and that helps you understand, then great. If not, you can just snooze for 20 minutes in the classes where he introduces them. One plus point: He always brings a lot of examples to the table in class. The structure will almost always be ""Prove the theorem, example problem, example problem, example problem...."" These examples increase in difficulty and correlate very closely to the homework problems. 
That all being said, he has some negatives too. He tends to rush through his algebra, which can leave some of the class behind. He's got no problem skipping 2 or 3 algebraic steps every so often. But it doesnt happen enough to be a serious issue, so I wouldnt worry about it. He can assign ridiculously tedious homework (one of them was 10 problems of finding the first and second derivative, inflection points, concavity, asymptotes, intercepts, the works) and his TAs can be dicks with the grading. But the midterm and final aren't horrific, so I'll give him a pass.
Honestly, he isn't stellar, but if you're stuck with him, know that he won't try to screw you.

First of all, there is no doubt that this course is taught more rigorously than other Orgo classes (i.e. doubleday and cornish). But Phillips is ok. She's a good teacher, she explains the material well, although she spent an about 2-3 weeks just talking about hybridization -_- and then powered through enantiomers and stereoisomers like they're common knowledge. I never once opened McMurry so when I switch to d-day, I'll have a weird new relationship with McMurry. Even though she doesn't teach straight outta McMurry, it's ok because you actually learn more of the important mechanisms that she thinks are relevant to synthesis (orgo2). never did learn how to make a cyclopropane from an alkene so that's kinda disappointing, cause she taught that at Hunter. Second, I learned how to answer 11 difficult orgo problems in 75 minutes (5 of which are mechanism questions)... wait scratch that, I really didn't. I usually get one whole-page wrong cause guess what 75min IS NOT ENOUGH!!! It's not like her multiple choice don't take time... so if she ever says ""well, they're MC questions, you should be able to answer them quickly..."" welp, she gives the same length exam to her Hunter kids but they had 1h and 50min, so... 
Structure of the course: WOW, where to begin... wow. SHE HANDS THESE WORKSHOP QUESTIONS, RIGHT? THEN EXPECTS US TO ATTEND HER WORKSHOP ON THE FRIDAY WHEN SHE GAVE OUT THE WORKSHOP ON THE THURSDAY. WOW. WOW. THAT'S NOT THE WORST PART. THERE ARE NO ANSWERS!!!!!! WOW WOW WOW. NOPE, NO ANSWERS. AND THEN DURING WORKSHOP SESSIONS, SHE WOULD KEEP AGREEING TO A STUDENT, AND UNTIL SOMEONE SAYS, ""hey that's wrong..."" ONLY THEN WILL SHE SAY, ""yay, i'm glad you brought that up...""

I expect an A in Anna's lab, so there's my conflict of interest in writing this review. 
A week into the semester when everyone was trying to get into a section they want, I was registered in Anna's class on a Friday and waitlisted in Dani's. Oh my, the effort that went into the begging and whoring that I did to get into Dani's monday lab was unparalleled. I was attedning both Anna's and Dani's lab lectures for two weeks, just so I can try and squeeze myself into Dani's bc lets be honest a lot of people are still saying that Dani > Anna. WELL, NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! LET ME DISPROVE THAT TO YOU. 
I'VE NEVER HAD A BLESSING MORE DISGUISED THAN BEING STUCK IN AG'S LAB LECTURE. 
She gives us so much practice for pre-lab. Like a lot. if you're about to take Orgo Lab I, brace yourself cause the first prelab is ridiculous, like yikes. It was I think 6 questions but 1 and 2 had a-j. lol Anna, why. but when the quiz came? Damn,  I slayed that. It felt so good, and everyone i know in Dani's class were like, damn I couldn't.... blehbleble... 
Then came the times when she'd make jokes in office hours or buy us pizza and baked ziti and talk about her ham sandwich and her swweet, sweet smell. Anna!! She's so helpful during office hours, so even though Dani's prelabs are graded by completion, ours kinda are too... just go to OH. 2 extra hours a week, maybe less... just make sure you come on-time, cause she uses it like lecture and the first 2 hours are like you trying to get answers.... which are cool and better if youve done/tried the prelab... do that and do the problems again and you'll be ready for her quizzes. They're a lot easier than I expected. It's also better than Dani's cause you don't have lab'lecture every week bc u have your lecture and lab on the same week. Dani has it alternating (i.e. one week lab, the other is quiz so you always have ORGO LAB-related classes)
My TA was Lindsey.... not much to say, but she's cool and composed. What I love most about her was that she's so open to letting us do our own thing. She'd let us start an experiment if she knows we already did the demo, and not afraid to just let us make mistakes, which I think in turn, makes me more confident in the lab. 
Anyway, back to Anna.... She also taught me NMR and IR. I went into out IR/NMR bootcamp with no idea about anything. like literally nothing. After 5h, voila. I can read a spectrum as quickly as I read Shakespeare. yay. 
tl;dr... Anna is perfect for those people who are ready to try hard. Don't be like me and don't think that you're ""STUCK"" in AG's lab, bc you ain't. It might just be the best thing that happens to your Chem career  @CU

I skipped lab twice and made it up on a different day, it was so cool and unmessy... like on the first time I did it, she literally said, it's ok, the navy won't come looking for you if you don't attend lab on the right day! and then laughed in her own sweet manner. She's also so passionately proud that we still use and breed the same flies that Thomas Hunt Morgan (yes, THE THOMAS HUNT MORGAN, discoverer of sex-linked genes) and claims that our lab was also THG's lab. So that was so cute. The -0.5 was bc of her subsonic voice. sad.

Pig dissections: 6.5/10 If you've never dissected before, probably lower... but I always just tell myself that I should pretend I know what I'm doing and I should be fine. and I did. I also registered for this class after the first week of labs, so she was really flexible with Office hours and everything like it was so easy to catch up and do 'relatively' well on the practical exam. The practical was hard though. The avergae is usually 140/200. I got a 161 and my TA said I should expect an A. cool. A lot of the parts on the practical tests the views though, so if you're used to seeing the hyoid bone on the buccal area, dorsal or ventral, you might be tested on how it looks like after a saggital cut. The most painful part of the practical is the histology bc she'd give you a slide and ask you whats the pointer pointing at, and then what's 7 oclock of that, 4 oclock and 11 oclock of that... like yo i have 90 seconds in this station pls calm down.
Labs: 4.5/10? Yuck, ew. Pls take it out. Like abs no point in doing them. They're boring and such a drag. Or maybe switch the class like first half should be the labs and the last half is the pig, cause the pig is fun. the labs are weird and annoying and her post lab questions are a DRAG. they're dry, useless and annoying, like WHYYYYYY DO I HAVE TO DO THIS AGAIN!!!! type of thing.

As someone who previously loved math, the fact that I am relieved to not take another calc class tells you all you need to know about Cerbo.
First- Cerbo does not know how to teach. I gave up showing up to class after a month because I honestly got nothing out of it. He is very awkward and does not seem to know what is in reach for the class. Apparently he got better near the end of the semester-- I wouldn't know. All I know is that the class got crazy difficult from the second midterm on. The second midterm was a nightmare, plagued with mistakes only corrected via email from an absent Cerbo in real time. And the final was on a whole other level. My friends from higher levels of calculus were surprised they couldn't do a single one of the problems from my practice final. Although the class was curved, I would still appreciate being taught how to do the questions I'm given. The assigned homework was very deceptive, nearly all of the problems extremely easy compared to the final. I will say, his practice exams are decent indicators of what you need to know for the final. If you do take his class, don't assume he's making them easier than what's on the actual test. 
If you want easy A, do not take Cerbo, even if you've taken AP calculus! If you want to learn and truly understand the material, do not take Cerbo! Just don't take Cerbo lmao.

This class was the worst part of my semester. The material itself was enjoyable, but Professor Singh's instruction was terrible. To start, he would not grade or read our essays until a scheduled 30 minute meeting, usually around a month after we would hand our papers in. I would sit down for our meeting, he would struggle to find my paper, and ask me if I had actually handed it in. Once he found it, he would take 5-10 minutes to read my paper (for the first time) in complete silence, write a grade on the last page, then would not let me look at it until the end of our meeting. He, several times, gave me formatting corrections that directly went against MLA style, which he was adamant I adhere to. He only reads the sections of the books we read in class so he has no context for the passages other than what he can garner from a skim of Sparknotes and what he remembers from high school. Avoid this professor if possible. His instructions are confusing and counterintuitive, his expectations are unclear and constantly wavering, and his teaching is unenthused and uninformed.

Have to write this since my good ol' friend Ton doesn't have a review on here yet. Which is surprising, because everyone has something to say about him. 
TL;DR - in ~4 years of undergrad, this was the worst experience I've had with a professor.
TD thinks he is so much better than he is. I think we heard about him meeting President Obama like 3 times during the semester. Also, he tried to introduce a video lecture-twist to the class which (mostly) everyone hated. Nobody showed up to class after that. But, coincidentally, he ran out of videos and was too lazy to keep making them. So we went back to normal lecture.
Lectures are okay- but listening to a man slouched over a god damn Microsoft Surface is painful at times, especially when he is so full of himself (also just hate his condescending language and smirk). He fosters an overly intense environment in the classroom, especially during his exams (which are absurd). ""Nobody has every gotten a 100 on my exams"" he says (somebody did get a 100 on the second midterm, I hope TD went home and cried that day). But during exams, he made students take off their hats, and went around and literally checked every pencil + eraser + water bottle he could find. I think he has an array of trust issues). I also heard a story about a girl who went to the first midterm sick, and as soon as he passed the exam out she passed out and had to be hospitalized (5 minutes after pencils hit the exam). TD gave her a 0 on the exam because she made the ""conscious decision"" to sit-in on the exam. Well, she did that because TD literally states in the first class that basically nothing will prevent you from taking his exams unless you or some family member dies. That day. Lighten up dude. Have a heart. Understand that we are forced to take this class. Nobody cares (after the first time you tell us) that you met President Obama. 
P.S. Make sure you go to the classes after the class where he says ""the material for the final ends here"" because SURPRISE!!!! it doesn't end there. Yup. In a ""Probability for Engineers"" course, we were taught the invigorating concepts surrounding ASSET PRICING (what is this class called again? I realize it's in IEOR, but who the fuck cares about pricing assets, especially when it's taught after he tells US THAT EVERYTHING IN HIS ALREADY STALE COURSE PRIOR TO THAT CLASS WAS THE FINAL MATERIAL).

Have to write this since my good ol' friend Ton doesn't have a review on here yet. Which is surprising, because everyone has something to say about him. 
TL;DR - in ~4 years of undergrad, this was the worst experience I've had with a professor.
TD thinks he is so much better than he is. I think we heard about him meeting President Obama like 3 times during the semester. Also, he tried to introduce a video lecture-twist to the class which (mostly) everyone hated. Nobody showed up to class after that. But, coincidentally, he ran out of videos and was too lazy to keep making them. So we went back to normal lecture.
Lectures are okay- but listening to a man slouched over a god damn Microsoft Surface is painful at times. He fosters an overly intense environment in the classroom, especially during his exams (which are absurd). ""Nobody has every gotten a 100 on my exams"" he says (somebody did get a 100 on the second midterm). But during exams, he made students take off their hats, and went around and literally checked every pencil + eraser + water bottle he could find. I also heard a story about a girl who went to the first midterm sick, and as soon as he passed the exam out she passed out and had to be hospitalized (5 minutes after pencils hit the exam). TD gave her a 0 on the exam because she made the ""conscious decision"" to sit-in on the exam. Well, she did that because TD literally states in the first class that basically nothing will prevent you from taking his exams unless you or some family member dies. That day. Lighten up dude.
P.S. Make sure you go to the classes after the class where he says ""the material for the final ends here"" because SURPRISE!!!! it doesn't end there. Yup. In a ""Probability for Engineers"" course, we were taught the invigorating concepts surrounding ASSET PRICING (what is this class called again? I realize it's in IEOR, but who the fuck cares about pricing assets, especially when it's taught after he tells US THAT EVERYTHING IN HIS ALREADY STALE COURSE PRIOR TO THAT CLASS WAS THE FINAL MATERIAL).

Lydia's course Philosophy of Art begins with essentialist questions (what is art? what is beauty?) and ends with sociological and political questions (how does art figure in the political realm? how does the institutional art world wield its power to decide on questions of taste? why are there no great women artists?), using selected philosophical texts as markers. The readings are very enjoyable as are Goehr's lectures. 
Sometimes, however, her lectures are winding and discursive, in large part because she takes questions. So this class is part seminar, part lecture. I think Goehr is a very visual and abstract thinker. She often draws large abstracted maps of argument and history. And she is clearly very spiritually invested in art too; this makes sense as she comes from a family of artists, a fact she will make sure you know about her. 
The problem with this course is a lack of direction re writing and argumentation. You will be asked to write on a number of highly open-ended questions--to ""make an argument,"" and yet spend most of your time ""in exposition."" TAs are open and helpful enough. However, it seems like they keep their standards intentionally esoteric which I don't approve of.

I am basically just writing this review to help Vaz get a gold nugget, because all these other reviews are spot on, Vaz is an incredible professor, lecturer, and person, and if you have the opportunity to take a class with him, you should absolutely do it.  
This particular class is incredibly relevant right now and has a fantastic syllabus. I learned a lot I hadn't learned before, and I also have a much better understanding now of things I had some understanding of before, but didn't really think about in an impactful way.  This course addresses issues such as the history of incarceration in America, race in America, immigration, and the treatment of vice in American history and the effect that these methods of treatment have had on modern American history.  Because the material of the course is so interesting, I actually really enjoyed doing the readings and writing the papers.  
Vaz is a phenomenal speaker, he is clearly brilliant, but is able to break down history into a very comfortable and understandable lecture.  He is candid and comfortable, and manages to facilitate real discussion in a ~100 person lecture.  I literally looked forward to going to his class, do yourself a favor and take it.

Ansaf is a strange breed at Columbia. I've never seen a teacher care so much about the academic and personal well-being of her students. Step into office hours and she exudes warmth and happiness.  Her and the TAs were very responsive on Piazza, and also very willing to listen to arguments for grading changes. Lots of partial credit on exams as well. Overall pretty easy class.
However, the actually teaching quality has a high variance. I think she does a fine job of explaining stuff, but she goes extremely slowly and there is almost 0 value to actually showing up to class, when you can just skim the entire week's powerpoints in 20 minutes and have caught up on the material. 
Overall, I would definitely recommend this section. However, if you want a rigorous understanding of Discrete, and also to be challenged in class, I would look elsewhere. Jessica Ouyang taught a concurrent section the semester I took the class, but she was less popular simply because she offered those things and people (including myself) were too lazy and just wanted to get out of a requirement.

Professor Ortoleva is a fantastic professor, and I highly recommend him if he’s available to take for microeconomics. He’s such a great lecturer and he’ll break down a topic until he’s sure that everyone understands it. The first three homeworks were fairly straightforward, but the last two were a little harder. Though, I thank him for assigning them as they prepare you very well for the final. He’s also a super nice guy and very understanding, so I highly recommend going to his office hours if you need extra help. His TAs were also really great. Very highly recommended!!

** Had him for Fall 2016. Econ major but not a fan of math. ** 
He is not the best lecturer. He definitely seemed very interested in development, which is cool, but we end up going really slowly for the first half of the semester, which makes him cram the rest in the second half. My main complaint with Xavier is how unorganized he is. His syllabus is very minimal--it lists topics that are going to be covered without any indication of the timeline (probably because he himself doesn't know what the timeline is going to look like) and grade distribution. Anyways, studying for his cumulative final was a MESS. His ""textbook"" is essentially long word documents and pdf's that have a lot of typos. They didn't help much with my studying. The final was kind of a disaster overall // a lot of people came out of it dumbfounded (including myself). BUT the curve was very very good. So there's that. Also, rumor has it that Xavier didn't like our class because of an annoying group of people that always sat in the front of class and asked annoying questions. In summary, he's not someone I would recommend, but is also not someone I would strongly speak against. One thing for sure is that he's not worth all the hype.

Xavier is the BEST Econ professor I have had so far!!!!!!! Whereas my Micro professor was all about mathematics and proofs and trick questions, Xavier was all about FUN and learning. He explained concepts so well that I could always recall what exactly he said about specific concepts. He uses metaphors (""cookies"" as real GDP), animated examples, and his quirky humor. At times, I felt this guy could even teach kindergarteners macroeconomics. The problem sets were usually well written as well. You get a few easy questions and the rest require slight tweaks to the models. The lecture was extremely entertaining as you saw from his famous words about children. But the one I loved the most was the Columbia students as a wicked example of the ""borrower"" lol. Also, as a non-conventional Growth Economics, Xavier taught us both the classical and Keynesian views. What a good deal for me. At the end of the day, I have learned so much with MINIMUMAL STRESS thanks to a great teacher like this.
Although the class size was overwhelmingly large and occasionally someone would ask questions that I would rather ask in the recitations, I appreciated this equal opportunity for 400 people to enjoy such a good class. The Econ department should also do the same thing with CORPORATE FINANCE: provide more opportunities for non-Financial-Econ majors to explore this area and recognize that registration priority is BS, bureaucratic, and anti-intellectual.
My ONLY complaint to the class was the fact that the TAs, who made the final, failed to proofread questions and left us with SIX mistakes. COME ON guys. We had 10 TAs and none of them paid enough attention to proofreading.

Professor McWhorter is one of the best lecturer I have encountered at Columbia. A lot of animated examples. A lot of story-telling. He also opened up the class to Q&A and discussion. Before the midterm, the class followed the textbook more closely whereas after the midterm you really had to pay more attention to what he said in class. At times, John was an awesome tour guide for newcomers to this field and he opened up my mind to a life-long adventure of languages and linguistics. He also recommended a lot of other important linguists and books and I appreciate this. I will give a Gold Nugget for professor McWhorter!
The TAs are very helpful as well. They are very chill and approachable. Alma explains concepts really well. The TA office hour is a great opportunity to interact with classmates as well. I have found many classmates in this class are somewhat more brainy and witty than those in my Econ core classes and this really humbles me. In conclusion, I enjoyed the class, the TA office hours and the company of my witty classmates.

Lecture-based class with a discussion section, which for the most part reviews the problem set and occasionally review what was discussed in the lecture.
His lectures are okay, not stellar nor terrible. He knows what he is talking about, and you can learn most of the information from just reading the textbook. The only thing he changes are the examples he uses, i.e. Joe's Coffee. 
The first half of the class is dedicated to Micro, the latter to Macro. Macro definitely the most challenging of the two.

Probably the quirkiest professor I've had. Most of what he teaches is copied off the textbook. He follows the examples from the textbook, so if you ever doubting or wondering what the hell is going on, just reference the textbook for his examples.
Covers Calc II, integrals, methods of integration, polar and parametric, and Series and Sequences.
His Russian accent is not as think as people say it is. He's a genuinely nice guy who doesn't always answer student's questions, but nonetheless, a pretty decent professor. He does crack jokes and most of the time students don't get it.
Apparently, he doesn't teach Calc II much, he usually does Calc I and III.

One of the most well taught and interesting courses I took so far. If you thought the P and NP stuff in CS theory was at all interesting, this class will blow your mind with all the different notions of complexity there are.
That said be warned that it's really more of a math course: It's more rigorous and definitely more abstract than the algorithms course. Despite this, Professor Chen makes this manageable by giving motivation before going into long proofs and explaining steps along the way and why they are important in the big picture. Sometimes he will even give a ""toy"" version of the proof first, which mimics the idea but has a few technical holes, and then go back and fix them after, which I thought was nice. He's also very receptive to questions and can answer them well without coming off as condescending. 
The bad part was the class was from 7:10-8:25p, but the lectures were recorded so you could always watch those if you missed out. There was also tons of written resources (we had essentially 4 textbooks, not to mention all the other stuff you could find online) so you can definitely self teach if that's more your style.

This was the single worst class I have ever taken at Columbia. Maybe it was because he just came back from a break from teaching, and maybe he was rusty. But this class assumes you already have a solid foundation in chemistry before you even step foot in the class. Things start out simple but then skyrocket and all of a sudden you're sitting in a quantum physics lecture with no idea of what is going on. Piazza is very active, which can be both a blessing and a curse. There's valuable questions there, some of which he uses for quizzes. However there is so many questions it is nearly impossible to sift through it all. Additionally, there are times where what he is saying verbally contradict what is on the lecture slides or in the textbook. This creates confusion that carries over into exams

This is a fantastic psych course, and I strongly recommend taking it whether you're a first-year trying out psych or a senior in search of a straightforward but engaging lecture to fill your requirements. 
Professor Tottenham is amazing at explaining every concept, kind, helpful, funny, and always interesting to listen to - even if she's just going through a theory or experiment. And since she specialized in the amygdala, she also uses recent, innovative studies on the amygdala and psychopathology to supplement the more generic developmental psych stuff, which makes the course more interesting and less repetitive for anyone who has taken related courses. 
Show up to class because the powerpoints (which are useful and posted for every lecture) are supplemented with a lot of info, including videos.  I would not recommend buying the textbook since it is barely used and only lecture material seems to be on the exams. If you want lots of background info on developmental psych, check the current or earlier edition out at the library. Really no need for buying anything. Definitely at least skim the assigned papers/studies though because they do come up and are pretty interesting and helpful for illustrating concepts.

I have mixed feelings about this class. There were some things that I really liked about Prof. Archibong, and some things that I think could have been done differently. The class is very theoretical and I only took it because it was required for the major. I honestly didn't enjoy the class very much, but I will say, I did learn a lot and (unexpectedly) ended up doing really well in the course. 
Pros: 
- she posts PPT slides of the lecture and you're only responsible for the materials that are on the slides 
- very responsive to e-mail, always willing to help and will answer to questions your have
- extra credit by posting on discussion board / recitation quiz 
- debate is pretty chill, I think everyone did very well - better than have 3 papers like other professors
- final exam was very fair, no surprises 
- she wants to make the class fun for everyone, she had us fill out mid-semester evaluations to get suggestions on how she could improve the class
- essay graded base on content so if you're not a stong writer you can still do well 
Cons: 
- the PPT are sometimes useless because the bullter points are vague and don't make any sense
- essays are graded harshly, they're more like extended long answer to a question, she wants to you mention specific terms to get high marks, not really open to your own interpretation
- very slow grading, took maybe a month or more before we got our essay back, also some essays were graded by the prof and others were graded by the TA, which I don't think is fair at all
- she never mangage to finish the lecture on time and doesn't cover all the material she wants to so things get push back more and more as the semester goes on 
- often started class late (although this could also be a pro)
Not related to Prof. Archibong, but, the TA was HORRIBLE!!! She didn't seem like she know what she was doing, reciation was pretty much a waste of time and she often cancelled them / switch around the time of the reciations. She also does not follow her own syllabus and dates she had set for the quizzes, so this could mess up your schedule if you have week with lots of exams and she decided to issue a quiz that week. Also, I think there needs to be better communication between the Prof. and TA.

This class was by far one of my favorite classes the past semester. 
I've heard some horrible stories about teachers catapulting information at their students and not caring if their students understand the topic. Prof. Mukherjee is not one of those teachers. 
Granted, her derivations can be unclear, and some homework assignments were difficult, but since there is a physics help room, office hours lead by the TA, AND office hours lead by her, your questions will always be answered. 
On top of that, her grading system works in your favor. She drops your two lowest grades, and curves the final. And if your final is a better grade than your quizzes/midterms, she'll replace your final grade with your quiz grade. Tldr; you're going to get the best grade possible. 
Class time is typically spent with the first bit being lecture, and the second bit being problems worked on the board, and sometimes amongst groups you're sitting next to. 
As long as you put in effort and seek out help when you need it, you'll be fine.

TLDR: Take him if you want to have a good mathematical intuition of stats and like challenges. If you hate math and thinking, then take the others. 
The Good:
Professor Cunningham is the best professor to have if you're genuinely interested in Statistics. He makes sure that the class understands the mathematical intuition behind concepts like linear regression and hypothesis tests. He's extremely good at answering questions. I once asked a completely nonsensical question in class and his answer somehow made complete sense. His jokes are as dry as the subject material, but they're still funny. He's also always willing to talk with students. Stay after class and sometimes you can ask him about his time in Wall Street or general career advice that's very helpful. It's very obvious he cares about teaching and he goes out of his way to make very good practice finals and study guides. I've also heard that he's pretty good looking; so that's an added plus if that helps you pay attention during lecture.
The midterms and finals are a set of easy questions (reworded versions of problems explained in class) followed by a question that nearly no one gets and requires you to extrapolate from concepts in lecture. 
Finally, there's a great curve. So even if the class is kind of hard, the class will still inflate your gpa. 
The Bad:
The homework is really random and obnoxiously tedious. Zero tolerance for late work. Also homework had to be uploaded to courseworks which was a bother. 
You have no idea what your grade is throughout the course.

Workload:
20% - Weekly Homework - 2-3 hours a week, lowest two grades dropped. 
40% - Midterm - 2 easy questions 1 hard - average 55%
40% - Final - 3 easy questions 1 hard 
Very Generous Curve. One standard deviation above the average is an A+.

Christia is absolutely amazing. Besides possessing a wealth of knowledge in different areas of philosophy, she's one of those professors that truly cares about her students and will encourage them every step of the way. She's not afraid to voice her opinions in lecture, especially about politics (as some have already stated). This may bother some students, but I found her openness very refreshing and endearing. She's very clear about who she is and what she stands for, which goes a long way in making her more approachable as a person and mentor.
Philosophy and Feminism provided a good introduction to philosophy, as well as the changing attitudes about sex and gender throughout history. She said on the first class that the course was Philosophy AND Feminism, not Philosophy OF Feminism or Feminism IN Philosophy. She definitely stuck with this idea, as the course began with philosophical ideas (think Plato) and eventually turned more sociological near the end (like discussing the Prison Industrial Complex or Anita Hill case). The class was definitely geared towards more introductory students, as all of the papers had very clear and direct prompts and the class consisted of a midterm and final with passage IDs (which usually doesn't happen in upper-level philosophy courses). 
That being said, I'd definitely recommend the class to other philosophy majors (as well as other students), as Christia covered a lot of very complicated texts (like Judith Butler's Gender Trouble or Foucault's History of Sexuality), albeit at a very introductory and approachable level for the rest of the class. Regardless, the choices in her syllabus are definitely worth reading, and if you're interested delving further, go to office hours to meet with Christia about them. Also I don't think I would have been introduced to such a sheer diversity of topics in another philosophy course (epistemic justice, objectivity in science, discourse-power, feminist epistemology, prison industrial complex, Augustine's impact on feminism, performative gender, etc etc). Christia does a very great job of weaving these ideas together.
Christia definitely wanted all of her students to succeed and actually take away something from the course. I'm not sure about the exact grading distribution, but I think it's very likely that if you put in effort and genuinely think about these texts and ideas (as you should be doing anyway), you'll do well in this course -- and hopefully leave having become a more aware person.
Also if you're given the chance, take a seminar with her too! She's great in lecture, but she is even better in smaller more intimate setting (as are most professors). 
As a last note, Christia shares this Foucault quote a lot in class, where Foucault says his philosophy is like a toolbox and he ""writes for users, not readers."" This is definitely the focus of Christia's class and she leaves all her students very well-prepared to apply the knowledge gained from this class to various different fields and aspects of life.
Also shoutout to TA Conor Cullen! He's great, helpful, kind, and made himself readily available to his students!

Alma Mora is the sweetest lady, and I definitely recommend her as a professor. I do agree that most of the time I have no idea what she is saying or what's going on, but I think that's how it is in the Spanish department in general. It's the teaching method. Professor Mora barely gives any homework, and I find it to be an incredibly light load. You can skimp if you want; a lot of stuff is not graded, she just wants you to look over the material that will be covered in the next class. Professor Mora is also an easy grader; I was able to put in minimal effort and get A's. If you put in an effort to make is seem like you really care and really want to do well, Professor Mora is very receptive to that. Go to office hours a few times. Participate in class. Ask questions. It's easy.
As for the classes themselves, very little material was covered, and they are quite easy compared to part II of each.

I really enjoyed this class.  While I agree with other reviewers that Kelemen's lectures can sometimes be boring because they really are mostly just graphs that don't mean much when you're presented with them in such rapid sequence, I think that Kelemen tries (and often succeeds) to be an engaging professor.  He's witty and sharp and tends to break up the monotony of the data- and memorization-driven slides with interesting stories about his past and ramblings about kayaking, politics, and Willie Nelson (lol).  He also tries to present all of the information in the context of a larger story, which helps.  I completely disagree that he expects prior knowledge of geological concepts (or really of anything).  I think that in order to completely and fully understand everything he discusses, this may be necessary, but to follow along, you don't need to know anything (this is coming from someone who knows nothing lol).
This class was the first one I took in the Sustainable Development major and I actually think it did a decent job of presenting me with the basic issues in the environmental science/earth science fields.  Because of the requirement of two term papers OR one term paper and one presentation, you also get to know a couple of topics (you can literally choose anything) fairly in-depth, which I liked a lot.  If you're looking to learn a lot of in-depth stuff about climate change, renewable energy, etc., this probably isn't the class you want to take.  But if you want a general overview of resources available across the globe and the basic background of some of the most important issues in sustainability, go ahead and take this class.  Kelemen is a smart guy who cares about what he teaches and who's done some really cool work with carbon capture and sequestration, which was really interesting to learn about.
Also, it's pretty easy.  The term papers can take a lot of time if (like me) you're not used to writing research papers, but other than that I literally didn't do any work or reading outside of class (except for some studying for exams).  I think it would make a pretty good class to fulfill the science requirement because of this.  I opted for doing two term papers rather than a discussion section so I can't say how those are.  As long as you pay attention during lectures and put a moderate amount of work into studying and your papers/presentation, you can probably expect to get above a B+.

Organic Chem Lab was difficult for me. However, if I didn't fully understand something in lecture, Dani and the TAs were helpful at explaining the concepts in their office hours. The quizzes were hard, and I did below average on the majority of them (and the averages were pretty low in general), but there are plenty of ways to gain points elsewhere, such as labs, lab reports, lab technique etc. 
The content of both lab sections were pretty much the same, as I had some friends who were enrolled in the other instructor's section as well. Dani is a lighthearted person who cares about her students and genuinely encourages them to learn and think for themselves. She also tries to engage the students in her lecture, which is hard considering the class is 100+ people. If you're a person who likes this kind of teaching, I would take lab lecture with Dani. 
I believe the class was graded on a curve. Even though I did below average on the quizzes (which I studied a lot for), I managed to get an A in the class. I would not worry too much if your quiz grades are really bad. As long as you put in a decent effort in your reports and prepare for your labs, the TAs were pretty lenient with the grading. The one thing I recommend is to go to office hours if you don't understand something. Dani and the TAs were all really approachable and really good at explaining concepts.

Read the other reviews. Sev (he's not one for formality) is a phenomenal professor and engaging lecturer who has changed the way I see human history. (Sounds dramatic, but take the class, pay attention, and it won't sound so crazy.) I'm not gonna spend my time going into this, because I mostly want to talk about the workload. There was a LOT of it, but not all was necessary. The key to doing well is actually paying attention in lecture and taking good notes (big surprise there). Since he goes over everything important in class, and the stuff he talks about for a long time is generally what's on the exams, it feels pretty straightforward. 
Feels like a lot for an intro, but if you don't do all the reading, the bulk of the work is in the end when you need to write a total of between 4500-5500 words in the last couple weeks. Definitely doable, and it was way too interesting for me to mind that much. Take this class.

Given the last review for Professor Nieh was written in 2013, I figured it is worth to share some more thoughts on this class.
This class is everything they say it is. Nieh will teach you everything you need to know about Operating Systems, and then some more. His lectures are fast-paced, dense and sometimes difficult to keep track of. However, he is a very good lecturer with an impressive command over the material. He will answer several questions during class, which sometimes gets frustrating as he digresses. If you pay attention, you will learn a lot, but you will often have to back up the concepts with the textbook to actually master the material.
And then there are the homeworks. Oh God. Nieh will talk about the concepts in class and he will talk about the homeworks a little bit, but to be honest, you are all alone. They involve writing code into the Linux kernel. Not only do you have to read A LOT (I mean, A LOT) of C code to figure out what you need to do, you also have to be really good at C to actually implement what's expected of you in a reasonable amount of time. Expected to spend 10 hours figuring out what you actually need to do before you write a single line of code. Expect to actually skip homework on other classes to finish these assignments. They will make you a great coder (especially if you want to be a systems programmer), and you will actually master reading Linux source code by the end, but it's a ridiculously rough patch. You will also have to demo your completed homework to a TA after it is done.
Here are the breakdown of each of the programming assignments:
   - Writing a bash shell. This one is the only individual programming assignment and also the only one not involving kernel programming. It is probably the easiest to do, but it'll still take around ~10 hours to finish. I see this more as a weed-out assignment for the students who aren't as confident in C.
   - Writing a system call to keep track of Android's interprocess communications. This is the first time you will write code for the Linux kernel and also the first time you will write a system call. It's not actually that difficult, but takes a lot to get used to the programming environment.
   - Writing an interface that sleeps selected Android processes and makes them wait on designated light intensity levels. The main emphasis here is concurrency / synchronisation. Starting from this assignment, you will actually be using a physical Android device, which Nieh makes you buy. Expect to pay a total of $200 as a group of three. 
   - Writing a process scheduler for Linux. This is easily the most difficult assignment in the class. Most of the teams actually didn't do it and dropped the assignment. My team spent over 30 hours and still got a failing grade. I'd still recommend you to attempt it, since you may be tested on the homework.
   - Exposing process memory to the user. This is the assignment that has to do with memory and paging in Linux. Conceptually can be a pain to figure out, but it's not actually a lot of lines of code. There are some weird Linux-related bugs which slowed us down, so expect to find hacky ways around them.
   - Writing a file system for Linux. This wasn't that bad because the TA's set the homework up pretty well, but just like all the other homeworks, it's again a lot of time.
Don't expect the grading to be nice because the homeworks are hard. We were constantly tested on weird edge cases that we didn't think of. Nieh expects the highest of you despite how difficult it is to even set up the groundwork for a lot of these assignments.
TA's: Some are very good and some are very bad. Don't expect office hours to be helpful, they are overcrowded and if there are students scheduled to demo their homeworks, you won't get to even ask questions.
Textbooks: There are two. One is very helpful for programming for the Linux kernel, especially early on. The other is helpful for the written components of the homeworks and for studying for the midterm and the final. If you could get one, get the Linux programming one.
Both of the tests are also difficult, with class averages around 50-60 percentiles. You may be asked on anything you did for this class, from the lectures to the homeworks.
Finally, grading is OK with a mean around B+, but you leave feeling it could be more generous given how much work and patience this class expects of you to even get a score around the mean. Despite all of that, if you do your work, you will learn an incredible amount about operating systems, C, Linux, systems programming, concurrency, and even more.
Workload:
(50% ) 6 homework assignments. There's a group component, which focuses on programming for the Linux kernel, each of which takes easily more than 20 hours of your time to finish (and often more). There's also an individual written component, which actually takes a maximum of 2 hours to finish.
(20%) Midterm. Included writing out programs and short answer questions. Doable but not easy.
(30%) Final, included programming, true or false questions and short answers. Final this semester was ridiculously difficult.

I feel like I should warn students about this professor. She seemed really cool on the first day of class and she advertised herself as being this incredible professor who made students fall in love with organic, but in reality, she is none of those things. She picks favorites, she does not curve her exams even though the average for all three of our exams was a C or C-, she did not tell us about her grading scale until after the second exam, basically after it was too late to drop her course, and if you don't go to her workshops, it's basically impossible to do well in her class. Some students thought her lecture was interesting, but I thought her drawings on the board were very disorganized and found it difficult to read my notes later. She doesn't use the textbook at all really so everything is from class notes, but again, if those are bad, you cannot do well.

Gil was passionate and the course material was interesting. Gil did a really incredible job of opening the lecture up to discussion in a room with 100+ students. I would definitely suggest taking the class. My only complaint was that his lecture slides seemed seriously disorganized to me. Some of his slides were just massive blocks of text and quotes. Other slides were just a couple words and some random stock images that didn't seem to have any meaning. It was kind of funny, but also annoying when trying to go back and study from them.

I came into Columbia feeling pretty confident that I was a good writer. Catherine reminded me that I still have A LOT to work on. Even though we only wrote three essays, the class felt quite difficult. She really pushed us to improve our writing. She gave us extensive feedback on ungraded rough drafts, which was nice. On every essay I wrote, I found myself completely starting over once I had her comments on my rough draft. Overall, I think Catherine was a really great teacher. She's kind, funny, and understanding.

I've had one semester of CC with him and he is up and away the best instructor I've had at columbia (granted that's only been a year and a half at this point). Infectiously nice and actually made me want to go to class, and read the material, but you can totally get by in the class without doing so. Specifically wants you to understand the discussion in class on tests (midterm/final) more than random quotations from the reading. Makes sure everyone gets a chance to participate and really wants you to be interested in the material. He may look like a little bit of a straight-edge kinda guy, but he's really willing to work with you if you can't make a deadline/have any sort of issue in the class.

I really enjoyed this class. I had some programming experience in high school, which was very helpful, but there are lots of people who don’t have experience and still do well. If you are interested in the subject and willing to work hard, this class is very doable. Cannon wants you to succeed and so do all the TAs. There are tons of office hours, which you should go to right away if you are confused, especially at the beginning of the semester because computer science builds on itself. My advice is to start the projects early (seriously, look at the prompt before class and then try to do half of it by the next class and then finish before the deadline) and get help often. You might want to look at some online coding courses before hand, but it isn’t necessary. Many people take this class having never looked at code before in their life and are fine, but it is definitely harder because coding is a new way of thinking that might not work for you. Also, it is important to go to class because there were several questions on the final that are based on programs we went over in class but weren’t explained in the textbook.

This class was okay. Brian doesn’t really teach the grammar rules, which is a pretty big focus of this class, so you have to learn them from the workbook, which isn’t the most helpful book. He also assigns an excessive number of exercises from the workbook that don’t really help you learn/understand the rules because you just have to copy the model with different verbs, pronouns, etc. He is also very disorganized and always late, which is why we were very behind at the end of the semester and had to rush/do lots of work in a short amount of time. The tests are similar to the practice tests expect they are longer and have a writing section. His grading, especially on written work, seems to reflect how much he likes you/his mood when he is grading. There is no clear explanation of why you get one grade on one thing and a completely different grade on another, which is very unhelpful and irritating. The final didn’t have a writing or a listening section, which was really nice. If you have to take this class, you will probably be fine, but, if you have a choice, maybe pick a different professor because Brian doesn’t really teach and assigns too much (busy) work. Also, he talks in English a lot.

I think this was a good class. Teng doesn’t really know how to teach, but he wants students to do well. He has difficulty understanding what most people can do with math and tends to explain things in a way that is overly complex. This inability to understand what most students can do causes him to write tests with functions that are way to complicated and messy. This makes his tests hard and frustrating, way more so than the homework. However, he actually wants his students to do well so, if you advocate for yourself and speak out when you think something is unreasonable for this classes level, he will rethink what he is doing (maybe not right away in front of the class, but he will probably change his approach by the next class). It also seems like he wants to learn how to teach so that he can help you do better. Overall, he is nice and wants you to do well, but he doesn’t fully understand how to make the information always accessible to everyone and the tests are hard because of the calculations they involve, which makes them the most stressful part of this class.

This class was relatively easy. Just as FYI the class is all about voter behavior and polling, not American politics generally. Not all of the reading was necessary with much of the important stuff coming from Erikson's text book. All of the exam questions will basically come from the powerpoints in class. Nothing super exciting about the class, but I did love Professor Erikson. He's very sweet and talks about the material in understandable terms. Taking this class during the 2016 election was also super interesting and I liked that Professor Erikson incorporated daily news into our study of polling data. Also he brought NATE SILVER to talk to us one day so that rocked. Overall an easy class, a little dry at times, but worth taking.

This seminar class was one of the first upper level classes I took in the Columbia political science department and really helped me develop my research skills. I initially felt overwhelmed since the weekly reading is a lot and often incorporates advanced statistics, but Professor Hirano was sooooo helpful. When I expressed my confusion about some material over email he created easy charts to present the information to me and the rest of the class the next day.  I had never done an original research project of my own and the object of the class was to create one. The class was small, only 12 people, and each week one of us was in charge of deciphering and presenting the readings. The main goal, however, was the end 25-30 page research paper. We'd each meet with him one-on-one to discuss our projects and the end product was something I was really proud of. Professor Hirano helped me at each part of the project from brainstorming what topic was feasible to research and incorporated my interests to editing my final draft. The class was awesome because I developed a greater understanding of how to do proper research, how to think critically about the research we read and evaluate problems within it, and how to develop a project that could be published and/or turned into a thesis. Professor Hirano can come across as a little awkward on first meeting, but he is so helpful and really wants his students to learn and succeed. He clearly enjoys teaching and it shows.

Amanda Gannaway is AMAZING. I loved her class so much, she really made Art Humanities interesting for everyone. The exams were easy if you paid attention in class and the papers were always manageable. I loved that she incorporated other artists not in the official curriculum when talking about certain art movements so as to include famous women artists and to point out cultural appropriation. (Every single artist we officially study is male.)  I cannot express how much I love her, everyone should take her class. She has inspired me to take other classes that focus on art during my time at Columbia as well. She makes the material both interesting and easy and facilitates student discussion flawlessly. I give her an A+!

Pre-requisites: The class assumes an understanding of fundamental biology concepts so its best to have taken Intro Bio. That being said, it is not necessary to review any old material before hand. 
Course Overview: The course is an overview of the circle of life. It begin with an overview of development: Fate Determination, Stem Cells, Imprinting, and Artificial Programming/Reprograming. It then moves on to discuss the Development of gametes, fertilization, gastrulation, sex determination, and development of key organs such as the heart. Throughout the course, their will be 5 article discussions that relate to the material at hand.
Class (Professor Heicklen): Professor Heicklen's uses powerpoint slides to present the material with cool video illustrations when appropriate. Unlike other professors which sometimes cram to cover all the material on the slides for a given lecture, Prof. H. goes at a reasonable pace and any material not covered is carried over to the following lecture. She really enjoys interactive lectures and will frequently pose questions, make tables on the board and ask the class to help her fill it out, and also draws diagrams on the board that correspond with a handout so you can fill in the blanks as she draws them. Overall I found her lectures to be effective at presenting the material and her passion for the material keeps you engaged. Furthermore, while at times I found myself getting behind in the material due to other classes, this class was fairly easy to catch up on later on (assuming you attend lectures). I would recommend her to receive a silver nugget on culpa.  
Article Review Sessions: As mentioned before, their are 5 articles with associated HW questions and discussions. While the in class group discussions weren't to hard (and because the majority of the grade is participating), it never felt like to much work. The article HW questions sometimes were confusing, however, I found that attending the article review sessions were very helpful in clarifying any questions, getting hints, and being prepared for the class discussion so I recommend people attend them. 
Study Problems: The non-graded problem sets were very helpful in determining how the material may be tested and helped to elucidate important key points from lectures. Many people either added points to their pre-existing reviews using material from the problem sets or annotated the problem set answer key. Either way, it is very important to have worked through (or at least look through) the problem sets as they are reminiscent of exam questions.
Overall Recommendation: Definitely take this class to fulfill any Bio/Biochem requirement or for fun if you have an interest in the subject matter. You learn a lot, Professor Heicklen is fun, clear, and fair, and the workload is very reasonable.

DenTen, as he is colloquially known, is quite the character. One of the main features of this class is that there are no essays, no graded assignments outside of the midterm and final, and attendance is not mandatory. This makes the class a very interesting mix of people who never show up and never participate, and people who always show up and always participate. This makes the class frequently half-empty, but the discussion can sometimes be interesting.
The only assignment for this course is a weekly Piazza post, or a comment/response to a classmate's Piazza post. If you miss class, you have to complete an additional Piazza post. These posts were graded for completion, and could really include any ideas you had about the text. DenTen does this to encourage us to actually read the texts. He also significantly cut the amount of reading for the semester and substituted with texts that he enjoyed from the CC reader. This made the workload very manageable, and this becomes a fairly simple class as long as you complete most of the readings.
Overall, most of the class received an A-range grade, as long as they completed the mandatory assignments and did fairly well on the midterm/final(mid -80's range). Would recommend.

Xavier's class was a dud to me. Even though it wasn't particularly difficult, I found that I left the class with no new knowledge or expertise about Macroeconomics. The midterm is fairly simple as long as you do the practice tests, the final is quite a bit harder overall, but not too hard. The best tactic for this class is to complete the practice tests before the midterm/final a few times so you can memorize the concepts, and to attend class the second half of the semester. The first half Xavier goes very slowly, and it is not a challenge at all, the second half compensates by going very quickly, so go to class and try to grasp the concepts for the second half/ in preparation for the final. If you do this- you will do well in the class.

Pre-Requisites: A basic understanding of Biology is assumed so make sure you have taken Intro Bio.
Course Overview: The course begins by discussing the Adaptive Immune System. You learn how B and T cells develop, obtain their specificity, their activation, and how they target immunogenic organisms, cells, and substances. The course then moves on to discuss the Innate Immune System. Here you learn about the body's innate defenses and sentinel cells which are the first to respond. How they develop, what receptors they use, and the interconnectedness between the innate and adaptive immune systems (which aren't so distinct). Classical experiments, experimental techniques, and some key diseases are discussed throughout the course. 
Lecture (Professor Mowshowitz): XY Mowsh really loves immunology, and you will too after the course! Throughout the lectures, Professor M. would discuss any relevant diseases associated with a cell/receptor/protein not functioning properly which gave you some real world implications about their importance. In addition, he would discuss the current state of the field and recent developments. The downside to all this fascinating material is that their is so much of it. The lectures at times felt sporadic, jumping from point to point, making it hard to take notes as you are unsure if it is a side comment or important information. Unfortunately, Professor M. prioritized getting through all the material on his slides as opposed to making clear certain concepts presented, resulting in very dense lectures. This is a class where I felt it was a necessity to re-listen to all the audio lectures even when I attended all the lectures. With that said, I do believe I got a lot out of the course as a whole, my note taking and studying skills improved, and I don't regret taking it. He thankfully does not necessarily test any obscure things mentioned and you could always earn partial points on exam questions. 
Lecture (Professor Schindler): Oh, the horror! Dr. Schindler teaches most of the innate Immune system and micriobiome which is about 5 lectures. Although at first I appreciated his inclusion of bullet points in the powerpoint slides, it was even more overwhelming then XY Mowsh lectures because he includes so many diagrams in the slides which were all very complicated and not discussed in detail. This made it much harder than XY Mowsh lectures to discern what was testable and what was just cool stuff he wanted us to know. The greatest problem, however, was the disconnect between the two professors as XY Mowsh would frequently ask ""Did Christian teach you about...?, ""No?!"", ""Brother"" in subsequent lectures. Thankfully, XY Mowsh was understandable about how confusing Dr. Schindlers lectures could be and would accept alternative answers on his exam questions that made sense. 
Overall: With all that said, I do believe this class is worth taking in the end (although perhaps not during a heavy semester). The material is cool enough to make you look past the courses flaws and Professor Mowshowitz does a great job of keeping you engaged with his humor and fun anecdotes. He generously curved each exam to an average of 82, lets you drop your lowest exam grade, and the A cutoff was dropped to about a 260/300 (though it might have been lowered more after the final).

I would not call this class a success. Neumann had trouble proving any non-trivial theorem successfully; he almost always failed to finish the proofs, and had to revise them later or refer us to the book. This is very disappointing, as the whole point of a math lecture is to prove theorems. At times, he attempted to present topics that are not standard to an intro topology class, for example, CW complexes, the classification of 2-surfaces, and ultrafilters. These lectures were interesting, but felt out of sequence; I was not prepared enough to get much out of them. By the time we got to algebraic topology, lecture was spent on excessive examples of graphs, their covers, and their fundamental groups. This was not very conducive to learning the material as he did not effectively connect the examples to the relevant theorems.

This was an interesting class that treated logic from a mathematical perspective. In that this was a math class, I appreciated the formality and precision with which Lando presented proofs. Each proof was done rigorously and convincingly, perhaps sometimes to a fault. Overall, the class was very understandable and appropriately detailed.
The material itself followed the first half of Enderton exactly. We covered set theory and notation, recursive definitions and inductive proofs, sentential logic, and first order logic. Most of the results were fairly straightforward, easy to prove, but interesting insofar as their interpretation. The last few classes were used to prove completeness and compactness of a deductive system, which is a non-trivial result with a lot of interesting implications. This was certainly the most exciting part of the class.

The first half of this course focused on the language of general relativity: index notation for vectors and tensors, metrics, covarient derivatives, geodesics, and definitions of the relevant tensors. This was not hard, but it was very computational. However, it was certainly worth while, as it prepared us for the presentation of black holes, gravitational waves, and cosmology in the second half of the course. This mix of very quantitative computations and fairly qualitative discussion of phenomenon made this a very exciting course; we learned just enough math to make the physics truly understandable.

She's an okay professor. Her lectures are pretty clear, and her examples really do help clarify concepts. The trouble comes when you attempt to speak with her outside of class. She is very unapproachable and at times straight up hurtful. One time I saw a girl leave her office crying uncontrollably. My roommate even considered speaking to the administration about withdrawing from her class after emotional torment over e-mail. The bottom line is that she gets the job done and will teach you psychology, and she is clearly passionate about what she does. BUT BEWARE. This comes at a cost. You would think Barnard/Columbia would want professors to inspire their students and break them down to build them up...not break them down for the sake of breaking them down.

I  found this course pretty manageable even though I did have two stem classes: calc III and physics I at the same time. It is probably recommended that you have some interest in psychology focusing on dreams of course, to get you through the class as some of the readings are very very long and dry. I will say though, that there are a few hidden gems in the assigned readings that really inspired me and had me researching topics we discussed in class on my own time. My impression of the class's general attitude by the end was that there were a few people who thought the professor had favorites and felt they were being viewed negatively, while another few kids got positive attention in class and were encouraged to speak up more. That was one thing that seemed odd to me. Anyways, I got a lot out of this course and it truly built up my confidence in sharing my own ideas, as there are few wrong ""ideas"" you can share in this class. It rarely felt like just a writing class. It felt like an exploration of one's own philosophy and the ""what is life"" question was brought up many times.

I am deeply baffled by the claims that Professor Kesler ""doesn't care at all about her students"" and ""assumes that everyone knows her overly excessive complicated vocabulary."" She is both a passionate sociologist and that rare, rare species among professors, an actual teacher. I loved her and this class.
Prof. Kesler lectures clearly and systematically, listens to and then actually answers questions, and works heartbreakingly hard to help everyone understand the material. If her class was ever boring, it was because she made people feel comfortable asking stupid questions, which she answered with impeccable patience. This was my first sociology class, and I didn't have any trouble keeping up. Also (despite being a quantitative researcher who does data analysis in depth), she explained the statistics concepts we used so that they were accessible to someone who has never taken stats.
We learned a little bit of R (statististical software) for data analysis, which I found super empowering. The Empirical Reasoning Center is your friend--go get help, don't spend hours trying to find a programming glitch and getting nowhere!
I took this class as an Urban Studies senior to inform my thesis and was able to double-use some of the projects for my thesis research.

Anyone who has ever taken this course will tell you how insane it really is. They'll tell how much work it is, how it takes away every last shred of sanity left in your life and mocks you with how much more work you still need to do. They'll tell you how you must be prepared to spend all your days and all your nights at the lab. But that's all just lies. It's worse. 
Navigating through the lectures -
The course starts off right from the very first lecture. The first thing you realize in class is one, that Shepard is a veritable rockstar when it comes to VLSI. He'll command your attention with brilliantly simple explanations of often complex concepts and pepper his lectures with amusing stories that keep you engaged. And that is of the utmost importance in his class because as a rule, ""anything that appears on the board is fair game for the tests"". Which brings us to the second thing you will realize in class - He does not teach from the textbook. Although Weste and Harris (which is an excellent book, in my opinion) is the prescribed textbook for the course, Shepard rarely teaches anything straight out of it. In addition to that, one may also have to reference Rabaey (too wordy, in my opinion) from time to time. Hence this is my advice. Take down every single syllable, every phoneme that comes out of Shepard's mouth, because notes are everything in this class.
Problem Sets - Total 10 PSets (20% of the grade)
Other than the first couple of PSets, all of them build upto the final project, which is the design of a functional 8-Bit ""simple"" microcontroller. All PSets are long and all PSets are difficult, without exception. 
Most PSets in grad school are above average difficulty level. Shepard's problems are slightly more difficult than that. He'll give you two weeks to finish the first four homework assignments, couple of which are pen and paper. The TA recitations were really helpful in getting the homework done. Afterward, when you start working on the Cadence Virtuoso and layout based problems, the assignments are due weekly and it's a nightmare to submit on time. I have two very important pieces of advice about this:
1. DO NOT START LATE. None of the PSets can be finished in a day or even two. Start as early as possible. Because I promise, it takes centuries to get the hang of everything and it takes millennia to get your layout DRC and LVS clean. 
2. FEAR THE SRAM. The SRAM circuitry is the most nightmarish part of the entire design. Know that you'll have a terrible week, when that is due. 
Project - (15% of the grade)
PUT AS MUCH THOUGHT INTO YOUR CHOICE OF A PROJECT PARTNER AS YOU WOULD WITH THE CHOICE OF A SPOUSE. The project needs two people working in tandem all the time, and even then it is barely doable within the deadline. You cannot afford to slack or have a project partner who would do so. 
Exams - One midterm (25% of the grade) and one Final (40% of the grade)
The exams are a mixed bag. A culpa review said that exams are mostly based on previous years' questions, a claim corroborated by students who had taken the course before us. But while that was fairly true for the midterm examination, the final was a different story altogether. Therefore I think it is fair to say that the exam difficulty depends mostly on Shepard's whimsy. As long as you've gone through everything covered in class though, you should be fine. 
This class is what Stockholm Syndrome would look like if it were a grad school course. It is a semester's worth of pure torture, anguish, pain, and agony. But it is easily one of the best courses I have taken in my entire life. Shepard is an amazing instructor and you get to learn a lot. Plus you get fairly proficient with working on the Cadence Virtuoso tool, which is an industry standard and therefore a neat skill to have on your resume. 
Be prepared to spend all your time in the lab and to live on a steady diet of caffeine and junk food from the first floor vending machine in Mudd if you are planning to take the course next Fall.

Advanced Logic Design is a very thorough, very well structured, and meticulously planned course - exactly like Nowick, who teaches it. 
Nowick goes through every topic in excruciating detail, but in the process tries to make sure that everyone in the class is following. This can sometimes cause him to be repetitive and boring, but that is just how he teaches. In fact, Nowick is one of those old school, proper chalk and blackboard kinda instructor who likes using multicolor chalks and handmade diagrams to explain his subject matter. I found this approach to be very useful as an effective learning tool, although I know some people who would disagree with me. 
The course covers an entire range of topics and starts off at the most basically level, quickly yet steadily building up to more advanced concepts in Digital Logic Design. It is an essential course to take if you are interested in digital circuits especially hardware design.  
Nowick is particularly helpful during office hours, always willing to go over concepts with you. In class, he encourages questions and one can see that he wants every single person in the room to follow what he is trying to explain.

3. Projects are extremely time-consuming, considerably difficult and have a lot of annoying documentation work along with them, which Nowick insists upon.
It is not an impossibly hard course but is very competitive, with class averages always very high for all homework assignments and tests. One small slip can often cost you your grade, since the competition is so fierce.

Ryan is a sweet guy who is passionate about music. To be honest, I didn't really like him at first. He's soft spoken, somewhat too young, and sounds a little boring. But he quickly grew on me and I really appreciated attending his class! He is a composer and a drummer (weird mix right) and so his perspective on music is really quite interesting. He sometimes throws in his own experience in attending a conservatory and the weird things he learned. Overall, I learned a lot about music from this class and I want to recommend him to everyone who needs to take music hum. Don't stress yourself about music hum. With Ryan, you will learn something for sure and certainly get a good grade.

I don't think Zachary Herz was a very successful professor. I didn't enjoy CC and it seems like the majority of my class agreed with me, since only 4 students didn't switch out of his section. He often let students take over discussions and was easily distracted, which invariably led to good portions of every class being dedicated to topics completely unrelated to the texts. He seemed proud of this, and thought that it made his class ""entertaining"", but I would have liked to have learned something from CC. Personally, I didn't find him a very pleasant person either, especially when he made fun of some students who left the class. I make fun of people too, but I'm not their professor. 
He grades harder than your average professor, especially on your weekly responses. 
If you're really interested in law, he's really knowledgeable about that and spends a lot of the class discussing legal issues in the texts, but if you're not I would recommend avoiding his class.

I didn’t enjoy this class, but other people did. Professor Condillac really likes her own ideas and tends to push them on her students, which really annoyed me. I am going to college to learn how to express my own ideas, not regurgitate my professor’s. Expect to write essays about what she thinks your saying (after barely skimming your paper) rather than what you actually want to write about. The people who enjoyed this class seemed to have ideas that were very similar to hers and were often in awe of her ideas. 
Also, Professor Condillac tends to silence people by passing over what they say if she doesn’t think it matches with what she is saying. She doesn’t help people she disagrees with or doesn’t understand express their ideas, even though learning to express your ideas is the whole point of college, especially a women’s college. She also doesn’t give many comments on first drafts and takes a long time to give them back. 
Overall, if you don’t mind having to rewrite your essay to fit her ideas after every meeting with her, you will be fine. If you actually want to learn how to express your own ideas and be an independent thinker, maybe consider taking a different class. Either way, you will probably be fine grade wise; it’s more of a decision about how much you want to learn.

Prof Krimmel is fantastic! Incredibly knowledgeable in her field (not a single question throughout the whole semester was not met by a detailed and comprehensive answer) but also kind and caring about her students. Lectures were very detailed and often covered the readings directly, so a lot of the reading not necessary, but still learned an enormous amount. Only downside is that lectures were sometimes dry as they turned into a long list of facts (though she was always willing to take questions if there were some). However, she would try to make at least one of the two weekly lectures discussion-based, which was great.
Superb course overall, gave me a very solid foundation in the academic study not just of political parties, but of American politics more broadly.

If you are expecting a perfectly organized and predictable lecture on corruption theory, do not take this class. However, if you enjoy open discussion on current events and divergent thinking on politics,  TAKE THIS CLASS! Some people might not like his impromptu presentation but I would say it actually help to stimulate critical thinking. Professor Lu often connects abstract theories with specific practices in daily life, which, in my opinion, is one of the best methods to learn political science.
Meanwhile, Professor Lu is always eager to help. He welcomes all kinds of questions including inquiries on the assignment, lecture or career in general. He is also willing to discuss your research paper with you extensively before the deadline. 
As for getting an A, I feel like choosing the right topic for your research paper is extremely crucial. Professor Lu will urge everyone to present her proposal a month before the ddl. If Professor Lu does not challenge your topic much, that probably means you are on the right track.

Very good professor. She was my most enthusiastic lecturer that I've had so far, and I really enjoyed going to her class (I took Methods for Social Research with her). The writing assignments for the class are reasonable and educational. My only gripe is that I wish we did more work with the readings (i.e: if you're going to assign 3+ hours of reading a week, at least give students a good chance to show that they've read it). I didn't really like the haphazard nature of the pop-quizzes. But other than that --- she really is an excellent lecturer and I'm glad that Columbia has her hired.

It's been years since I took this class with Professor Rosner. I did my work, got my B+, and ran away as fast as I could. So why am I writing this review, you ask? To warn you. Of what, you ask? Well, where to begin...
For starters, I've never encountered a professor who is as insecure of their own discipline as Professor Rosner. I can still recall her standing in front of a class full of nineteen-year-olds, trying to explain why English is a more ""honorable"" and ""noble"" line of study than the sciences or how those who study English (i.e., English professors) are the sole gatekeepers able to unlock the hidden meaning in literary texts. To this day I still cringe when I think about her teaching style, how many heads were absentmindedly nodding while she was proselytizing, and how often she felt the need to pat herself on the back.
Speaking of her teaching: I didn't learn a damn thing except for maybe an obscure Greek or Latin word or phrase to sound even douchier. Every moment of every class she wasn't slamming other subjects she talked about the ways in which English as a discipline has evolved without ever challenging the class or, more importantly, herself to think about how it *should* exist. Silly me, I actually wanted to think about the human condition and its relation to literature, but all I got out of this class was the definition of solipsism and the knowledge that decades ago English consisted of rote memorization and recitation. Several grand well spent!
Lastly, to do well in this class one will most likely have to give her what she wants. That was my impression during the class, and reading the other reviews confirms my suspicion. This doesn't mean that Professor Rosner's class was easy; it's just that this class was challenging for all the wrong reasons. I felt I was being graded not on my ability to think or write or articulate a point but on my ability to regurgitate whatever Professor Rosner wanted to see.
How is any of that learning, you ask? I came to the realization long ago that it's not. Hopefully this review will lead you to the same conclusion.

I won't rehash all the things that have been said about Professor Haider in much detail. There is a lot of work, and sometimes the readings can be repetitive. Every week you have to write a blog post, and he grades them on a scale of quarter points up to 10.0, but in reality you will likely never get above a 9.5. My average over the semester was probably between and 9.0 and a 9.25, and I got an A. So don't worry too much because he will curve it. 
He is very exacting, sometimes almost to a fault. He can seem to be blind to the fact that his own criticisms are not ironclad. Absolutely make sure you meet with him early in the semester during his office hours. He appreciates getting to know his students. 
As has been said, he's very old school. He is intimidating in his comments, exacting in his standards, and demanding in his expectations for independent thought. 
Tips: try to tie in outside sources that relate in an unexpected but thoughtful way. Prepare for a lot of reading, and be judicious in what you read and how closely. Don't be afraid to challenge his views, but know how to back it up and anticipate his criticisms so you can address them on the fly. He truly is a quality over quantity person; he's not just saying that. 
Overall, I would highly recommend him to someone that can devote the time and energy he requires of you.

This course was one of my favorite at Columbia. Professor Lax is brilliant, witty and deft at explaining often complex topics in a field that is traditionally not taught at the undergraduate level. This also explains why the course content is entirely from going to lecture and actively focusing to absorb material instead of through textbooks or reading. 
This is unlike most political science courses at Columbia, and I really appreciated how it opened up a different way of thinking. He openly acknowledges his poor handwriting, though repeats material and is open to questions. The grading was tough though fair- work hard, ask questions to him in class and TAs, and you should do fine.

Like most, I was fulfilling a requirement, and I did not expect how fun and educational the class would be because of Professor Rothe's excellent teaching. He consistently was very prepared and did a great job of discussing pieces as how they were representative (or not) of a broader historical time period. He would actively encourage us to return to the key concepts and descriptors we learned in the beginning and use them as tools to analyze the music, which I felt was helpful for reinforcing them. 
It is clear how passionate he is about the subject when he discusses experiences like his visit to Notre-Dame or shares his favorite musicians and their work. He also had a fun sense of humor that made class more enjoyable. If you have a chance, Music Hum with Professor Rothe is a great experiences.

If you're taking Logic of Collective Choice with Professor Lax, don't.  This pastiche of disorganisation amalgamates into a cesspool of confusion and contempt - contempt at the otherwise interesting subject matter.  Allow me to elucidate what I believe the problems to be.
Firstly, this course does not come with any reference material - no textbooks, no online resources, and no handouts.  Attending his bi-weekly lectures are akin to receiving a divine edict - Lax preaches, you absorb.  Basically, you sit yourself down, take out a note pad, and copy down whatever is on the board.  This proves to be extremely tricky during the two midterms he doles out as the subject content that was once fresh in your memory tends to fade, naturally, as the weeks go by.  Without a point of reference, you get so lost.
Secondly, the lack of overall support.  The stressors brought about by a lack of reference materials could easily be alleviated by knowledgeable teaching assistants who, from the goodness of their hearts, will decide to impart this information during office hours.  This was not the case - Jordan and Javier, the two TAs who accompanied Lax in this process, were equally as clueless as we were.
While I did relatively okay for the class, >10% of his students were awarded an appalling D grade.  Please only take this class if your GPA does not matter to you.
Workload:

Took Science of Psych in  Fall 2016; As a non-science major who has absolutely zero interest in the sciences, this class wasn't that bad. 
Professor Lindemann is a good professor, is really nice, and knows the material well. If you pay attention, do the extra credit, and actually study, it would be easy to get good grades (I P/D/F'ed the course b/c I didn't do any of the three). Its important to pay attention to the lectures because the open-end questions on the tests are mostly related to the material that she lectures on, while the multiple choice is related to the textbook. 
My main complaint for this course is the grading of the essays. Most of the TA's are undergraduate students, who are like yourself, mostly either juniors or sophomores. The grading for the essays can be REALLY harsh, but the criteria of grading is very vague. They check off a rubric, so, for example, if they ""think"" you didn't connect the concepts between an article and concept right, they will dock points. And when you go to them asking why they docked off points, they give vague/unclear explanations and they themselves don't know why. You can never know what the hell standards they base it off of. I compared my essay with a friend's who had gotten a much better score, but we both agreed that both papers were similar in quality. One TA told me that they were told that if they ""think the paper generally seemed like a B paper"" to adjust the scores accordingly. Really? Then why the fuck do we have a rubric in the first place? For example, I got points docked off for weird wording, but as a humanities major and having read the essay over 10 times, I'm pretty sure that there was nothing off about the grammar/syntax/wording of the essay. 
After meeting with TA's for my first two essays, I immediately P/D/F'ed the course, because the grading is really subjective and I knew my final grade would take a toll. BASICALLY, while the TA's may know concepts and can grade tests objectively, they don't know how the hell to grade papers. That being said, I didn't particularly dislike the TA's (they were really helpful in several aspects), but that I don't trust their expertise or experience in grading papers with an objective eye.

I cannot recommend enough. Professor Porzak was a delight to behold, and (I felt) he guided me through my first semester. 
He is at first snarky and fun (our class spent most of our time chuckling), but is most of all desperately smart. He thinks critically at an inspirationally high level. He would be played by Billy Eichner, but Porzak would sooner diss Decarthes than Sienna Miller (I believe Porzak would also like me to note that he is more handsome - sorry Billy). 
If you like wit in a teacher you'll be pleased. 
Notably he gives his notes on drafts in youtube videos where you can see your draft as his voice gives you notes on it. I found this to be extremely valuable. Nobody else does that!
My favorite Porzak moment of the semester was when I went to his office hours to last minute switch the exhibit (subject) for our P3. In an instant he told me the root of what I was really talking about and without leaving his chair he handed me his copy of Walter Benjamin that had an annotated chapter that became the core of my argument. 
It can also be noted that the copy of Benjamin was annotated in multiple languages! Also that I still have it, but I plan to return it Friday with a batch of homemade soft pretzels because I'm lame and also I can't thank him enough for all the time and care he put into our class. 
Workload:
Normal P1, P2, P3, P4 cycle. (note he's not so stressed on deadlines as long as the work is good).
He assigns more pages of reading than other UW professors I've heard about, BUT the texts he assigns are entertaining and are also from the world's best minds. Everything substantial that we read was written by someone who got brought up in my other classes (even in my Intro to Film class). Any writing that isn't deeply significant (I guess if you care about post-structuralism), is funny and easy to read.  Overall, very well curated. 
The assigned homework on the readings aren't for a grade and Porzak didn't really seem to care about them. We all eventually stopped turning them in.

This woman was easily the worst teacher I have ever had, and I spent two years in community college before attending Columbia. She will come in to the class each day, read directly off of slides (which are copied word for word from the text book) for 75 minutes, do no examples, give maybe 5-10 questions to study, and leave. I approached her with questions several times, and did not receive satisfactory answers. There was one day that she was not present for, so the TA taught that class, and he was a far better lecturer than her. The class actually applauded him at the end.
The icing on the cake is the fact that each day there is a ""pop quiz"" that covers the material being taught in class. That means that you have to have read and understood the relevant chapter in the book so that you can then come to class, have it read to you again word for word, and then be quizzed on it.
If not for the fact that I had to drop the course to preserve my GPA (taking a bunch of other math classes and have never gotten less than a B+ btw) I would have filed a formal complaint with the school.

Professor Simpson was one of the best professors I've had at Columbia by far. She really is completed invested in her research on Native Americans around the world (most specifically in the US and Canada though), but that does not mean that she doesn't bring 110% to class every day. You can really tell how important it is to her that we knew this history and its implications in today's world. Though this class is about Native Americans, we talked about indigineity a lot as a concept which I think was her way of preparing us to apply what we learned to other indigenous groups that we did not get the chance to study. If you did all the readings, your workload would be pretty heavy...the class only meets once a week so if you're good at time management you'll be able to complete them, which I'd recommend because the readings are fascinating and so informative. However, it is not completely necessary to do all the readings and she won't quiz you on them.  As the class goes on, however, you'll probably feel inclined to do more of the readings because you'll begin to realize how important it is for you to have this information. Professor Simpson presents her lectures in a way that makes you understand the gravity of what you're learning and its importance for the future of Native Americans.
Besides all that, Professor Simpson is incredibly hilarious. She was always cracking jokes to lighten the mood (the content can be difficult/heavy), and her humor was the kind that startles you at first, but in a way that's really appreciated.

TAKE THIS CLASS (And any class with Professor Gupta)! Professor Gupta is an amazing teacher, presenting the course information in a clear and engaging way. She often supplements her lectures with real life examples that she has gathered from her patients in her practice in Tribeca. Professor Gupta is extremely clear in the expectations of the course and is understanding of her students. Her exams are thorough, can be tricky, but extremely fair. If you pay attention in class and do the textbook reading, you can excel in the course. 
One of the best qualities that Professor Gupta possesses is the way in which she makes herself accessible to students.

So if you're looking for an interesting class with a huge participation grade, but hard grading, pick this course.

Ignore the negative reviews below. If you just care about an easy grade and not learning, this class is perfect. Anyone complaining is lazy and doesn't know how to work for themselves. 
Pros-
1. Only meet once a week
2. No homework
3. No research paper (which other stats sections have)
4. No programming needed
5. Ridiculously easy quizzes every class meeting (lots of time to complete, 1 question, collaboration is allowed)
6. 3 exams (including final) and none of them are cumulative. they are extremely straight forward. you are allowed a cheat sheet, and 2 cheat sheets on the final which is not cumulative. 
7. 3 exams means less material on each exam than compared to just a midterm and final
8. very generous class curve
Cons-
1. kolluri not very email responsive
2. she reads straight from her slides (not really a big deal because the slides are fantastic)
3. boring, but you can literally do whatever you want in class 
Overall: Highly recommend if you just want the easy grade. Relative to the other stats sections, this class is MINIMALLY stressful.

Take this review with a grain of salt, because I only sat in on one class with Professor Kozak before dropping the class. Just wanted to note that the way Professor Kozak teaches Music Hum is with two tracks: One day each week, he focuses on music and its qualities (the way you might in most Music Hums); the other day, he talks about the socio-political ramifications of listening. This involves all sorts of identity politics, talking about why we privilege Western, classical music over other forms of music, and breaking down that prejudice.
Professor Kozak seems like a great teacher. His emphasis on the social and historical background, motivations, and consequences of different pieces seems fascinating, and I'm sure he'll teach that well. There's also no question that his politics line up with a particular strand that's extremely popular on campus. For that reason, many will see his class as a breath of fresh air, and a way to make music relevant to the world as a whole/activism/social justice. On the other hand, those looking for a traditional Music Hum experience where they'll actually learn the core elements of music (albeit with far less focus on the historical circumstances that gave rise to that music) will find that this class spends only half of its time - at best - on that subject.

I first registered for History of Photography as a Pass/D/Fail course uncertain of what the workload or expectations would be. I was pleasantly surprised to find Prof. Alberro's lectures on History of Photography accessible and easy to understand. Readings were well-integrated into class discussions during the first half of the semester and the workload was manageable (nothing a bit of studying could not overcome).
I was fortunate enough to have an excellent TA, which I found made a significant difference in aiding my comprehension of lecture. Molly worked hard to synthesize readings and explain them in a clear and accessible way to students. She took time to read over our work line by line and to offer extensive comments (in legible script), which facilitated studying for projects and exams later in the semester.
I find many students are hesitant to take courses from graduate students, given perceived ""lack of experience"" and ""unfamiliarity"" with the material. However, I found Molly's explanations to be on-point and her knowledge of the material extensive. As a grad student and teaching fellow, only a few years older than her students, I think she was able to connect with students and clearly explain complex concept more readily than someone far older and ostensibly ""versed"" in the material.
I appreciate the efforts she made to get to know students individually and to explain her grading of the midterm exam and assignments. Papers and emails were promptly returned, and student questions/concerns were consistently addressed.
Though I took this course as an elective, I would definitely recommend to students interested in art history as a not too demanding and stress-free course. Alberro cares about his students and adjusts his workload/expectations to reflect the fact that, as Columbia students, we often take more courses than we can handle.

The class is all about using AWS services to make web apps. You just need to make things work and show them to get marks. Lots of time is wasted in debugging and doing silly things that don't teach you cloud computing, but just DEBUGGING.
The cloud concepts are somewhat covered in lectures partially and you are expected to learn yourself too through readings assigned every week.
Overall, a good but unorganized course with more workload than it is supposed to have. You will definitely learn about many cloud technologies and will be able to make simple cloud apps that can impress someone.

Professor Sumati Gupta is an exceptional professor. She clearly does other things besides teach this course, and so manages her time exceptionally well. 
She has power point slides for each lecture that give the basic subheadings that we need to know, and it is our duty to go to class and pay attention to what she says and take down notes.
Her intention is for us to learn and absorb what she teaches, and most definitely not to trick us. 
If she confuses you and herself in the process of explaining a concept, she will make sure to not include it in the exam and let you know of her decision so you don't waste time studying it. 
In her exam review sessions, she will make whats going to be tested very clear- giving you a break up of how much each chapter constitutes the exam. 
Overall- A great class, she never took attendance but something about her and her teaching made you want to go each time, a guaranteed A if you study exactly what she asks you to study and a class I would definitely recommend!

I took this course as a first-year in the fall. Since it was an upper-level course, I was nervous about the workload. Professor Colgrove and the TAs, however, were approachable both in person and responded to emails to help answer any questions I had about the readings and/or the 2 papers (mid-term and final). The class itself did not fall short of my expectations whatsoever because of my deep interest in public health, but more importantly, the social determinants of health. Although it was an 8:40 class, Colgrove masters the art of PowerPoints and organizes his lectures with interactive videos and role-plays about public health practices during the 19th Century helped me interact and engage so early in the morning. With all that being said, TAKE HIS CLASS. YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. He's a great person to talk to as well if you intend to pursue a career in public health bc he works at the Mailman School.

Professor Waters was excellent. He's new to Columbia and possibly new to teaching in general, however I have never seen a teacher so well prepared yet capable of going off script. Every class he gave us a sheet containing all the important terms and buildings. He also build the class around five themes that he managed to flesh out and make clear. 
He also managed to make the discussion sections more substantial than going over what was said in lecture. Each one added to the overall themes and often included short field trips. 
I see a gold nugget in the making.

Very reasonable. The readings generally were short articles or passages from architectural books. We wrote five short (500 word) response papers and had four building recognition quizzes.

This was the most imperial and neocolonial class I have ever taken at Barnard/Columbia. I genuinely want to save any first year from ever taking this class because the overriding message of the entire course was that Third World Countries commit the most violence and are in need of Western countries to go in and change them. The class completely lacked in any critical analysis of human rights as a field / justification for Western imperialism, and completely lacked in tying violence that happens around the world to the human rights abuses of Western civilization. My TA literally asked me once what the American military should do about a conflict between a government in a Southeast Asian country and the indigenous people that live there - as if he was advocating that the American military should enter into the conflict.
If you are taking or thinking about taking this class, please do not trust the readings or the professor. HIs framework is ultimately oriented around imperialism and white supremacy, even though he's a nice guy.

I completely disagree with the previous review (from November 2016). I was in the same class, and I thought Nomaduma was an amazing instructor. She went above and beyond teaching us the standardized Art Humanities curriculum, especially when it came to questioning both the course and art history's acceptance of racism and sexism. She definitely knows what she is talking about and gave our class an insightful perspective into the masterpieces selected by the Core office. She also went to Columbia University for both undergrad and her graduate program so she understands what it's like to be a student here.
I 100% would take her class again and recommend it to anyone looking for an intelligent and approachable teacher. Her assignments were very straightforward, and I really enjoyed working on the final project. I came into this course not knowing anything about Art History or even how to think about a piece of art. Nomaduma completely transformed my ability to both look at art and interrogate social institutions.

José is one of the best professors you can take a class with at Columbia. Period. I took a 5:40-6:55 class with him on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, but he never made this class boring. I always looked forward to taking class with him, and as someone who had zero experience with Spanish before taking Spanish I and II with him, I admit that it was intimidating at first. But I guarantee you that he will make you fall in love with Spanish and him. 
First of all, there will be no English spoken in the classroom. And it's unbelievably helpful in picking up a foreign language, because you're forced to quickly adapt to listening to and speaking Spanish. But I think for someone who didn't know any Spanish at all, his kindness, enthusiasm, humor and care for his students made the language as a whole extremely attractive. 
In terms of grades, as long as you return his enthusiasm and show that you are willing to be serious about learning the language and that you care, you will get a good grade. I personally didn't deserve the grade I received, but because I had never missed a single class and always participated, I got a grade better than I expected. 
That said, I found it incredibly disrespectful that other students took advantage of his easy-going and casual nature to talk while he was lecturing, or refuse to speak Spanish, or simply just not attend class. The thing is, by disrespecting him and not taking his classes seriously, you're doing yourself a disservice by not taking advantage of this brilliant professor.  
José deserves every single teaching award that could possibly be given to a professor, and I'm so incredibly fortunate to have been able to take this class with him. I'm still taking Spanish even though I've already fulfilled my language requirement with something else, and although the professors I have taken since then are also brilliant, I will always miss José.

Professor Jacobs is a wonderful professor. She's highly engaging and encourages students to engage with the material in a way that both sharpens our historical skills and encourages connections and analysis with other parts of history, especially our present. 
Her seminars were focused around helping us develop the skills and timeline needed to write a 15 page research paper. She takes this seriously. She will help you every step of the way and give structured assignments to take you through formulating a topic, researching and assembling a corpus of material, and finally writing. She gives feedback at every step and is willing to help you at her office hours constantly. This also ties into how the readings are structured to help you with your historical skills, particularly argumentation, as she'll mention frequently that your job in writing the research paper is to present an argument with evidence, just as the authors you read in class do. She ran the seminar incredibly well, incorporating our weekly work in with the readings, and often brought in cookies or other treats for class. Readings for Consumer Culture included two novels, a book on fast food, a book on Wal-Mart and a book about the baby boom. Readings for Nuclear Age included a book about the baby boom, detente, African American movements, the oil crisis, the Iran hostage crisis and the origins of environmentalism. Both classes involved readings, primary sources and a short, two page analysis (weekly), a 5 page primary source journal (where you summarize your sources) and a 15 page research paper (which, as I've written, she helps you with extensively). 
The lecture class was a very standard lecture, focusing more on the material than on developing your own history paper. The topic was fairly narrow -- the Roaring 20s, the Depression years and World War II, and then a bit of the post-War period. The years covered are about 1920 to about 1950, covering primarily the presidencies of Roosevelt and Truman, with special attention paid to the government and responses to the government, as well as issues of class, consumption, labor, race and gender. Her lectures were engaging and interesting, and covered a lot in very little time. Very little was said about military history or about the battles of World War II. Readings focused on the economic crash in 1929, people's responses to Roosevelt, demagogues like Huey Long and Francis Townsend, the impact of World War II on the home front and on veterans, as well as primary sources outlining government policy and response during the Roosevelt years. Discussion section focused on improving our understanding of the reading alongside material from the lectures. Assignments included only two exams (term and passage IDs, as well as one essay, the prompts she gives in advance) and a short five-page paper based on newspaper research (which should be easy for anyone who has written any type of history paper based on primary work). 
As a professor, Professor Jacobs is truly a gem and not to be missed. Her classes are interesting and timely, and her passion for teaching is obvious and welcomed. She'll also learn your name on the first go (seriously, only one introduction needed)! I wholeheartedly recommend professor Jacobs if you have any interest at all in the topics she's teaching. 
Workload:
As mentioned above: 
Seminars involved about 100 to 150 pages of reading a week, a 15 page research paper, intermediate assignments for the research paper, weekly primary sources and analysis, and a five page ""journal."" The primary sources involved finding and analyzing a primary source related to the reading, and the ""journal"" was a five page summary at the end of the semester where you place them in a sort of narrative or reflective arc. She incorporates the primary sources into the discussion so there's a chance to participate every single time class meets. The intermediate assignments for the paper are ungraded but are meant to be for your benefit, as she gives notes and feedback based on them. Intermediate assignments include a paper proposal, revised paper proposal, preliminary bibliography of primary and secondary sources, an introduction and outline, a rough draft and then the final paper. 
Lecture was about 100 to 150 pages of reading a week, a five page essay and two exams (term IDs, passage IDs from the readings, and essays, the prompts for which she gives you in advance). Weekly discussion section that involved discussing the readings and incorporating them in with the material from lecture (my TA assigned no additional work). The five page essay involved analyzing a debate presented in class (e.g. the Lend-Lease Act) through newspaper research on ProQuest. A very easy assignment if you have done any type of historical work with primary sources before, and a very gentle introduction if you haven't.

One of the worst classes to take- strongly advised against taking this course.
The faculty initially starts with a study-plan that seems great on paper, but is seldom followed as promised. One of the key points of the class is said to be ""REVIEW SESSIONS"" - where the professors help the students come up with business Ideas.
Not only were these sessions unfruitful, they were often confusing; with the professors' changing their stance on an idea every alternate session. The professors require that we come up with innovative ideas, yet they outright reject any direction that they think may not be interesting.
Rather than having a discussion about an idea, or even giving a new direction to the same, the faculties insist on changing the proposal - even up till the last few weeks!
There is hardly any incentive on the amount of hard-work given in the class, as your grade only depends on whether the professor likes the final presentation or not.
More often than not, it seems that the professors make a call by the mid-terms about every group and barely change their grading, despite the amount of effort put in.
This is not only unfair to people who are not grasping the ideas taught outright but also rewards those groups that have been judged positively over other groups in a biased manner. There seems to be no scope for improvement for people who are lagging behind, or whose ideas the professors do not agree with.
Rather than being an academic experience, the course simply boils down to an episode of Shark Tank.

I never do these things... but for Professor Elliott I just felt as though I had a responsibility to warn people.
The man is a certified lunatic.  He's one of those CC teachers where looks can be deceiving.  He comes across super gregarious and fun and engaging and sucks you in.  But he's definitely one of those teachers where he forgets that you're taking other classes apart from his own.  He has you submit multiple discussion board posts per class so if you fall even a little bit behind on the reading... you're effectively screwed.  And each one requires so much reading and so much evaluation that you're pretty much working on it up until the point of submission.  
If that isn't bad enough, he hands you a list of 25 or so questions that you're supposed to answer for each reading... as if we're in high school and we're filling out a worksheet to prove to the teacher that you have basic comprehension skills.  But they're so distracting that you're not able to process and absorb the material in your own way since you're too consumed with trying to answer the questions that he deems important.    
He's one of the only CC teachers open every semester because people just do not want to deal.  I promise you that if you take his class you will regret it.  Run while you can.

Wow I'm pretty surprised by the negative reviews of this professor. I took Third World Studies with him and I found both the readings (though heavy) and his lectures to be really powerful and thought-provoking. He definitely comes to class with I guess what some might call his ""opinions"" but every professor has opinions and political standpoints, and Prof Okihiro is definitely open - and very encouraging - of having conversations about his lectures and the readings. All these comments about how he hates white people pretty much reflect how upset white people felt about taking a class that analyzed the power of our subject position and centered scholars and theorists of color. 
Professor Okihiro is incredibly sweet, incredibly smart, and very articulate about the different power structures at play both in the US and globally.

Augustin is a very enthusiastic, friendly guy. He goes out of his way to encourage people to speak during class, even as far as to buy apples before class and give them to people who raise their hand and participate in any way. You can respond to one of his questions correctly, incorrectly, you can ask him to repeat the question, you can ask ""may I please get an apple"", as long as some sound passes between your lips he will give you an apple.
This class was much more theoretical than I anticipated. Augustin attempts to summarize papers on sociology, graph theory, social psychology or other topics related to models of large-scale social behavior. Some of the models make sense, for others he makes no attempt to prove that they reflect real-life trends; they simply seem like one person's interpretation of a complicated phenomenon.
After giving a bit of intuition for the motivation for the model of the day, he dives into a heavily mathematical proof for all sorts of bounds relating to the proof which can quickly become overwhelming. He often lingers on finishing up algebra for longer than necessary, but then makes overestimates our knowledge of certain statistical / linear algebraic theorems and rushes through parts of the proof that seem to fly over most people's heads.
The homeworks usually involve taking the ideas covered in class and generalizing them and proving those generalizations, which was almost impossible to do on one's own. Nothing is googleable.
As other people have said, Augustin is very disorganized. His homeworks are hodgepodges of older homeworks along with new questions hastily written with minimal proofreading. The data challenges took a while to put together, and when they came out we had relatively little time to prepare our setups. The TAs did not fully understand a lot of the material, and we would often have to ""learn together"" during office hours. For a 4995, this class felt more like a 6998 (which I believe it used to be).

4 HWs: Some proofs in the beginning (all pretty difficult), occasionally a programming question, and then a few short-answer questions at the end that required you to apply some ideas from class to a hypothetical situation (rather easy).
There was going to be an essay, but due to disorganization he gave it to us as a bonus assignment...to be done over winter break after the class had ended
Midterm: if you looked through the practice midterm carefully you had a decent amount of the material covered. The problem is he has this ridiculous format that involves picking one, multiple, or none of the multiple choice options, and then writing a short justification below of your choices. The short justification did not seem to matter
Final: Again, look through the practice midterm carefully and you'll have a lot of it covered.
Data Challenge: First one was very tricky, took me probably 17-18 hours total, it's very difficult to know how close you are to a good solution until you get there. Second one was stupidly simple in comparison, required very rudimentary data analysis, as long as you made sure to mention a bunch of topics from class and tie them into your findings then you were fine

This was Jessica's first semester teaching (she's a PhD student in Computer Science), but that's not necessarily a bad thing. She was always prepared for questions and had reasonably thought out lecture material. I've heard that her class was harder than Ansaf's but that's not necessarily bad either. More importantly, Jessica is relatively engaging in class, helpful at office hours, offers (maybe too much) extra credit and does all she can to make sure you learn and do well in the class.
A side note: a lot of people fled this class when the first week finished because she assigned far too much material, but she recalibrated after everyone let her know.
Workload:
HW assigned weekly (5-8 questions usually)
   - Both proofs and computation
   - Generally quite doable given the time frame
   - Harder than the tests
2 Midterms (75 minutes each)
   - Each covered several chapters
   - Reasonable in difficulty, and she gave hints on the one question everyone got stuck on
   - She adjusted the scores on one of them
Final
   - Cumulative, but with the bulk of the material covering the last third
   - comparable to a midterm but longer

This class covers a lot of material (1000's of years) so there's a lot to know, and because it's an art history class, you're gonna be expected to know a lot of things for the tests. However, Reynolds is a decently engaging lecturer and is definitely passionate about the material. The subject is quite interesting with him at the helm, however, I found the readings quite dull.
I did poorly on the midterm and relatively well on the final, despite the fact that I only read for the first 2/3 of the semester. This suggests that you need to study the slides and Reynolds' favorite topics more than you need to know every reading.
I was able to pick out what he seemed to think was most important (Isozaki, Maekawa, Todaiji, Katsura just to name a few) without much difficulty
Workload:
The bulk of the grades were a midterm and final (maybe like 75%) and then the remainder was a couple papers. We had one that was pass fail, and then a more comprehensive viewing assignment that ""required"" going to the Met. Naturally, the Met is not the last place you'd want to be, so you should go, but it's not necessary.
The midterm and final were IDs (picture on screen, identify artist, approx date (generous), followed by slightly more in depth IDs with descriptions, followed by several short essays about the aforementioned important topics.

He's actually a nice guy if you go to his office hours.
On the other hand, he's very strange and hard to digest. His lectures are dense with proofs and unrelated material to the class. For example, he would talk about moment generating functions during most lectures, but they would not appear on a single assignment or test. Further, none of the assignments or tests have a single proof.
His lectures had only maybe 20% of the students showing up (I'm not sure why I even attended since it was hard to pay attention).

Cannon is a very engaging lecturer who explains the material pretty well. His jokes elicit a non-zero amount of laughs consistently, he jokingly thinks the class hates him, and he gives you riddles that have only a tangential relation to the class. 
More importantly, this class provides you with a bunch of background knowledge for CS, moreso than any Java programming proficiency, something that will come in Data Structures. It's a wide breadth with a little depth, but he and the TAs do an admirable job explaining concepts and answering questions, preparing you for the (reasonable) midterm and final.

HW: It's weighted quite high, with alternating problem sets and programming assignments week by week. You get some credit if your code compiles and if your style is good, which is good if you can't figure something out once in a while.

Martha Kim was a great lecturer. She basically followed the textbook's cues, but she did put effort into explaining the material, taking questions, and teaching well. She is genuine and helpful during office hours and tends toward leniency. She never came off as jaded, mean-spirited, or apathetic, like a lot of professors here do. When students pointed out to her that a large CS Theory assignment and a large AP lab were both due on the same day as one of her assignments, she agreed to push her deadline back a few days and give us the weekend to work on it, which was pretty cool.
That being said, she really screwed up the grading for our semester. The first two projects were too easy, with median grades around 95, and the last project was too hard, with a median grade around 40. The curve depended mostly on the third project -- in other words, our performance in the class was more or less determined by one assignment. To some extent, she admitted that she made mistakes and was trying out the project-based assessment scheme for the first time, and she curved the class generously to compensate. I don't think she'll let that kind of thing happen again.
The TAs for the class were pretty bad. More often than not, it seemed like they didn't know what was going on. This could be attributed to the brand new set of projects Martha developed for the class, with which neither the TAs nor the students had any experience.
Overall, good teacher and very interesting material, but bad support from the teaching staff and very messy grading.

This was my favorite class I have ever taken so far at Barnard. PROFESSOR GUPTA IS A DELIGHT. She is so organized and timely and very knowledgeable about the material. This class expanded my knowledge on many many disorders and Professor Gupta's slides were concise and clear. She always encouraged questions and answered them honestly and to the best of her abilities. One of my favorite aspects of this class were the little anonymous anecdotes she would give about patients; it made the subject more relatable and was very interesting to hear. Another great thing she does is show video examples of people with a disorder which was a great tool to go back to help study for the exams and were very fascinating to watch. The workload was very light; all you have to do is come to class and pay attention to the lectures. The exam materials are almost entirely based on her lectures with only one or two questions from the textbook or articles. She even says herself that you can still get an A-/A on the exams without reading the textbook. Overall, if you're interested in learning about a range of psychological disorders this is the class for you; especially because it is taught by a current psychologist with many examples to give.

Professor Pazzaglini is one of the most powerful teachers I have ever met.  He cares tremendously about the course and his students.  He pulls thoroughly accurate and relevant quotes out of thin air.  He provides highly insightful advice that one can use in their academic or personal life, or both.  He has a passion for the subject, and it shows.  He encourages thoroughly interesting class discussions, in which everyone seems to participate without further prompting.  I do not think that I need to say more.  This is an exceptional course with an exceptional professor.

Professor Firmat is a very friendly person. This is what will be most salient to you in his class. He is kind, reasonable, engaged with the names and personalities of his students from the start, quick to respond to emails, and generally a really relaxed person.
That said, I am still trying to figure out what I got from his class. I do not understand what ""kind"" of interpretation he was providing of the text, as it seemed kind of unstructured and unspecific. I did not learn a lot about the works we were reading. We just read them and talked about their general context without ever doing any close reading or discussion of the broader contextual implications of the works.
Professor Firmat is also a really strange grader. Our final was to design a presentation-essay of the works we read as if we were introducing Latin American Literature to a group of students. This was really kind of directionless and a bit unprofessional in my opinion. Our midterms were in-class short interpretations of texts. I was at first happy with how quickly Gustavo graded the exams, but over time it seemed to me that Gustavo has little interest in what his students actually say, and that he might think they're not smart enough to say anything worth our time or his.
Overall I was really excited to take Gustavo's class because of all the great reviews, but I was thoroughly disappointed and I wish I had taken another class. Most days were pretty boring. Gustavo talks a lot. And sometimes, these talks are about irrelevant things; yes, he has a great knowledge of general literature and philosophy from Europe and the Americas, but so do many other professors. Gustavo's flaunting of this knowledge was kind of pointless and did not at all enrich my understanding of the texts we were actually studying. It seemed more like name-dropping.
Finally, I don't think my writing nor my reading improved at all in this class. His comments were unhelpful and I never could get a legitimate gauge of what he thought of my ideas or interpretations as he seemed to always have a positive attitude but never really provide any critical or useful feedback.
Overall, if you are serious about studying literature and culture and you want to get better at it and work with someone who will work with you, don't take Gustavo's class. If you want to take a fun course about literature and get an okay grade and spend time with a generally nice guy, you might like it. 
I would finally add that Gustavo kind of seems completely out of touch with many of the political issues presented in the texts. How can we read a work like Paz's ""Mexican Masks"" and not have a critical discussion of gender? I also think there were times when many students were offended by the texts that Gustavo assigned--not because the texts themselves are bad by their existence, but rather because Gustavo seems to present undying love for each of them, and often both women and students of color in the class were annoyed by his blasé and rhapsodic interpretations. There were many awkward discussions about nativism, mulatto identity, sex and gender, etc., and he seems to never understand how or why they are awkward or uncomfortable.
I did not really enjoy my time with Gustavo all that much.

This class was the worst experience at Columbia. The professor is unclear with his explanations, do not cover enough example problems in class, and runs late on schedule. Therefore, the last weeks were very rushed. Throughout the entire semester, I had to learn by myself from the textbook, which was also very hard to understand. Although I do not consider myself as a statistics genius, I do consider myself as a quick learner. However, the way the professor explained things made the material much harder than it actually is. The course brought my grades down, and deprived my motivation to study statistics. Do everything you can to avoid this class.

Manu wants you to develop your own ideas about what it means to be human. This class isn’t a lot of work. Manu is clearly really smart, but he doesn’t know how to give an engaging lecture so the class is pretty boring and everyone is on their computer. I felt bad not doing all the readings, but they are really long and he tends to try to summarize them in class. The class might be more interesting if you do them, but that’s up to you. 
Grading: you start at 93% and lose a small percentage every time you miss a class or a posting. There isn’t usually anyway you can make up what you missed.

Professor Robbins is a true gem within the English department.
I have taken multiple seminars with him, and each time I've come out of the semester with that rare twinge of enlightenment that this school promises to offer but only infrequently delivers upon. He is shrewd, witty, and a true conversationalist. Nowhere at Columbia have I felt more challenged nor more truly part of a rigorous academic (and sometimes its opposite) discussion than in his class. 
If you're reading this review, the only thing I can tell you is TAKE A COURSE WITH PROF. ROBBINS. Instructors like him are the reason we came to this university, and you should not take for granted the fact that accomplished and brilliant people like Bruce Robbins are willing to sit down and converse honestly with you and at most 12 or 13 other people about great (and also not-so-great) works of literature. You can take a lecture course on orgo chem or microeconomics at any university in the world, but we attend this school for the unique privilege of sharing an academic space with the likes of prof. Robbins.
Do it. Come to class. Read what he gives you. And become, at the very least, a more enlightened person because of it.

I know what you are thinking: ""what the hell is going on in this class? Are these people around me understanding anything? Should I drop this class? But it is a requirement for my major."" 
Don't worry, I am here to save you. What I can say about this class is that it is absolutely impossible to follow Mark Brown's slides during lecture. I used to take an average of 4 hours per slides presentation in order to have a good intuition about what was being taught (fully understand the slides is out of reach, at least for the mortals like me). It is no surprise that after the first two weeks only ten students were showing up to class. What I mean is that his slides are dense, and it takes time and patience in order to move through the material. Although there is a lot of proofs on them, you will not be asked to do any on the exams or homeworks. Your goal when reading the slides is to get the essentials about the material (ie the main formulas, underlying concepts, etc), not to fully understand each passage. Try to summarize the main points of each lecture after reading it. You will need that summary in order to study for the midterm and final. 
From my experience, I could understand reasonably well what was going on from lectures 1 to 8 (by studying the slides by myself, obviously. As I said, going to lectures is a waste of time). Those are the lectures that will be on the midterm. I did not read lectures 9 and 10 (they were dense examples above the material on lectures 1 to 8, kind of useless for the midterm, since the midterm exercises were a lot easier). I poorly understood lectures slides 11 to 20 (but still could get the main concepts and formulas) and I did even touch lecture slides 21 to 25.
Regarding homework, there will be 4. They will be a lot easier when compared to understanding the slides. You will basically need to know the main concepts and try to apply it. Still, the homeworks are a lot harder than midterm and final. If you can understand the homework problems, that's a good sign. It means you understand the key concepts of the class.
Now, the key to do well on the midterm and final is to have a good summary of the main concepts and formulas of the class. What you need to do in order to come up with a good summary is to understand the homework problems, understand the main ideas of lectures 1 to 8 and 11 to 20 and fully understand how to solve the practice midterm and final. The practice midterm and final probably taught me more than anything else in this class.
Finally, I got an A in this class, even without touching 7/25 lectures slides. I am not telling you to do the same, I am just saying that you do not need to freak out if you do not fully understand the lectures or if the material gets impenetrable after lecture 21. 

Workload:
The workload is average. Considering that you will spend an average of 4 hours reading the slides of each lecture in order to have a good intuition about the material, 8 hours per week is not that bad. There will be 4 homeworks, which will probably take from 6 to 12 hours each.

Each point is elucidated clearly and flows logically out of the previous point and into the next point, so that the listener is transported by the argument.  By the end of the lecture, a poem or poems have been unfolded for the listener, made more accessible, more meaningful, and more deeply moving.
Many people stand outside the door of the world of poetry, wishing to cross the threshold but unable to do so without guidance; Professor Gray opens the door and invites his students to enter.

Jae is one the worst professors I have ever had. He is discouraging his students by telling them that they are essentially losers for not remembering C code syntax. He has no new knowledge of the recent updates in the C and C++ language, which makes no sense as a computer science professor at an elite school. 
Jae teaches this class with the passion your dad has for reading you washing machine manual. He is boring and uses abstract class notes, while not following any reading order, just to confuse you even more.
He uses an old school teaching method where telling a student he sucks should motivate him or her to do better and try harder.
The grading system is unfair and discouraging. The exams are ridiculously hard and don't reflect in any way how much of a good programmer you are. The problems on the exam are tricky and concentrate on memorizing syntax and Linux command line outputs, also if you understand tricky instructions.
Jae exploits the fact CS students are obligated to take AP to demoralize students. With so many good CS professors that Columbia has to offer, it is a shame one has no choice but to take AP with Prof. Lee.

I'm struggling through Orgo II right now and I just want to take this moment to say that Cornish was actually not that horrible as people wrote on this page. I got an A- despite not doing that great throughout the term and probably doing wellish on the final. If I had been a little less careless on midterms 3/4, I might've gotten an A. Or maybe I wouldn't have since I wouldn't have put sufficient effort into the final. 
Yes: she's condescending, unclear about things, her lecturing is not terribly useful but also necessary to go to since she really doesn't follow McMurray that closely and disagrees with them. She goes off on unrelated tangents about her political perspectives, her thoughts on important social values, and seemingly contradictory thoughts on how hard we should work. You have to memorize pKAs and other details. In retrospect, I think the pKa's aren't that bad, especially since you have to cram a ton of reactions in anyway.
On the other hand, her lecturing is clear. She doesn't mumble, and you can actually understand whatever she's saying. Her exams follow the exact same template. You should never be pressed for time on her tests, since they're always 4 or 5 questions with multiple parts. She usually does a few theoretical-ish questions. She loves free energy diagrams, resonance, and usually for midterms 3 and 4, puts some more challenging mechanisms or syntheses that aren't that awful, but you have to think outside of the box for. If you ask her to clarify something in class, she will. She does care about whether the students are understanding the material or not. She repeated midterm 3 for our class, i.e. exact same material, because the average wasn't high enough and she also doesn't care about some concepts and she's pretty clear about that. 
And honestly, the fact that McMurray isn't her God is nice sometimes because the book is a bit confusing. If you want to study, focus on her problems and the old midterms. She also has some books that she really likes which you can check out if you're really keen. McMurray can also be ok. 
Honestly, I'm not an exceptional sciences student at Columbia and I cursed her every week of the term for all of her idiosyncrasies, but after sitting through 4 weeks of Doubleday, who basically doesn't curve, mumbles and laughs erratically, follows McMurray like it's the Bible, and is barely intelligible even in the 2nd row, I have gained a newfound respect for her.

The flow of conversation in the class often felt extremely unnatural, as she would call on people in a circle and occasionally interrupt with her own not particularly pertinent insight.

Prof. Wojczuk is amazing! If you care at all about reading and writing, you've struck gold by getting her. Ever class is tightly organized in order to maximize the effective of the lesson, and she chooses readings that actually keep you interested in the craft of writing and analyzing. The readings were lengthy, but almost always extremely enjoyable. Meeting with her one on one is even better than having class with her because she has an ability to grasp what you want to say in your piece before you fully grasp it. Your writing will improve in this course because she does not accept BS and cares deeply about writing as a high stakes craft with real life implications.

The prof: Weinstein is a solid professor and lecturer; he goes through his slides (which he also posts online) very thoroughly and gives clear explanations. He knows his stuff super well and tries very hard to impress upon the students why/how it's relevant to the world beyond Japan. He even brought in a Board Member of the Bank of Japan to speak with us, which was neat. And like the below reviews have mentioned, he's just an all-around endearing dude.
Difficulty: the material itself might not seem too complex or straining, but the exams can be tough. You need to have a thorough understanding of everything he covers in order to do well. If you're looking for an easy class to fulfill your Econ elective or Global Core, this is not it. But if you genuinely put in the effort, your grade will reflect it. Class ends up curving to a B/B+. You'll have an easier time if you have a stronger understanding of international & macro concepts though.
Overall, if you want to learn something outside of the norm and don't mind putting in some effort, no harm in taking this class.

This man doesn't deserve a gold nugget. He deserves his own special nugget category of the finest, rarest, most powerful metal in the world. This was one of the best classes I've ever taken at Columbia, and he was one of the most compelling professors I've ever had. I'm absolutely indifferent towards poetry, yet Erik Gray made me relish it in ways I never thought possible. He's excellent at making the poems you read not only accessible, but more importantly, relevant.
His lectures are incredible. While questions are limited to the last 10-15 minutes, his lectures are so good that I didn't even want any discussion because I just wanted to hear him speak. They're arranged so clearly that at the end, everything comes full circle and you see how every point he makes fit into each other. He doesn't waste a single word. He doesn't veer into ambiguous, abstract concepts, nor does he get caught up in the nitty gritty details. I have never been so mind-blown so repeatedly in a class but this one. He has such an impressive way of phrasing his points in such an unexpected but intuitive manner, that when you hear them you can't help but immediately go ""yes, I know exactly what you mean, I just didn't know how to put it into words"" i.e., his opening line about grandmas and sex. It's mentioned somewhere in Bwog, look it up. He's also hilarious, has great comedic timing, and his passion and enchantment with the Romantics is infectious. I looked forward to this class every single day.
I don't care what you study at this school, I don't care if you even go to this school; you need to trek up the 7 floors of Hamilton to listen to this man speak. Even for one lecture, because that's really all you need to get hooked. Erik Gray is indeed a god. I admit I totally sip the Kool-Aid, but that's because this Kool-Aid is probably the best and most justified Kool-Aid you'll ever drink at Columbia.
Workload:
Readings: Several poems are assigned for each class, but you only really need to do the ones he cover in class.
Midterm/Discussion Section (15%): I personally chose the midterm, which I preferred since that meant Gray himself graded my papers, rather than the TAs. Basically a shorter version of the final.
2 papers (30%, 35%): Not difficult, you can pick a topic he provides or your own.
Final (20%): IDs, passage analysis, essay drawing upon themes & works of various poets. Also not difficult if you've been going to class & paying attention (which for this class, is the default). IDs are only on poems he's gone over in class, and he always gives you line numbers during class anyway. For the latter 2 portions, you should have a good understanding of the main Romanticism themes, but again not difficult to remember if you've been paying attention.

DO. NOT. TAKE. THIS. CLASS. 
I know that this is only the first year that this class has been held, but Professor Adams is truly problematic. She teaches the class in conjunction with a Dean, who is very nice, but they are obviously unorganized. They both come into class and use the first ten minutes to discuss the format of the class for the day. Why they could not have sat down for 10 minutes sometime during the week to figure that out is beyond me. 
Also, the readings are incredibly long and boring, we barely talk about them at all, and we aren't even tested on them. We also have essentially zero guidelines for grading, and we have to write short papers each week (that are pretty stupid, honestly) that are graded harshly by both professors. 
Adams is also just mean spirited. I was sick one day and didn't want to attend our volunteer day, and she e-mailed me claiming ""I just saw you on broadway with your friends....I am glad that you are feeling better."" Even if I was on Broadway, that was rude. I could have been at Duane Reade or something and she could have given me the benefit of the doubt. Regardless, there is no need to defend my whereabouts, because that was truly just one of the most passive aggressive and rude e-mails I have ever gotten.

Casey Blake deserves a good and recent review, so I'll offer one now. 
Prof. Blake is outstanding. He's not particularly funny (until you get to know him); he doesn't go for cute effects or snarky commentary. Instead, he pretty much stands at his lectern, looks out at the class, and lectures. But if you're serious about your intellectual and academic pursuits, if you care not only about what you're doing but also about what you're thinking, and how, and why, Prof. Blake is the man for you.
He's wildly smart; he's articulate; he's kind and caring. His lectures are well-organized (he projects an outline overhead), and if you've done the reading, easy to follow. His reading assignments (for both Intellectual History and Am. Cultural Criticism) are perfectly reasonable in page numbers--maybe even on the light side for a history class--though they tend to be dense and intellectually challenging, so they take a while. If you commit to doing the readings before class and to giving them the attention that they deserve, the lectures are interesting, the discussion sections are engaging, and the exams are reasonable. His papers are certainly challenging, but only because they require you to totally understand the material and to think creatively and analytically about it.
Prof. Blake takes his classes very seriously, and he expects you to do the same. Food, computers, phones, and tardiness are prohibited. He demands good, clear writing and doesn't put up with empty thoughts papered over with 7-syllable words.
In office hours, he is thoughtful and generous. He wants to get to know you and to hear what you're thinking and reading about, so go talk to him! It's not every day that you find a professor at the fore of his field who's willing to take your thoughts so seriously. True, he's a little awkward--be willing to wade through that. It's worth it.
A note about US intellectual history: it's essentially a class on the ideas that have been prevalent at different times in US history; it's about the way that people have thought about culture and politics at different moments in time. If you're looking for a class in which to learn about what war we fought when, this is not the one. But if you're looking to understand where today's ideas come from, if you're looking for ways to think about the world around, if you're looking for the company of brilliant thinkers, this is TOTALLY the class for you.

I have never written a CULPA review before, but I was just looking through reviews of professors I have had out of curiosity and I am so surprised by all of the negative reviews for Dr. Metcalfe. I'm not sure if other people have given spiteful reviews or if things have improved a lot since 2014, but I loved Dr. Metcalfe's class. In fact, I don't think I heard anyone in my class last semester (fall 2016) express that they thought anything about Memory & Stress was unfair. Study guides given out encompass everything you need to know, lectures are interesting, and Dr. Metcalfe is very sweet! I don't mean to call anyone else's reviews into question, but it is very difficult for me to picture her being condescending or rude to students. I would strongly recommend this class. It is important to be aware going into it that some material presented only in lecture (and not available in readings) will be on tests, so it is important to either consistently attend class & take detailed notes, or otherwise attend review sessions & ask TAs about concepts you missed. You will know in advance which class concepts will be on the test, since this is all outlined in study guides.

In fact, in my opinion, the final was by far the easiest test of the semester. Not only had we already been tested on everything it asked, but it also focused on the most central/prominent/memorable course concepts, and generally did not ask for as much detailed information as the midterms.

This was by far my favorite class at Columbia. It was an 8:40 which was unfortunate, but Xavier's lectures were so riveting that I wouldn't actually mind going to class. And I knew I wasn't alone in this, as the lecture room was nearly full every morning. Essentially this course explores the question ""why are some countries poor?"" The class is a mix of theory, models and mathematics, and Xavier blends the three elements together as if telling a semester long economic narrative, rather than lecturing at you. The math involved isn't particularly terrifying for an upper level economics class- the most complicated it gets is Lagrangian, but it's basically applied in a manner that is no more difficult than it was in micro. I think the most compelling thing about this class was the way in which math was used to help tell the story of economic development. You don't feel like you are learning abstract and pointless graphs and equations, but rather real-life solutions. 
Also, Xavier is basically the best human being. A funny, passionate, quirky Spanish guy, he explains complex concepts in a simplified yet elegant way. He matches his brightly colored suit jacket to his power point every day, calls Trump our ""funny orange man"" and uses the game of soccer to explain the concept of idea innovation. It really doesn't get better. And he is very approachable and loves questions. I seriously encourage all undergraduates to take this class. It makes economics relevant, inspiring and challenges you without being overwhelming you.
Now, I am a bit biased because development economics is my area of interest. But I will say that a large reason as to why I have taken an interest to that field is because of the some of the things I was exposed to in this class. So take that for what it's worth.

This class is damaging to the nature of an academic institution. The professor starts with a singular thesis: America is a terrible nation of a privileged class that has wreaked havoc on the world, and presents each case to support this idea. In class, he said the following: “I do not accept that America is a legitimate nation… I’ve looked at the documents… there is nothing there.” After Trump was elected he told the class, “Just so you know, the way I’m approaching this… is that I’m not going to accept anything this man says or does as legitimate.” To have this man at the front of a classroom undermines the value of reason, critical thinking, and sound argumentation. If the Right wanted the shining example to criticize how academic institutions have leaned towards a moral fascism and no longer represent liberal values, this would be it. Any dissenting opinion was shut down by cries of privilege. There was absolutely no critical thinking or marshaling of facts or evidence that went on. 
This class is popular because you legitimately do not have to think to get an A. If you repeat the thesis over and over again that America is not actually exceptional because it has harmed certain people and certain nations, you get an A. This is the type of class that silences anyone with a dissenting opinion or factual argument. This is the type of class that makes students scared to speak out because they are afraid they will be labeled a racist, sexist, etc. This review is not at all out of malice towards the professor - he has strong ideological values that should be harnessed in political action. His passion and bias prevent him from facilitating any productive learning in the classroom but could be very useful in other realms. 
I truly hope that Barnard will not keep this professor on just because students like his class because it requires no thinking and makes them feel like their opinions are moral. This is not the direction universities should be going in.

I had a really tough time with this class and decided Barnard was a better choice. It was just weird, and very tricky. Barnard is a traditional biology class, straightforward and organized from basics to advanced material. We learned about anatomy which I enjoyed.I took biochem separately as is required by many medical school admission committees.  My study time as full time student was manageable and I was able to explore opportunities at the medical campus. I don't believe that I would have had as much time for that if I contributed with mowshowits as a full time student. I did well on my MCAT and have been accepted to multiple medical schools including highly ranked ones here in NY. Maybe if you are a postbacc and have time for it you will like it but I'm glad I switched.

I took this class spring 2015. A wonderful professor that engages the class well. Jokes and witty observations abound. Incredibly manageable workload and solicits participation well for a large lecture (about 60 students). Topics included gender and family in dynastic China, the Republic, Mao and the present. Focus on the intellectual underpinnings of gender and family and their transformations, particularly in the later half of the class as China moves to ""modernize"" (scarequotes should be much, much larger). A bit of an anthropological bent as the course approached topics in the modern and present eras. Papers were short (about two pages) but to do well you often needed to write three or even four pages. Final paper (no exam) was 10 to 12 pages, no outside research necessary. A TA grades your work occasionally but I never spoke to her, ever. 
A great class if you're an underclassman looking for a gentle introduction to history and history writing, given the fact that there was no outside research component (all papers were based solely on the readings and lectures). Interestingly, the class was practically all women save for a handful of men, of which I was one. I heartily recommend this course to men, if only because the professor is so engaging, and because it counts as a breadth course if you're specializing in Europe or the Americas (this is certainly one of the better breadth courses) (not to mention that an analysis of gender is always useful for your own life).

Art Hum with Dr. Delbanco was an incredibly worthwhile experience. Her teaching style is mostly lecturing, while encouraging frequent student participation. She led us on 2 trips to the Met and 1 trip to the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. She is ABSOLUTELY brilliant, and her interpretations of certain pieces just blew my mind. I entered Art Hum with a pretty good basic knowledge of art, and was immediately humbled by the skill with which she was able to interpret. When I went to museums towards the end of the course, I was able to see things I never would have noticed before, and have a great newfound appreciation for the works. Prof Delbanco is very analytical, and is not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom. Although we did not cover as many works as some of the other sections, we really delved into the ones we did look at, and really built up skills of interpretation that can be applied to many pieces. She does expect a lot in the papers, although they are each fairly short. You have to be crystal clear in your interpretations, and not leave any major details out, so I'd definitely suggest meeting with her in office hours before each paper where she is incredibly helpful.  Her exams are straightforward if you remember what she says in class and read her comments on your papers. This was a very enjoyable class.

Professor Hansen taught me to see math very differently. He has a lot of energy to teach the class. He's young, that is probably why. A lot of my classmates came to class because his energy drew them back (or because they fawned over him). I personally think I am prepared to take modern analysis if I do go that route and I think it should be easy since I scanned through the Rudin book and I feel I've learned most of it through this class. He has a lot of office hours and can really help guide you if you're stuck. From what I've heard from other students you can stop by his office and ask questions if he's there outside of his office hours.
If you want to learn calculus in a different way and need to take analysis later, this class will prepare you, and Professor Hansen is great to take it from. If you have to get your Calculus requirements out of the way and don't really care how you do it, then this class may be a big challenge for you.

Lucie's class was solid. We were given very clear and easily-digestible summaries of every genre and music era that we had to know. Every lecture focused on samples of particular genres, and we were given some short readings and listenings before each class. Because of this, the class was straightforward.
There's a pretty level playing field for all students to get good grades in the class, regardless of how much musical experience they had in the past. It might take some outside practice to understand the music terminology at the beginning of the semester, but later on all the same music theory terms are circulated around during discussions.
Overall, we learned a lot about motivations behind music characteristics, and discussions that surrounded a particular music genre. We also tied in these music genres to current interpretations (i.e. live performances with Q&As, seminars) that all helped in understanding the material better. The workload was not heavy.

Jae Lee is a terrible professor. I wouldn't even want him as a TA for this class. 
His two main objectives are: Make blisteringly difficult homeworks and tests, and catch cheaters. 
You will hear him talk about cheating in almost every lecture. It's his favorite subject. He sent out several unprofessional emails to the class ranting and raving about cheating, including one where he called cheaters ""douchebags"". At the end of the semester, maybe three weeks before the final, he sent out a threatening email to those he suspected of cheating saying they had until the next morning to reply as to whether or not they cheated and the first word of their email had to be yes or no. If they said no there would be a formal investigation and the consequences would be much worse than if they just admitted cheating. He sent this email on a Friday night, where no one would be at the school to advocate for, or give advice to the students who received the email. I had some friends get the email, who didn't think they had cheated, but because of the threatening nature of the email, they didn't know what to do. Some of the cheating accusations came from homework assigned toward the beginning of the semester. So he waited until just before the final, when stress was highest, and sent a threatening email forcing students to incriminate themselves, or else. 
One student gave him a doctor's note because they were sick during a test. He didn't believe them, and passed their note around to the TAs. There is no reason for him to share someone's medical information with TAs. 
The tests were ridiculous. He gives you tests from past semesters to study from, but all they will do is show you that your test will be just as impossible as those were. The averages were low, something under 50 for the midterms, I believe. This is the only class I've ever had where I felt like I wasted time by studying. I don't care if I get a B+, if you give me a test where I get 40/100, I'm going to feel stressed and deflated. 
The homework was insanely difficult and time consuming. If you have a ton of experience programming, far beyond Intro to Java and Data Structures, it might not be so difficult, but it will be time consuming. Think 20-30 hours per assignment toward the end. 
This listserv for this class is annoying. You get dozens and dozens of emails a day. It's not well organized. 
This has the opportunity to be a great class. Knowing C and C++ is very valuable. This class should not be taught by Jae Lee. No class that is required for a major should be taught by this man. People should be able to choose whether or not they want to subject themselves to his teaching. It blows my mind that he has good reviews on here. I feel like I'm looking at a conservative's Facebook page filled with pro Trump propaganda. The only reason I can think for this is that you've never felt relief like being done with this class. If you struggled through like most of us, you'll probably never want to think about AP again, let alone write something about it.

Professor Lurie is and will continue to be amazing. He was one of the best professors that I had the pleasure of taking at Columbia. His knowledge of everything Japanese was vast and very impressive. I had the opportunity to take both his survey course on Japan and a seminar on myths of East Asia. Honestly, both classes did not feel like work, especially in the seminar. Lurie's personality made me feel quite at ease and the lectures and discussions were enjoyable, entertaining, and very educational. I would recommend to go to his office hours and just talk story with the guy, he is very friendly and a blast to get to know, as well as truly wanting all of his students to succeed both inside and outside the classroom. I would wholeheartedly recommend anyone to take a class with David Lurie, I promise you will not regret it.

Mythology of East Asia- I had the experimental class as it was his first time putting the class together. Class had primary texts and secondary readings. The readings for the class were fairly manageable and at times did not even feel like work, though at times I felt that some of the secondary readings could have been modified, but it was the initial class. One midterm paper, one research paper and a presentation on one of the secondary readings. Overall a standard seminar, but the subject matter was a blast!

She does a great job of choosing a variety of materials in order to engage everyone in the class. The topics covered span from psychology and neuroscience to literature and film, so the class was able to touch on everyone's strengths. Ellen is a very fair grader and always gives great, straightforward feedback. She facilitates interesting discussions in class, and people were eager to participate. Attending this class was an absolute joy. Ellen also really cares about her students and their lives outside of class, and gave a couple of paper extensions during stressful parts of the semester. She is a fantastic woman. Long story short: take this class!! It has been my favorite class here so far!

Casey Blake deserves a good and recent review, so I'll offer one now. 
Prof. Blake is outstanding. He's not particularly funny (until you get to know him); he doesn't go for cute effects or snarky commentary. Instead, he pretty much stands at his lectern, looks out at the class, and lectures. But if you're serious about your intellectual and academic pursuits, if you care not only about what you're doing but also about what you're thinking, and how, and why, Prof. Blake is the man for you.
He's wildly smart; he's articulate; he's kind and caring. His lectures are well-organized (he projects an outline overhead), and if you've done the reading, easy to follow. His reading assignments (for both Intellectual History and Am. Cultural Criticism) are perfectly reasonable in page numbers--maybe even on the light side for a history class--though they tend to be dense and intellectually challenging, so they take a while. If you commit to doing the readings before class and to giving them the attention that they deserve, the lectures are interesting, the discussion sections are engaging, and the exams are reasonable. His papers are certainly challenging, but only because they require you to totally understand the material and to think creatively and analytically about it.
Prof. Blake takes his classes very seriously, and he expects you to do the same. Food, computers, phones, and tardiness are prohibited. He demands good, clear writing and doesn't put up with empty thoughts papered over with 7-syllable words.
In office hours, he is thoughtful and generous. He wants to get to know you and to hear what you're thinking and reading about, so go talk to him! It's not every day that you find a professor at the fore of his field who's willing to take your thoughts so seriously. True, he's a little awkward--be willing to wade through that. It's worth it.
A note about US intellectual history: it's essentially a class on the ideas that have been prevalent at different times in US history; it's about the way that people have thought about culture and politics at different moments in time. If you're looking for a class in which to learn about what war we fought when, this is not the one. But if you're looking to understand where today's ideas come from, if you're looking for ways to think about the world around, if you're looking for the company of brilliant thinkers, this is TOTALLY the class for you.

Janna Levin is narcissistic, self-obsessed, and arrogant. She constantly talks about herself...literally constantly. I don't need to hear 10 billion times that she gave a TED talk, ect. And you know she loves hearing herself talk. She repeatedly attempts to reaffirm that she's the smartest person in the room...I swear sometimes she would intentionally use big words in an attempt to sound smart/belittle you, but honestly it was just annoying. She expects everyone to be obsessed with her and she picks obvious favorites. She holds it against you if you don't constantly tell her how awesome, smart, inspiring she is. It's ironic that she's an astrophysicist because she believes the world (and probably the sun for that matter) revolves around her and only her.

If you happen to get bad Teaching fellow you're screwed, however professor Nathan is great and even changed one of my grades when I disagreed with a bad Teaching fellow.

Nathan himself is a great professor, write down everything he says for the midterm and final and do not miss class. He clearly enjoys and engages with the material and although class is a bit boring, it feels purposeful for the exams. Do not do the readings they are a waste of time.

By FAR the best teacher I have ever had. Consider yourself privileged if you end up with Anton as your professor. He completely changed my view on Mathematics, taking it from a ""meh"" subject to something I really enjoy. To put it this way, there is a reason why half of the class changed to Math majors after taking him. He is one of the few people that truly takes pride into whether you grasp a concept or not, and he will go through as many examples as it takes for the entire class to understand it. He doesn't waste his time to derive a million formulas like most math teachers, instead he really emphasis on making each concept as simple and obtainable as possible for everyone. 
He puts in a 10min break halfway through the class so that you can collect your thoughts. This really helps when you go through a lot of concepts and need to re-establish your focus.
Make sure you do all the homework problems he gives out and you will be more than fine, and it will give you a really good foundation for higher classes in Math!
Sidenote: He knows a lot of Math history as well, so he will describe once in a while for example how ancient civilizations for the first time came up with a method to solve problems that we today consider very stupid. Expect some good laughs in his class!

I took Phillip's Organic Chemistry I class in Fall 2016, and I am currently in her Organic Chemistry II class for Spring 2017. To be transparent, I did very well in her class first semester and am expecting to do well again this coming semester.
While I'll admit that I do come from a strong chemistry background, I thought that Professor Phillips was very fair. If you take good notes in class, and you make sure you fully understand the workshops that she hands out in class, you can do well. You don't need to read the textbook. She has optional workshop sessions on Fridays, where everyone does the workshop problems in groups and then the groups present the answers. They can be helpful if you go, but if you can't go, it's also perfectly fine to get the answers from a classmate or ask your TA about questions during recitation. Her tests are straightforward, and her questions always come straight from things that she discussed in class or things on the workshop.
I think a lot of the bitterness around her class has come from a grading scale that she posted during our first semester. While the class is not curved, the difficult grading scale is not specific to her class. The chemistry department has a very strict grading policy so that only a specific percentage of the class get A's, B's, and C's. The average for her exams consistently falls around a 70%, which according to the cutoffs she published, is a C+/B-. And that does not take into account the fact that you can drop an entire exam so her overall final grades should have an even higher average. Overall, I thought that her grading scale was fair for an organic chemistry class. After all, organic chemistry is a difficult subject, so it should not be expected that Professor Phillips just hand out A's just because her class is filled with pre-med students.
All in all, a fair class. You will do well if you put in the effort.

pretty easy and laid back class
he literally makes attendance for non-debate days optional, though i highly suggest going because he spills most of the info that is relevant on the midterm/final in class.  the readings aren't super heavy (i did half a semesters worth the night before the exam)  the policy brief is somewhat daunting but i managed to get an A- despite putting in little effort.  great for fulfilling the upper level econ elective requirement at brand during a semester when you have heavy obligations in other areas (like my lovely econometrics class).  reback is pretty chill and very approachable. you probably won't leave this class with a deep understanding of the american public school system, but you will learn a decent amount of background

Ellen is one of the most wonderful professors I have met so far at Barnard. Taking this class during my first semester of college was a fantastic decision to make, since Ellen is incredibly encouraging, so participating in class discussions was never daunting (unlike some of the other classes I have since taken). She sometimes directs the conversation to certain people if they haven't said anything yet but is never too pushy, and also told us at the beginning of the semester that if we found it difficult to speak in class to talk to her privately so that she can work with us individually and perhaps make some accommodations for our participation grade. Additionally, her anecdotes can be really funny, and she brings a really positive vibe to the classroom. 
Some readings can be incredibly long and heavy, as another review mentioned, but as long as you read enough of it to make some insightful comments in class and pay attention to the discussion, you should be fine. During one-on-one meetings, Ellen was always very helpful and made very specific suggested improvements, which certainly helped me to improve the quality of my papers and writing in general. I highly recommend this class!

This was one of the easiest classes I have ever taken. That being said, Professor Jhanwar is very sweet and creates very straightforward PowerPoints that you can turn into flashcards for studying purposes. I rented the textbook but never even opened it, since all the material covered on the tests are in the PowerPoints - I found it helpful to attend lecture and did not have to study very much because I paid attention in class. All the exams are multiple choice with VERY brief short-answer questions at the end and non-cumulative. Personally enjoyed the material, but had covered a lot of it from IB SL psych. She is always willing to patiently answer questions (even the dumb ones) and lectures rarely ran for the full 75 minutes. Would recommend if looking to knock out a requirement or for an elective GPA booster.

I love Professor Agueros and I love this class. I'm a Barnard psych major taking astronomy to fulfill my outside science, and the kid inside me that loved learning about the solar system in elementary school is completely satisfied. Professor Agueros is really engaging and thoughtful. His lectures remind me a bit of high school courses: he encourages questions, takes time to explain things repeatedly, and uses real-world examples to get his points across. He does a lot of think-pair-share/vote-think-pair-share activities where you consult your neighbor to answer a specific question, and he also loves assigning lecture tutorials, where you spend a portion of class working with a partner to answer a worksheet. He carries the partner theme onto the actual exams: you take the exam individually, turn it in, then take the exact same exam with a partner. The grades are averaged if they help you, and the partner exam is ignored if it hurts you. It's a really nice, albeit strange, grading style. My only gripe is that there was no syllabus until halfway through the semester.

The class itself was good. For starters, Baswell gives you a really comprehensive look at the Tales by offering a lot of supplementary material to enrich your understanding, including handouts on Middle English pronunciation and links to websites with linguistic and audio resources. I was enamored with his lectures - never reductive, as they relate the rhetorical structure and other formal aspects of the Tales to its substantive content, and weave in a lot of literary theory and historical context.
That being said, I'm genuinely surprised, judging from the reviews below, that other people have had positive experiences with him as a person. To me, he was elitist, misogynist, and xenophobic. These are some instances of what happened:
1) We went over my final exam in his office hours, during which he asked, ""Is English your second language?"" I said no (it technically is, as I'm first-gen American, something about which I've felt acutely self-conscious at this institution); he responded, ""Oh, so did you go to public school then?"" It's really quite incredulous and inexcusable. Both ethnic and class condescension, in one? Really? My final grade was a B+, which - considering the standards to which he holds his students - isn't a bad grade; I'm proud of it. Accordingly, there's literally nothing that could have warranted those comments, other than a desire to be cruel via repulsive and antiquated prejudices. (Not to say that getting a bad grade could have justified those comments, because all in all he was really unprofessional. He's intelligent. If he had wanted to provide constructive critique, there would have been many ways to go about it.)
2) Unlike my final, my midterm hadn't gone so well, and he was keen to remind me. When I was scheduling my appointment for a Middle English pronunciation exercise, he said, ""it's ungraded, I might add."" (He hadn't reminded other students of that.) So it appears the man is as adept at being passive-aggressive as he is at being blunt.
3) A semester later, I stopped by his office hours for advice on my senior thesis, a portion of which concerned the Tales. (Possibly I thought to use him as a resource out of some masochistic urge, I don't know.) He dismissed my idea (""sometimes a cigar is just a cigar""), urged me to ""think about it more"" (I'd brought a large binder with heaps of research), and - when another student walked in - ushered her inside and kicked me out. Can you believe this man is a professor, in charge of cultivating the intellect of young adults at a generally insecure and transitional period in their lives?
4) He told me I was ""interesting,"" and that Barnard tends to admit more ""interesting"" students than CC because of a ""more holistic and less rote admissions process,"" and, in this way, ""Barnard is analogous to GS."" Then: ""The problem is that sometimes they admit students who can't meet the institution's standards."" Again: my class grade was a B+, which clearly meets the standards; also, this man is a BARNARD PROFESSOR. Add ironic, self-defeating misogynistic condescension to the list of his wonderful traits.
I was so rattled by all this - mostly instance #1 - that I considered, and am still considering, going to my class dean. I'm not sure what about me provoked him, but something did, and I'm inclined to think that people like him don't have just one target. Is it possible his personality has changed so much from the years in which previous reviews were written? Because I do recommend the class - it was quite good - but I also recommend keeping your distance from him, and not expecting too much of him as a professor. He was generally unavailable in office hours (showed up late to appointments, and a couple of times not at all, without notice). I understand that he might be going through difficult things, but that doesn't give him license to renege on his job, ethically or otherwise.

Professor Rashid is extraordinarily engaging and entertaining. This was by far my favorite class this semester at Columbia. 
There is a -huge- social justice element to this class, and much of the vocabulary that you learn is such. If you are good at analysis you do not need to worry too much about in-class notes, though I took them extensively simply because I really genuinely enjoyed what I was learning. 
It is is structured around recent events, so it will largely depend on what is going on in the world at the time. Professor Rashid tries to bring in one relevant piece of news, music, or pop culture reference to each class. 
A few of the readings are comic books, and fiction novels such as The Lion, The Witch & The Wardrobe.

I disagree with what other people have said here. I found Prof Carlebach's lectures to be a solid 'meh'. The earlier lectures were interesting, but only got drier as the semester progressed. The amount of reading was manageable, but varied significantly in relevance and interest. The discussion sections were awkward and  quiet. The grading of the exams and papers was pretty harsh, especially for a global core. Not to say global cores should be easy, but this class was less accessible to non-history students than it could have been. 
For the midterm and final (non-cumulative) we had 25-30 readings and a dozen or so primary sources we were responsible for. Each exam was 8 questions of which we chose 7. For every point made in each short answer question (ie. every fact, person, event mentioned) we had to cite both the reading and the author it came from. Memorizing the names of each reading, their authors, and the relevant facts from each (rather than just learning the actual material) made studying for these exams way more tedious than necessary, while contributing nothing to what you might actually be learning. Also, doing all this will not guarantee a decent grade, only that you don't fail.
Overall this is a fine course to take if you really need to fill a 4-credit global core requirement, or you are genuinely interested in the material. Many people clearly enjoyed the class. However, the ratio of workload to amount learned is pretty bad. You could learn most of the material from the course during an afternoon's Wikipedia binge.

Although incredibly nice and accessible, this class was a huge disappointment. Vrinda doesn't encourage discussion in any way although she likes to act like she does; she often imposes her interpretations of literary works on the class and dismisses other ideas if they don't exactly match what she's thinking of. We haven't had one in depth discussion all year, perhaps she'd be better as a lecturer but for a small 12 person class this really isn't enjoyable (an hour of her asking questions, ignoring the answers we give, and saying her own answer out loud gets a little monotonous). 
 For essays: Prepare to have her give you her ideas on what you're trying to say as opposed  to actually attempting to understand what you're writing about and guiding you in the right direction. She turns writing into a formulaic task, with hundreds of worksheets you'll fill out but never use again, and incredibly inflexible ideas about what an essay has to be. In my opinion, she teaches you to follow a formula of the essays she enjoys rather than actually providing you with tools to write original essays for a variety of classes. Meeting with her also isn't helpful, as she doesn't even look at your draft before giving you her own opinions and pushing you towards them or making you do activities like free writes and worksheets (in an hour long meeting) and then not giving you any helpful advice aside from writing down her own ideas for you to later regurgitate in an essay.
She also made us buy an $80 book pack (5 books) from book culture and a course reader from village copier from which we've read two books and less than half of the reader.

Not only has she proven incredibly ignorant in a number of situations, the actual lectures are convoluted and confusing at best, at worst she makes up her own terms for things and seems to even confuse herself, often changing what she's saying in the middle of a sentence and rambling on about irrelevant things that not even the TAs seem to comprehend.  She often neglects to speak in proper, coherent sentences.  I learned more from the TA lead discussion sections than from the actual lecture.

The bad:  the homework requirements are left with intentional vagueness.  It wasn't until midway through the semester that it was clarified that this was by design and that Steve's philosophy is that in the real world there is ambiguity, so programmers will be expected to apply their own judgment in assumptions when writing a program.  Having worked in cyber security, I don't totally agree... but that being said, it's good to know upfront that you have a lot of latitude in defining the requirements so long as you document your decisions in your readme.
The assignments themselves were time consuming, although not necessarily hard.  The thought process is different than most other programming classes: you can't merely write a program to fulfill an outcome, and have to consider how the program can be exploited by attackers.  Your goal in writing is to consider the flaws and add robustness to reduce exploit vectors.
The midterm and final were open notes/open book and scenario based, so it wasn't a matter of regurgitating material as you had to consider circumstances and apply what was covered in lecture.  More CS courses should adopt this format.    
The lectures were fantastic, and kept pace with real world developments in security.  The class was at a particularly interesting time late in the 2016 election season when there was a lot of pub about Hillary Clinton's E-mail server and the hacking of the DNC E-mails.

This is a new class that Monica Cohen is offering. I took the class because i have taken her Austen, Brontë, Gaskell class before and loved it. Cohen is a great professor, she has deep insight on the books and makes the class accessible to all the students, even those, like myself, who are not english majors. She will meet with you outside of class and is very helpful in office hours. In general she is a wonderful person who cares about her students and about the works she teaches. She listens to what everyone has to say and is sometimes too considerate. She will not cut students off, even if they go on irrelevant tangents. I will say that this class sometimes felt like a book club but I attribute that to the fact that this was the first time she taught it. In her other classes, the discussion was much more elevated, insightful and organized. I would recommend taking this class if you want to read historical novels and have an insightful discussion about them. But this was not a challenging class in any way. 
Here is the list of novels:  Jane Austen, Persuasion; Charlotte Brontë, Shirley; Charles Dickens, Tale of Two Cities; George Eliot, Scenes of Clerical Life; Elizabeth Gaskell, Mary Barton; Thomas Hardy, Mayor of Casterbridge; Walter Scott, Heart of Midlothian.
Overall, I would recommend this class because I think it can only get better over the years. Professor Cohen is a sweetheart and ultimately this is an enjoyable class.
Workload:
There is a lot of reading given that you have to read  6 or 7 novels throughout the semester. We usually tackle a new one every two weeks. Some of the works are very long (The Heart of Midlothian, Scott) and some are very short (Tale of Two Cities). There is a mid-term essay (5-8pages and a final essay (8-10 pages). She will help you with topics and will go over your introduction and outline with you in office hours if you ask.

Do not take this class with Robban Toleno to fulfill your global core requirement. He is a new teacher at Columbia (having previously taught at UBC) and it shows. 
His exams are frustratingly stupid - he loves tricky T/F questions that are completely true save one word, or he loves asking you T/F questions on things he mentions in passing in class. He also loves fill in the blank questions where you have to memorize over a dozen tricky Sanskrit buddha names instead of actually learning religious ideas/concepts. He doesn't post any lectures and takes attendance so you have to go to every class. He also loves testing you on little details that will appear briefly on one slide but will most definitely be on a T/F question. He sucks at curving (curved our first quiz to a C+). 
Also, he is just a terrible professor with an even worse attitude. After realizing that the entire class was unhappy with his testing style, he asked the class for feedback one day, during which he literally threw a tantrum, started trash talking a girl after she left the room, and disagreed with every piece of feedback he got.

Tom is an amazing professor and an amazing person. I am so happy I got to take Music Hum with him as I don't think I would've learned as much or enjoyed it as much with anyone else. 

First of all this man is an angel. He is just like a really precious kind person. He also LOVES music. There's nothing like taking a class with someone who is actually passionate about the subject matter. He makes the class accessible for people who know nothing about music. We also went beyond the music and talked about the historical and contemporary critiques of composers and their works which I thought added something really valuable that went beyond just passing a core.
Additionally, this is not a class that you will need to stress about. He respects the fact that it's a core class that not everyone may be into by giving an extremely manageable workload. He also reads essay drafts, holds test review sessions, and is really available for questions showing that he puts in the extra effort.
He also used Beyonce to demonstrate a musical principle in class like what more could you want???

Awesome professor! Course grade is purely based on midterm and final. Homework is assigned but not graded He posts lecture slides for reading, but will actually lecture on the board though. Goes through the material in a very clear manner and explains everything. He actually works really hard outside of the class to make sure he covers all of the points necessary. Compared to Martha Kim, he will cover and emphasize more of the theoretical concepts of computer systems which gives you a much better understanding than just doing four/five projects in Kim's course. If you don't care about learning the material and would rather just read it on your own, take it with Martha Kim. If you would like a great lecturer, take it with Rubenstein!

All I can say is...eh.
Her class isn't a *terrible* way to get the final part of your language requirement done. That being said, you'll have to trudge through her class three days a week for a whole semester. All in all, ""Loli"" is a really nice person. She's friendly before, during, and after class. I just take issue with the way she teaches: it seems disorganized, and we spend an inordinate amount of time on things that seem trivial (and make up little of the tests and quizzes) but very little time on the challenging, important stuff (e.g. we learned 4 new verb tenses in one day, and didn't review them after that. But the next two classes, we did learn how to say drill, and hammer, and needle! Useful...). 
If you're willing to review all the important stuff on your own (and do it almost daily), you'll be fine. I wasn't willing. I let this class take a backseat to the others I was taking because there isn't a ton of work besides the midterm and final. But come the big tests, if you weren't reviewing without being told to do so, you're going to have a very hard time, like I did. I guess this is inherent to most language classes, but, again, the work you are assigned mostly focuses on stuff you are tested very little on, while there is often an entire section of the test on something we spent a day or two on. 
tl;dr she's a nice lady and makes good jokes during class, but has no idea how to convey what's important and what isn't or how to assign work based on that. I would say: avoid, and take Reyes' class if possible.

She is very passionate about the subject.  She was always happy and energetic in class.  However, I am pretty much tone deaf, and for me the class was a challenge.  She breezes by topics and facts very fast--and I think others in my class would agree--so for me it became a hard class.  I probably did the worst out of my group.  The average was a A- and I got a B.  She is extremely rule-bound, so if, let's say, you're at an A- but always participate and show interest, then she will give you an A- because your percentage warrants an A- only.  Not saying she shouldn't be this way, but there was a professional recording artist in my class who did everything and beyond and still got an A- in the end. 
There was a problematic lecture where she showed some movie where the protagonist is in black face.  The closest thing to a black person they had in there was me, and im not even black; i mean more in terms of having an awareness of systematic oppression of people of color.  So essentially no black people in the class.  She said that black face is controversial but that's as far as it went.  I had to raise my hand and comment on it further, to bring the point home.  She did not seem to be comfortable with that.  If you're going to show a film with black face, you gotta at least mention the history and problem associated with it.  To her, it didn't seem to be too big of a deal.  She might wanna reconsider showing that movie in her classes.

She gives detailed feedback on assignments and drafts leading up to the papers. She even provided audio feedback on some of our rough drafts, which turned out to be tremendously helpful when writing the final paper. Some of the writing assignments for each paper felt a bit unnecessary, but if taken seriously can be helpful in the long run. Grading was fair and her comments were helpful for future drafts. In short, she's fantastic and remains one of the better professors I've had here thus far.

Although the reviews made me a little scared to take this class, along with the anxiety-ridden experience I had in Gen Chem lab. But this lab has been wonderful, albeit not completely free of anxiety (will chemistry ever be, though?) The class overall has been really engaging, fun, and cool! I love all the experiments. Of course, sometimes you feel lost in lab and are so worried because you got only a spec of product back while everyone else got a gram or more. But don't worry! If you take the time to understand the theory, which isn't too hard to do with office hours EVERY DAY, they don't care that your results weren't perfect. I once got a percent recovery of 0.11% while the average among my friends was probably 20-40% and I didn't lose a single point for that as I explained what I thought happened. Again, if you don't know what happened go to office hours and they will help you brainstorm ideas. I find the grading to be extremely fair and not that difficult at all. If you explain the theory well and include the components listed in the lab manual you are almost guaranteed a 90% or higher. I am currently studying for the final in the class, which they have set us up to succeed on, with the helpful practice questions in the manual and the practice test, along with review sessions and again, office hours every day!
As for Dr. Rao herself, she is a pleasant, helpful, smart professor. I never found her to have favorites or be rude as others have suggested. She even answers questions by email if you are in a pinch. She gives an excellent pre-lab lecture. She may be a bit strict in lab, but that is only if you are not following basic safety rules, which are obviously important. 
My main message: don't be scared. I think a lot of people have an inferiority complex when it comes to the chem sequence but you can do it. Don't give into the culture of ""lab is the worst, chemistry is the worst, this is too hard, I just won't try,"" because it isn't that bad and you have all the support you need to succeed.

Professor Brown seems like a nice man with good intentions, but I wouldn't advise taking a class with him if you'd like to actually learn the material. He posts handwritten notes on courseworks and reads from them as they are projected on a screen in class... this is how he teaches math problems. To make matters worse his handwriting is hard to read at times. However, it is definitely possible to get a decent grade from the class. I did not do well on the midterm and did even worse on the final, but somehow received a good grade. So this means that pretty much everyone in the class had no idea what they were doing.

This looks like the first review in quite a while... some things are the same, some different.  I first wanna say that Indo-Tibetan Buddhism has so far been the greatest class I've taken at Columbia. Thurman totally pulls the rug out from under traditional Western thought while simultaneously showing how entrenched we are in it... this comes up in his book ""Inner Revolution"" which you read all throughout the semester.  It's a unique course for a number of reasons, beginning with how Thurman doesn't treat the subject matter as some bs theoretical thought experiment, but truly believes what he says.  That goes further than might be obvious.  His personal connection to the material gives it real depth, and if you're engaged in it you may find that it can... dare I say... make your life more meaningful.  No class I've taken so far has been more influential to my everyday thinking, and taking it during the election of 2016 was especially profound... i know i wasn't the only one who found those two days a week the most inspiring.
Thurman's a badass, super funny and self-deprecating, very quotable, very famous, definitely prone to tangents (which almost always DO relate and come back to the material), very political, and seriously knowledgeable.  Sometimes doesn't give thorough explanations of the Sanskrit terms, but very thorough explanations of esoteric buddhist concepts, many of which he's made iconoclastic interpretations of, if that's your thing.  Unlike some of the previous reviews, I only remember a few days when he read through the readings in class and it was super boring.  He only missed two classes, and he did read our discussion posts. 
The class focuses mostly on the origins of Buddhism in India and the later advent of Mahayana Buddhism, then pivots to Tibet for the last few weeks, ending in current Tibetan religious/cultural affairs.
It may not be for everyone, especially if you want something very technical or you think politics (or film) has no place in class. The technical is in the reading.  Discussion section was kind of a bust.  But Prof. Thurman's my man

Professor Burgstaller is an immensely intelligent economist and is well versed in the history of economic thought. This class is focused on heavy readings and carefully analyzing the macroeconomic applications from influential economic works. He is an incredibly kind man and tries to engage students in class. He explains concepts so well that I can recall exactly the examples he used. 
He records each lecture and posts it on courseworks, along with pictures of the board with his notes. Unfortunately many students do take advantage of this accessibility and skip on attending lecture. He makes Adam Smith as interesting as possible, although most of the readings are a dry read.

She re-reads each book with the class and constructs thoughtful discussion points to highlight the most important parts of each text in an interesting and engaging way.

Note: She's usually on SSOL as Mary Pollard Murray, which confused me when I first searched for her on CULPA.
I had Molly Murray for Lit Hum two years ago, and she went on sabbatical afterwards. My advice: if you're lucky enough to wind up in her class, DO NOT switch out. We were the only section in that year to not have a single student drop; in a mandatory class with students of all interests, everyone tailored their schedules to make sure they could stay with her. That should speak for itself, but I'll keep going anyway.
She tends to get lost in tangents with the class, but it's a 2-hour course and we always got through the material just fine. So if that's somehow a drawback, it's a small one to consider. I wouldn't say she's a tough grader, but her feedback is honest and your grade will reflect it. But she's rooting for you.
Otherwise, I think she ruined me for most future professors. She witty, cool, collected, speaks most languages that you'll encounter on the syllabus (and brings the original texts in those languages to reference as needed). She's extremely knowledgable but not in a way that keeps you from engaging. If you have an inkling of an idea, you can throw it out there and you'll probably get a ""say more!"" as she helps you build upon that idea.
What's more, it's really touching to have a teacher that can take an interest in her students like she does. Especially if you have her for Lit Hum and she's a big part of your freshman experience. 
I also agree with a past review about her dress. It's hardly the most impressive thing about her, but it's a little heartbreaking that she dresses so well on top of everything else.

While Gail seems to have many great reviews on this site, this review is specifically for the Chamber Singers class, which might one of the most boring, unrewarding, and frustrating choir experiences I've ever had.
First of all, auditions are not required for the choir. At first, this might seem like a good idea, but since the group is so small, one or two bad singers can really ruin the choir's sound, and it did. The levels of musicality among students varied so widely that it was usually impossible to have a decent musical or educational experience in the class.
Second, beware that the style of music changes each semester. My semester happened to feature very dissonant, contemporary music that was both aesthetically hard to adjust to and difficult to sing. Meanwhile, the choir next semester sang strictly baroque music, if I remember right. Either way, each semester can be a completely different experience just based on the music selection
Third, many people seem to say that Gail is a musical genius, which might be true. In my class, however, the only thing that shone through was her ability to sightread. What a frustrating experience. She was clearly never prepared for our class and consistently played wrong notes and rhythms for us, making our learning of the music way more time-consuming than it needed to be.
Unfortunately, I can't say many good things about this class, so if you really want a fun, enriching choir experience, consider taking something else, even if it's with her. If anything, the larger Chorus class seems like a great alternative.

Anna can be nice and all, but the class was super dry and Anna for some reason approached us in a really hesitant, restrained manner, as if she didn't have faith in her own teaching. That's not to say that she's a bad teacher--she taught the curriculum exactly as it needed to be caught and made sure to cover all the most relevant concepts. In the end, I learned what I needed to know in the class. However, a note about the curriculum: it's terribly boring and probably not the best way to even learn the language, since it focuses on rote memorization and throws you a whole bunch of charts of endings all at once. In the end, all the information becomes such a blur that you can't even grasp the basics without confusing them with something else.

I never thought I would read such a scathing review about Mutch as the one below me. In the end, though, I kinda see where they're coming from. Kind of.
In my experience, Mutch's class was very easy to coast through, though this is coming from someone who's familiar with music, music theory, and a little bit of music history. Actually, Mutch's class was very easy. I never had a problem with grading (his prompts were indeed easy and I got good grades), and the information lectured in class was easy enough to follow along with. When you participate, he does tend to respond with a cold silence, but I thought that was just him letting students talk and get their participation points. The hardest part of that class was probably the listening quizzes he gave, where you listen to songs for homework and have to identify them (with their composer and larger work) in class. 
Mutch is actually kind of a goofy guy, but I decided to keep my distance from him because of how I ashamed I was for falling asleep literally every class. Oh well, I got a good grade so I guess he didn't seem to care that much. So I don't really know his real personality, but all in all, it's just music hum, and his section is easy enough to coast through, fulfill that requirement, and get a decent grade.

At times, the class activities were a bit dumb and a waste of time, but I assume that's how it was for every section.
The only unique thing about this section is an extra essay you have to write about a topic of your own choice. It's not really a big deal, though.

PROS: Such a nice professor, who really goes out of her way to make a connection with her students, and constantly encourages you to go to her office hours just to say hello. Also a very reasonable grader, if not too much so. Our class was the first one she ever taught at Barnard, and she was sometimes a pushover when we complained about how things were graded. She gave us all extra credit on the midterm because she was convinced she made it too difficult! Probably won't happen again though. Prof. Green also makes sure people really understand the class readings and presents material in simple, easy to understand ways.
CONS: The class material itself was a bit disjunct and messy at times. By the end of the class, I felt like I haven't gotten much more than knowing I had read a bunch of stuff without being able to piece overarching themes together. Discussions also tended to drag on for way too long, despite it being a lecture class. For example, we spend a whole three weeks talking about a single author because she for some reason couldn't quite explain to us the different between an ""icon"" and an ""index,"" which in the end is not that difficult of a concept to grasp. I personally would not take one of her classes again, because I felt a little brain-dead during her lectures sometimes. But if you're not looking for a very rigorous anthro class, Prof. Green might be the way to go.

That being said, keep in mind that Korean Civ is a lecture class, and having her lecture to a whole room over a crackling microphone speeding through powerpoint slides is a probably a very different experience from having her in a seminar.
PROS: Prof. Kim is a very friendly, funny person and worth visiting for office hours. She presents interesting information in her lectures and assigns readings on interesting topics about Korea's history and culture. A lot of them verge on anthropological and historiographical topics that make you change the way you think about history in general.
CONS: Coupled with her microphone, her thick Korean accent, and her fast pace in teaching the class, Prof. Kim can be very hard to understand. In the end, I gave up taking notes because all the information sped by way to fast and incomprehensibly for me to properly write down everything. Instead, I just downloaded her powerpoints, which she fortunately posts on CourseWorks, and those (plus the readings) were enough to give me good studying notes for the midterm and final. Prof. Kim also tends to just read off the powerpoints word for word, which can make the class pretty boring. The problem is that, while you could just read the powerpoints on your own time, you still need to show up to class, because if you don't, she might call you out!! Every time we had class, she would call out a few names from her roster of people to commend them on a good reading response, but if you weren't there when she called your name, she would dock off points for attendance.
Workload:
Overall pretty heavy. Lots of readings, plus hefty reading responses on specific prompts that you have to do before you even cover the material in class. Basically you're also covering two different time periods at once because of what you're learning in class vs. what you're reading for class. This can make the information overlap in really confusing ways. There's also two essays, a midterm, and a final, all of which are graded pretty fairly.

Fantastic TA. I don't know how much he's going to TA in the future, but he already has a couple semesters in the past so it might be worth it to say here that Thomas (people call him Tommy, but he might be mad if you say that) is one of the funniest, most engaging, and most thought-provoking TAs I've had here. He really knows a lot about Korean history and will always get excited when you try to see history in different ways. He also does a great job leading discussions and encouraging students to have their own voice and be ""provocative"" about history. You'll learn a lot from him.

I have never written a Culpa review, but Xavi is truly one of the best professors I have had in college and I think he deserves a lot more praise than his profile currently has. I took Intermediate Spanish I with Xavi in the Fall and it was my favorite class - something I have never been able to say for Spanish. He was engaged and excited about teaching and helping his students improve in a way I had never seen. I think that my Spanish improved significantly over the course of the semester and he even inspired me to pursue Spanish as a minor. Everyone should try to take a class with Xavi - he is a true gem of the Spanish Department. Even if you're only taking Spanish because you need to fill your language requirement, he will make you excited to come to class.

Professor Baker is wonderful. He's incredibly enthusiastic about everything he does, from grappling with dense texts across the LitHum syllabus to planning class outings where everyone can get to know each other better and apply LitHum topics across disciplines. He makes everyone feel welcome, encouraging people to share their thoughts no matter how fully formed. He's equally friendly--if not more so--in office hours, when you can talk about papers or favorite books you've read or anything going on in your life, really. He's super supportive and wants to get to know all his students as well as possible to help them realize their full potential and feel comfortable in class. Three papers per semester seemed like a lot at first, but he often gives a variety of creative options and is equally open to creating your own topic. Especially during second semester, he's given us essay prompts that allow for the type of introspection and consideration of the big ""core questions"" that I think LitHum is really all about. I have no doubt that the takeaways from this class will serve me far beyond my time at Columbia, and that Professor Baker will be a close mentor and confidante of mine throughout college.

David was an awesome teacher. Every week of this course was devoted to a different facet of Spanish culture or international context throughout the time period leading up to, during, and following the Spanish Civil War. It was clear that David was deeply interested in many of the topics we talked about; when discussions got slow he would offer his insights to provide food for thought or guide the discussion in a direction we could share more about. He's an incredibly sweet person, but is pretty sarcastic and humorous during class which made everyone feel more at ease. He was super helpful during the process of writing final papers for the class, suggesting lots of resources and possible approaches. The workload was also relatively light, but if you do all the readings it'll be easier to participate in class which is important in such a small seminar. Highly recommend if you're at all interested in sociopolitical issues surrounding the rise of fascism, international relations, or cultural identity in Spain.

Ross Posnock is the best teacher I have ever had. Though the course was listed as a lecture, only 7 students enrolled so it turned into a seminar-style class very quickly. I actually did all the readings because I wanted to understand the genius of his observations; he is one of the most eloquent men I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Though he makes his liberal politics quite obvious, he brings in very well-curated commentary to discuss each text (such as the art critic TJ Clark to talk about Stephen Crane), which he always reads from hand-written notes. He repeated themes often, but made me love the books we read and provided useful comments on my papers. I only regret not going to his office more, which is lined from floor to ceiling with books.

If you love history, take this class. If you're interested in modern consumerism, gendered ideas of consumption, the rise of capital, the idea of the dandy, philosophical understandings of trains, or the evils of Walmart--take the class. The readings are wide ranging and the subject matter is super applicable to tons of stuff today. 
The seminar is relaxed and there's plenty of room for students to step in and contribute. Tiersten's focused on text sources, but she brings in relevant art and movies to the class. You'll get a great feel for early Europe and there's discussion about modern consumerism in America too.  
Whether you like consumer culture or not, the best reason to take the class is Tiersten. She's funny, down to earth, dedicated, and altogether a great historian. She knows her subject matter like the back of her hand. Ask her a question about any place or time in history and she'll spout off the top sources to read and things to know. More importantly, she wants you to succeed and is there to help you do it.

Assignments are easy, the midterm and final (both take-home!) take you 3 hours tops if you took notes or did the readings. Really great class. The only thing that was somewhat difficult was the discussion section, which kept you on the ball with reading. Great TAs, though!

Andrea is a very nice person. She really tries to get the class to engage in discussions and she sometimes brings food.
Those are the good things about her.
She expects too much from her students during the essays (she continually grades harsher with the more essays you write, and this increases during 2nd semester), and she expects that everyone is heavily interested in the stuff to begin with. 
She decided to get very creative with the 2nd essay of 2nd semester, making us write an argumentative essay based on the physical features of 3 editions of the same text. All other classes did a normal essay, so it was overall a very boring experience.

This was Professor Pilkington's first time teaching this course, I believe Professor Harris has always taught it in the past, and I was presently surprised. I took this course to fulfill a survey course credit for my Barnard History major. I had never taken an ancient history class before and I'm glad I took this one. Professor Pilkington is incredibly knowledgable, funny, and overall a great professor. He is trained in archeology, so he kept it interesting by not following the typical historian view, as I understand Professor Harris used to teach. His exams are fair and there is one paper assignment that's fairly doable. He doesn't grade anything, however, so it entirely depends on your TA. I had a tough TA and will probably receive a B+ in the course but if you attend every single lecture and do the reading on time, it might be relatively easy to get an A in the course. He posts the notes online in PowerPoint, so it's really not necessary to attend every lecture, just the important ones. Pilkington is entertaining enough that you might actually want to attend every class, though.

This is literally the WORST class I have ever taken in Columbia. If you care about your time just a single tiny bit, DO NOT CHOOSE HER CLASS. I've taken AP stat in high school so the class turned out to be easily doable, but I find it EXTREMELY BORING. She reads off her powerpoint which is directly taken from the book WORD FOR WORD, and when people ask a question in class, she would just REPEAT what the slide says, no explanation ever.
Well, you might say, what if I care nothing about STAT and I'm only taking this for the requirement? In that case, I can tell you that it's still not worth it. I'm taking this class for this exact reason. I would expect that I can skip class if all she wants to do is read the powerpoint. However, she gives a ridiculously easy ""attendance quiz"" EVERY SINGLE LECTURE, forcing people to come to class. This point basically defeats the purpose of taking it since it's easy.
If you're a perspective Stat major or even considering it, DO NOT TAKE IT. It would be a huge turn off for stat and you might not want to take a stat class ever again in your life. Personally, I don't care if I get a heavier workload if I know I'm learning something, but if I'm not learning, I want to save time to go to the EXTREMELY BORING lectures. This class is neither: it doesn't teach you anything, and it wastes your time forcing you to go to all the lectures.
You might consider this class for its extremely light workload, but remember, you go to Columbia to learn, and there's a reason your major requires you to take this class. If you took AP Stat in the past, you will learn NO new things and waste at least 3 hours every week, and if you haven't taken stats before, you will waste 3 hours in lecture every week and have to spend extra time teaching yourself the material.

I love Dr. Wisor as a person -- I think she's kind, intelligent, and interesting to talk to. She's flexible and willing to give class time to have an important discussion about something related to the readings. 
HOWEVER, because she takes this time, valuable time is taken away from talking about writing strategy. This was the first time I have ever been in college -- refreshers on certain more complex grammar rules would have been nice, as well as learning more about how to properly structure an academic essay. I, unfortunately, had to learn these lessons on my own, and after being harshly graded. 
She gives off the vibe of someone who is very enthusiastic to teach, and unfortunately that translates into tough grading. I wouldn't mind this if she gave us a real opportunity with her feedback, but it still feels like her expectations aren't known to me.

Professor Saba taught a great survey of Islamic art, touching on the foremost exemplars of the Islamic artistic tradition ranging from calligraphy to architecture and textiles. A background in Islamic art isn't necessary to do well in this course, and it serves as a nice introduction if you want to build a foundation in the area to take more advanced classes later on. 
The class size was fairly small, which allowed for a lecture-leading-into-discussion format that I really appreciated. Definitely a welcome change from a typical art history lecture, and I felt I got more out of it by engaging with classmates directly in almost every class. 
The class is object-oriented, meaning that you'll be viewing a selection of specific objects and discussing their qualities and context. Note that for this particular class, the majority of the objects studied were architectural, i.e. lots of mosque architecture. There was a fair amount of calligraphy and some precious objects such as crystal and ceramic wares, but these were not the focus, so do be aware of that if those are your areas of interest. 
The TA, also named Matthew, was really wonderful as well and led a few of the lectures. Both he and Professor Saba were easily accessible and were very fair in grading. Would highly recommend this course to those wishing to get a taste of Islamic art.

I love Professor Biers class! She is so intelligent, so smart and so so nice. She fosters great class discussions, guides it and gives great insights into the texts. Her class is almost all discussion based, very little lecturing. She has this magic to turn really boring texts (what I thought when I first read it) into really interesting discussions. From what I have heard of my friends' sections, she is not the cozy, snuggly professor that will bake you muffins and take you to dinner, but she definitely will let you grow intellectually. It did take me a while to adjust to her style - a little intimidating at first. But in the end, this has been my favorite class freshman year. 
In terms of grading, I think she doesn't grade easy but definitely not unreasonable. If you put in the work that you should for this class, you will get a lot out of it and your grade will reflect your effort.

Bostick is hands down the worst professor I've had at Barnard/Columbia. If you have the option to take this class somewhere else, definitely jump on it. The only saving grace of the class is that it's not too much work - Bostick is so disorganized (and busy) that he never has time to write or grade problem sets. We turned in 5 assignments this semester and have not received a grade on a single one; our midterm was handed back 6 weeks after we took it, long after the PDF and withdraw deadlines. Also, at the end of our first midterm, Bostick told students he would likely lose the hard copies of their exams so students would need to take their exams home and scan them into Canvas.
If the disorganization isn't enough, Bostick can't help but speak condescendingly to his students during class and office hours. Whenever you ask a question, he rants about how students can't perform basic operations in chemistry and how we would understand the material if we ""just use logic."" Never mind that the question was about a specific area of content.

I have such mixed feelings about this class. I am just finishing the fall 2017 semester of this class and i think at different times in the semester i have both loved and hated the class. let me break it down for you:
The Lectures: 
The lectures are literally going to be your least favorite part of the class. The professor is pretty much just going over slides. There is always an outline of the lecture given ahead of time so you can follow along as well as all power point slide shows. These don't serve as a good representation of the all the information thrown at you in this course though. Professor D'altroy knows his stuff. He throws a huge amount of information at you in each lecture in large part just from the massive amount of knowledge he has in his head. he clearly is passionate about the subject and extremely knowledgeable. This format of sitting for an hour just looking at slides listening to someone speak is indeed incredibly boring, but its also the most important part of the class to ensure your success. if you want an A you need to attend because there is no source wether it is the book, recitations or all the youtube videos on the web that are going to encapsulate what you need for the exams as well as terrance's lectures. Take notes every lecture, ask questions and try your best to stay attentive and you will be fine. 
The readings:
they were a mix of fairly interesting to incredibly boring. there were a ton of readings provided broken into different levels of importance, but truth be told if you pay enough attention in lecture and take good notes then most of the readings largely wont even be needed. youll need to draw upon them for the papers but beyond that you can easilly do well without them. 
Overall:
honestly i feel like i learned alot in this class. It goes from a very laid back feeling to a very hectic class around midterms/finals because all of a sudden you need to contextualize thousands years worth of information and it can seem overwhelming. very little direction is given in terms of what exactly to study for exams and it can be stressful, but usually if you just study an overview of everything and few important sites/people from each region you will be set for the exam. dont take this class lightly, if you slack off too much you will find yourself lost.

The course unfortunately falls into all the stereotypes of a Columbia humanities course. If I could break down the proportion of time spent on learning different aspects of Japanese History it would be - 50% Gender and Sexuality, 30% Art and Mythology, 20% Politics and Economics. The readings are sometimes pretty good, but the lectures are all monolithic in their focus on gender relations and art. If you want to learn about wars, leaders, economic relations, and other things generally expected from a history course, don't take this one. If what you care about in Japanese culture is art, poetry, and the role of women, then it's for you. Professor Pflugfelder is an excellent professor and is very knowledgeable in the fields that the class focuses on. However, the lectures rarely include elements of political or military history as that aspect of the class is relegated to readings from a rather dry textbook.

Let me start by saying this: this is not a conventional language class. Nevertheless, prof. Gozzi's class was definitely one of my favorites in my four years at Columbia and I truly encourage you to take it!
The best thing about this class is prof. Gozzi - Extremely knowledgeable, attentive, understanding, precise, and demanding. What I love the most is the fact that every class was different. We could start our class by revising some grammar and soon divert our attention to discuss in details the perfect recipe to cook pasta, why Moldovans speak Italian so well, or the movie that she saw night. At first one might doubt her unconventional teaching methods and the seemingly hot-mess of a class, but soon one realizes that he or she could speak Italian and draw on vocabulary and grammar rules that weren't implicitly taught; the seemingly unorganized class is masterfully orchestrated by the brilliant prof. Gozzi!
I also liked the variety of subjects and means of study. The Immagina textbook and the VHL website are very organized and cover all the necessary materials and more. In addition, prof. Gozzi uses that CourseWorks system to assign additional worksheets and interesting links. We watched some short-films, full-length films, and a 10-episode series in Italian which were all great. Watching most of them didn't feel like doing HW at all. Once a week, prof. Gozzi assigned us an Italian song, that usually conveys the weekly grammar rules. The songs are super-addictive and we had great fun singing them together in class.
Last, there are some extra activities like a field trip to the Met Museum, New York Opera, and film screenings. Prof. Gozzi's knowledge of European culture is very profound and she has a way of sharing it in a very approachable, non-condescending, manner.
This class is not a walk in the park but it is tons of fun and I found myself pumped before each of our sessions. After taking this class, I feel much more comfortable communicating in Italian and much more connected to the Italian culture.
Oh yes, and if you put up the time, there is no reason not to get an A.

If you have an opportunity to take him, pull the trigger. Without a doubt the best professor I've had at Columbia. I switched in to his CC section after the first semester (not knowing who he was) and it might have been my best academic decision yet. He's knowledgeable on every text and pushes for a more diverse selection of literature. Also very athlete-friendly but does not treat athletes any more special than other students. Includes field trips (movies) and activities (mock trials, organized debates, etc.) to keep us engage. Also a lenient grader. I went from a B- essay writer to a A- essay writer.

I think there are more lenient graders but by that I mean you could find more lenient professors but Francisca grades very fair, nothing to complain about.

I agree with most of the comments below. Jervis is a brilliant man but a horrible lecturer. BUT I don't think you have to go to lectures in order to get a good grade because 85% of the class does not go including myself. You won't learn anything. Nothing he talks about will be on a quiz or an essay prompt. You're better off completing the readings and attending the once a week discussion sections because TAs tend to hint at what readings will be on the quiz.If you're fortunate enough to have friends taking the class with you then I would split the readings up, read them thoroughly, and make a google doc because there's an absurd amount of reading and none of them are interesting.

I'll make it short: Take this class. Your grade is completely in your control. If you don't leave with a solid A you should be disappointed in yourself.  If you show up to every class and discussion section and then simply complete every assignment you get an A. That. Is. It. 
The material is also very interesting. He calls out the sins of our country and touches on material that is ""edgy"" or ""controversial"". And since the grade is in your control, you feel free to focus on learning and asking question rather than remembering and regurgitating information. It is very easy to just slack off and do the bare minimum and get nothing out of this class but I found myself very engaged in the material.

This course is only for those very interested in physics and/or math, and looking to challenge themselves. The materials covered are challenging but quite interesting. Mawhinney is very knowledgeable and goes at a reasonable pace; while the math is sometimes hard to follow, usually everything becomes clear with some self-study/reading the textbook. He is very nice and willing to answer any questions you have during class or after class, and also tends to be available during office hours. He always goes through the easiest concepts in a topic before moving on to the hard stuff, which is good for refreshing one's memory. He also likes to go through bits of history behind the physics which not everyone likes. Exams are very hard but he curves generously. Overall this is a rewarding class and I would recommend it.

Unless you are a math genius (scored nationally in the AMC or something along those lines), you will have an incredibly tough time getting a B+ or above in this class. This class is packed with math geniuses who ruin the median, bringing it up to 80-ish levels. Basically how it ends up working out is you either get the math completely or you don't get what's going on, which makes the distribution super skewed and thus hard to do well in unless you're one of those who has amazing math skills. I got an A in Calc III and an A in Intermediate Macro as a freshman, and am having a tough time even getting a B in this class.

Professor Edwards is fantastic. He is engaging, funny, and extremely smart. This was a really great class, and I learned a ton. That being said, the project is definitely a ton of work, so start early! The material that you learn in class doesn't help much with the project itself.

Professor Young... what a guy! A very rare gem in the Statistics department-- he really cares about his students, and you can tell very easily. He holds multiple office hours a week to help kids with homework, and is extremely kind and accommodating. He is an extremely sweet guy, and very honest and genuine. Additionally, he speaks clearly, is receptive to his students and has a slideshow prepared for every day. 
Statistics is not always the most interesting topic-- and Professor Young KNOWS this. In fact, during lecture, he will often say things like: ""Sorry, I know this is super boring. But it is also really important!"" However, for the really complicated things, he doesn't always explain in the best way. For example, he will put a really mathematically intense equation on the board and then say, ""Well I hope that makes sense."" Overall though, he is really a great professor, and probably the best one in the Stats department.

Do not take this class if you value your tuition money! Poor lecture held only once a week.
Professor Ciolkowski was clearly very passionate about her work, however, this passion frequently obstructed her ability to teach the material of the course. She constantly brought up outside work (often from popular culture or her work as a Victiorianist) to the point where we would spend only a fraction of the lecture talking about the reading at hand. Now, this would not be so horrible, as the examples she brought up were often interesting and somewhat relevant, if it were not for the most egregious flaw of the course: lecture was only once a week. When the midterm and final exam are assessing knowledge of the reading, the lectures ought to encourage knowledge of the reading. When there is only one lecture, all of the information of copious reading must be condensed into one hour and fifteen minutes. There is not time for an excess of outside material yet, without fail, every time Professor Ciolkowski would try to fit an excess of material and often sacrifice examination of the readings for that material. The design of this course is inherently flawed or, at the very least, does not allow for Professor Ciolkowski's lecturing style. 
To speak to the quality of the course in general, I felt that the reading excessive and incohesive as that lectures were similarly ill-planned. In particular, Professor Ciollkowski's lectures were often more about what she found interesting rather than what the readings were actually about, which ultimately hurt the students taking the course since the midterm and final assessments were structured around understanding of the readings. Furthermore, the connections between the themes of each week were scarcely stressed. It felt as if I was taking a sample of several different classes as opposed to one, complex class, and the themes scarcely built upon one another especially in lecture. Overall, I would describe the class as overambitious and unsuccessful in it's goal to be equally complex and wide-reaching and I would attribute this failure to the fact that lecture was only held once a week. Students were only given one lecture from each professor every other week. As a result, I felt that I was getting a quarter of two separate classes (the two professors had completely disparate lecturing/teaching styles) rather than a whole one. So not only was I disappointed in the quality of the class, but, furthermore, I felt I was paying the professors for time not spent teaching.

I most value the exposure to the different coding languages/software that we learned to use (R, Stata, QGIS, LaTeX, Excel), as well as the introduction to development economics. The course was nowhere near as traumatizing as I expected it to be, despite all the analytical work that we had to do. The assignments were absolutely reasonable, although they took a lot longer than she seemed to think they would. I'm finishing the course feeling that I picked up more technical skill here than I have in all 3 years combined otherwise. Grading was, for the most part, fairly reasonable or even easy.

Professor Webster made it possible to stay awake for a long Friday morning class. He has a sense of humor and teaches the material in a completely straightforward manner. He could answer any question thrown at him and anything covered on the exam was made clear in class. Although he initially rubbed me the wrong way with his controversial jokes, he eventually won over most of the class (it seemed) by just teaching us what we needed to know.

Do NOT take this class with this professor unless you already have a stats background. I'm taking Intro Stats with her in the spring and the previous reviewer is on point. The class is extremely disorganized and during lecture she blows through PPTs that are just copied text/graphs from the textbook. It wouldn't be so bad if she gave us the PPTs before class so if we missed something we can note it, but instead she refuses to do that and posts them WEEKS after class. She also posts problem set assignments late so sometimes you'll have a week to do it and sometimes less because she forgot to post it, which sucks because it takes FOREVER to complete it. You have to constantly check online if she posted anything, or make it so that you get an email notification. The problem sets themselves are ridiculous...so many problems!! AND it's only 5% of your grade. 
I've tried to see her after class because I can't go to her office hours but she never responds to emails, and when she does it's weeks later saying she didn't have time. If you ask her a question after class she'll say ""It's in the textbook or class notes"". Funny, because if I had understood it or saw it in the textbook then I wouldn't be seeing her for extra help! She's a nice person, but absolutely the worst professor I've ever had. It's like she doesn't even want to teach and does the absolute minimum. For about a month we had to do ""in-class group worksheets"". AWFUL. She doesn't lecture and then picks people to put their answers on the chalkboard, but she doesn't get through all the questions on the worksheet (of course doesn't post answers) so you don't know if you did it right. If you have to take this class and find yourself struggling, get yourself a tutor or go to the Stat help room. Maybe you'll have a different TA for the class but I found the one we have this semester to be too smart to teach so he made concepts even more confusing.
The midterms are easy - if you know what to do study for. Absolutely frustrating because it's so much material and she picks random things to test you on. If you didn't study that random thing, well, good luck because it's 1/3 of the midterm. Oh and if you have a question during the exam, GOOD LUCK again! She doesn't allow you to ask questions during exams. Everything should be ""straightforward"". They are also cumulative, you get no practice midterms, and she doesn't post answers to the midterms. The group project is a joke and only 5% of your grade. 
Needless to say, this class has been the most disorganized, frustrating class I've ever taken. Take it with a different professor or in the summer if you can.

Soooo interesting, taught very well, and relevant to life. He covered almost everything that was on the test in class, although he purposefully put a number of book questions on the tests (especially on the second).
It was a lot of memorization and I wouldn't say an easy A, but the material itself seemed far more straightforward than the convoluted stuff you see in many of the other Chem- and Bio-heavy classes. It definitely felt more like an intro to chem and bio through the crazy interesting lens of the brain, so to me that felt like the perfect taste of science without having to do the boring intro classes.

Pascale is one of the best professors I have had so far. She always comes to class in a good mood and has an infectious energy. She bounces around the room while explaining most questions or structures and tries to use as much french as possible to explain something if someone does not understand. Though I have not needed extra time on anything, she was extremely nice to people when they forgot or couldn't get something in on time. The quizzes are easy-ish if you study and the homework is quick each night. It's just a normal language class so you will have to expect to put in the effort to get anything out of it.

Hadley (she lets us call her by her first name) is so sweet and kind. I am never too intimidated to speak up in class. More so than anything her encouragement fostered my learning. This is my second time being in her French class. Last semester I was so nervous to be in a college level French course. My high school French teacher was judgmental and instilled fear in all of her students. After taking Hadley's class not only do I love studying French but I am leaning towards making it a part of my degree. I never had this confidence with language learning before. In the past, I would have never been brave enough to practice my French with native French speakers but now, when I run into someone that speaks French I have the courage to open my mouth and at least try. I say this knowing that I am not the best French student out there. It is just amazing to have a professor who sees potential in all of her students. I wish I could take French with her again. If she was teaching intermediate II I would take it with her. She is also knowledgeable about French cultural and philosophical movements which she sometimes incorporates into the curriculum.

Don't bother buying the textbook, to be honest. She never checks. The workload is super light in my opinion. Regular weekly homework is kind of optional. Other than that there are around 3 quizzes a semester. 3 compositions- the way this work is that you write a page and a half double spaced then turn it in then she corrects it and tells you exactly what to change and then you fix those errors, resubmit it and watch your grade go up. There's also a final and a few projects. She is a very very easy grader. Her class was the easiest class I took this semester.

This is by far the worst course I have taken here. I am specializing in security so I have other security CS classes, and can compare. It's just really bad. The content overlapped with other classes too much. I have learned more from single assignments in other classes than I did from this entire class. 
Debbie seems to mean well but is unfortunately a terrible teacher. Her lectures are boring and honestly I could barely even hear her. She stares at her own slides and doesn't see you when you raise your hand to ask a question. Her notes are poorly organized and written in sentence fragments that leave out crucial context. She has basically no office hours. In the first lecture, I thought it was weird how she placed such strong emphasis on how important it was to come to class on certain days; it quickly became clear that this was because everyone was about to realize how useless it was to go to her class. I skipped about half of them and did better than almost anyone on the midterm. 
The written homeworks were boring and felt like busywork. I answered them 100% correctly, and the TA even admitted as much, but regretted that he had to take off points by following the specific wording of Debbie's answers.
The programming was better but was rare. In 4119 we implemented a toy cut-down version of TCP; how about implementing a toy cut-down version of a TLS handshake? That's what I thought this class was about, not reading news articles about Android malware.
The group project was a huge waste of time. I could have done the entire thing myself in two days but wasted a huge amount of time trying to coordinate with my randomly selected group. The program itself was pretty lame, too, and had all kinds of arbitrary/ambiguous requirements that were more annoying than useful.

Kevin definitely grew on me over the course of the year.  At first, I was disappointed by the amount of time he spent speaking to class instead of inciting discussion (because I was comparing it to Lit Hum, which for me was entirely discussion), however I ultimately became really grateful for the balance he placed between explaining concepts and moderating discussion.  He cleared up a lot of difficult concepts at the first of class, then let us discuss with a reasonable amount of moderation.  He has a great ability to make things understandable and explains things in a few different ways, which allows him to be effective for many learning styles.  In particular, I really liked his analogies and the incredibly helpful diagrams and visuals he drew out to explain important concepts.  I'm a visual learner and normally struggle with classes that are entirely discussion, so this was indispensable for me.
He did a really good job starting discussions and gauging the mood of the class to find what the students were interested in.  He's also freaking hilarious in a very Kevin Elliott kind of way.  You'll grow to enjoy his fondness for The Matrix and Star Trek references, his adorable love for his daughter, his annoyance with flies, and his tendency to swear for emphasis.
Some complaints I do have are that his feedback oscillated between being somewhat thorough and useful and being literally one or two sentences and confusing squiggly lines.  Moreover, this class is, without a doubt, more challenging than other CC classes.  We probably do about 25% more reading than other classes, and the workload itself is more than that of other CC classes I know of.  I also sometimes felt that he made some of the essay prompts intentionally almost impossible to answer in the way he was looking for.
Despite all this, if you end up in Kevin's class and you don't want CC to be a complete joke for you, then I'd stay in it.  Overall, I feel lucky to have had Kevin and wouldn't have changed professors if I could.

4 essays, but the 4th one is a revision.  They're pretty hard topics.  Go to office hours and listen to people asking questions before the essay is due; this was the most helpful thing to do.  They're like 5 - 8 pages or something like that.  He graded a little leniently, in my opinion.  Definitely gave me some A- grades for papers that were much worse than an A-.
Midterms were pretty easy.  The IDs on both midterms were quite easy to identify if you knew anything about the works/authors, but he was kinda picky about the longer IDs/explanations of significance, etc.

Sunhee is an absolute gem and is so knowledgable in the Korean language. Although there are times the workload gets somewhat heavy its not because of her but just the way that the structure of the syllabus is and the workbook that comes along with the course (but there is a workbook that comes with every Korean course despite the level). She completely engages the class and her lectures are so in-depth about why we use a certain structure or phrase that I increased my speaking abilities exponentially just one semester in her class.

I've never written a review before but I just had to for Reyes. Her class is so interesting and she does a great job of generating class discussion. The workload can sometimes be very difficult, with readings that require some time and later guias (reading comprehension questions). However, not all of them are that bad, and if you do the readings and participate in class answering them will be easy. 
As for Reyes, she might possibly be the kindest and most understanding person I've ever met. She is very lenient with extensions, and if you go to her and tell her you have an issue, she will be more than happy to help you. She honestly just wants you to learn and to hand in good work. One time, I went to an office hours appointment with her, and she spent like 30 minutes giving me advice and just talking to me about life because I told her about a month earlier that I was struggling to figure out what to major in. I don't think that she will be teaching this class again, but if you have the chance to have her as a professor in any class, take it!

Professor Roma is without a doubt the single most influential professor I have had during my four years here at Columbia. He is a kind and wonderful human being. He is dedicated to his students, his craft, art, family, music. Everything he does he does for a reason and with dignity.
The stakes of this class are high. Professor Roma treats his students with respect but he expects you to fully commit to his classes. He believes that everyone who walks into the first class of Photo 1 is an artist and he treats them as such. That means students are expected to be able and willing to be intimate and vulnerable with their photography. If you are unable to do that, or unwilling to do that, do not take this class.

One of the strangest and enlightening experiences I have had at Columbia thus far, if you have the fortunate circumstance to take Music Humanities (or any other class) from Professor Garton I would highly recommend it. Having taken similar classes at other Uni's (GS student) I can say that Professor Garton makes the dull experience of learning some strange pieces of Western Music into somewhat of a fond experience. From his quirky personality and outbursts of awkward/self-deprecating jokes he reminds me that music isn't always about terms and book knowledge, but it is also Art that can be felt and experienced.

Professor Rieder was one of the best professors I've had during my time here. He took the most broad topic ""American Culture"" and created a syllabus that synthesized material in an incredible way and that covered a wide range of topics without losing depth and nuance. He was able to broach very difficult topics (race, religion, the Trump era) by focusing on methodology - ie how we should read into these things. He always presented two sides to every topic of study and treated both with the same importance and intellectual rigor. 
Overall, this class taught me how to think. It challenges common liberal assumptions and really makes you a smarter consumer of culture. I wish I took this course when I started school - it would have made me a much better student in all my other classes. Professor Rieder is one of the kindest and most invested professors I've met here. He truly cares about his students - he is so open to all opinions and perspectives and really makes students feel like their voices are valued in the classroom. Each lecture is captivating - he infuses music, humor, pop culture, relevant journal articles, and engaging anecdotes into each. The hour and 15 minutes fly by. I give the highest recommendation for this class - I truly have no idea where the negative reviews come from. If you just pay attention in class, you will have a firm grasp of the material and will think the midterm and final are a breeze.

I'd heard horror stories of other ML professors at Columbia, but Satyen turned out to be a dream. I believe he used Daniel Hsu's syllabus and materials throughout the course, but his style was much different. While Daniel focuses heavily on the math and the proofs and (I would assume) hope that intuition on the mechanisms of the ML models follows, Satyen would focus heavily on the visuals and step-by-step walkthroughs of everything before touching on the math. He hadn't taught before, but I feel like coming from industry was a boon because he seemed comfortable going through the same concepts a couple times to make sure everyone got it. He managed to make almost everything (even kernels!) readily digestible, and made me feel confident in being to implement models later in the homeworks.
My only gripe with him was the mathematical rigor of the exams. He lifted them straight from Daniel, who spends _his_ classes delving into math, so the dissonance between Satyen's style and the first midterm was jarring. When students pointed this out on Piazza, he made an effort to include more proof-based questions on the homeworks to give us exposure to the type of questions we might expect on the final. I still didn't do too well on the final, but neither did anyone else.

heard bai is teaching this again next year so wanted to post this (took it 2 years ago). if you want to actually learn metrics, this is the arguably the best intro to metrics columbia has to offer. personally i find metrics dry / wouldn't want to pursue this field further, but still did well in this class. he's good about reviewing stats before getting into the harder material. i also don't recall there ever being a mistake or typo on a pset or exam, and everything's pretty clear.

This was a new course for the Stats department that's before Applied Linear Regression. Young is a nice guy and did a really good job of explaining the code. He also posts the slides, so if you were't really paying attention in class or didn't get it you could go over it on your own. There really wasn't a lot of math involved in the course and anything that would require a background in stats (even intro level concepts) he gives you the code for and/or is happy to explain. 
He held OH twice a week which were usually pretty helpful although a little busy since he's was teaching a lot of courses. The TA for the course, Susanna, was amazing and was better at debugging than he was which saved a lot of people in the class, but I don't think she'll be returning next year.
Overall, I'd say this course was a great intro to R and not too time consuming. The course was pretty collaborative so when we had labs/homeworks it wasn't too tough to find a group of other people to expedite assignments. Although Intro is a prereq, I really think even high school level stats will get you through the course.

I took this in Fall 2016. Disclaimer: I got an A+.
Discrete math is an easy topic, but the professor is a bad, boring, slow lecturer, and the TAs are neither very friendly nor understanding (although very responsive). They all seemed to think they were much smarter than every student--and I'm sure they all A+'d the class and think this is easy stuff, but that doesn't give them an excuse to talk down to us. I have friends taking this now (Spring 2017), and they also think the TAs are very full of themselves and have times gotten into little spats with students on Piazza. They're constantly arriving late to office hours, sometimes unable to solve the homework problems that they make and assign themselves, and overall just incredibly pretentious.

Chamberlain was nice, smart, available when needed, and a good lecturer, although I strongly disliked the way he structured the course and assignments. He placed enormous emphasis on the readings (very dense and difficult to understand articles). Not only do the weekly reading responses add a great deal to the workload of the course as a whole, most of the assignments were based on the readings (midterm included a ""relevant references"" section, essay #2 was entirely based on the readings, final exam was a critique of an article). Most art hum sections don't actually require students to do the reading, and for good reason. I feel like this introductory course for non-art history majors made me detest art history. I would much rather focus on the actual art works than on articles that discuss the artworks. I ended up reading more for this class than for Lit Hum.
The vast majority of the class is spent on students answering questions, as Chamberlain calls on everyone once every class. This led to unproductive discussion as, instead of learning what Chamberlain has to say, we spend most of class listening to a scared student trying to bs something.

Bottom line: This is a dry course and for scientists. From day one, you are warned that you can expect a B+, never a good sign if, like any student at Columbia, you expect a perfect grade.
Professor Hoenisch gave this course for the first time in Spring 2017 and was obviously not at ease until the third tiers of the semester at least, in particular when it comes to the material about atmosphere. 
The title of the course does not entirely reflect the reality. From the beginning, you are overwhelmed with stats, complex figures and equations, all things she enjoys a lot. Be prepared for a tsunami of numbers that make any too rare lecture about the ""society"" part a relief. Society is mainly explored through complicated policies.
Occasionally, Peter B de Menocal gave some lectures and it was a entirely different world. He was obviously the master of his course and was able to make any difficult concept a breeze, engaging students in a way Professor Hoenisch could not do because she is not exactly a warm personality.
Professor Hoenisch is approchable but nevertheless build some extraordinary difficult tests and exams. The TA was a harsh grader. 
The class is highly challenging and not fun (unless given by de Menocal), the textbook is very dry also.

The most terrible course I had at Columbia. My review is not the reflect of a bad grade or personal feeling, although I felt miserable for the whole semester. However, it is not difficult to distinguish between my frustration and the reality of this course because I have faced many difficult courses and did perfectly well with them. 
Professor Nguyen gave this course for the first time at Columbia this Spring 2017 and it is hard to believe the committee at the Department of History gave her a free pass and validated her project. She often looked like she had no idea how to make this work.
The syllabus was revised not less than five times, a reflection of her inability to keep up with the schedule: lack of direction, a ""fun attitude"" in complete discrepancy with the topic, and a poor management of her slides.
She seemed not to have mastered how to explain her topic - she first went for a chronological order and then changed for a thematic one. Far too often, she made fun of her lack of knowledge, constantly postponing her answers to the students questions for later. 
The class was a mess overall, some students being completely disconnected from the beginning while some others obviously considered it as a breeze because they had a strong background in History. 
One TA was very easy to work with, trying to do his best to support his student, giving some fair grades. The other one was very nice and qualified but his expectations were completely irrational with the beginners, and he was a harsh grader.
A countless number of anomalies in this course. 
The workload was strange. The readings were interesting, but sometimes needlessly long. The discussions also varied depending on how much everyone had to say, and the TA would speak extensively far beyond the topics of the day, never giving any tips or guidelines for the exams, although he was available to answer questions by email or appointment.
Professor Nguyen has authored a book on the Vietnam War and assigned its to the class. but her topic was very concentrate and she seems to miss the big picture (particularly in matter of international relationships). With her level of demand through syllabus and assignments, it was the combination for the perfect storm.

Professor Bernstein CARES. He cares about what he teaches and how he teaches it. He also genuinely cares that you learn something in his class both about the field of organizational psychology and about yourself . He cares about being a good teacher and often provides opportunity for his students to give him feedback throughout the semester. He also cares about being a fair grader and provides extra credit opportunities and give students who have attended every lecture 5 points of extra credit, which allows the work of those who go the extra mile to be recognized. Most of all, he cares about his students and the experience that they have in his classroom.

I absolutely loved this class and consistently looked forward to lectures. Professor Jacobs was always highly engaging and made the material both fascinating and accessible. She also really made an effort to get to know her students and their names, and would remember a student's name after only one interaction with them. It was clear that she really cares about her students and wanted to see us succeed. 
I learned a lot about this time period - the course covers the Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II, with some lectures at the very beginning of the semester about the Roaring Twenties. Professor Jacobs clearly knows a lot about the material, and taught it both in depth and with clarity. 
One warning is that Professor Jacobs speaks fairly quickly and covers a lot of information, so you will be taking a lot of notes. But it is definitely manageable, and so so worth it. She also repeats the important information multiple times, so you will easily get a grasp of the main themes and concepts of the class. 
In terms of studying for the midterm and final in this class, you really only need to review your notes and make sure you understand the main concepts. As long as you pay attention in lecture and review your notes, you'll do very well in this class.
I would 100% recommend this class to anyone even vaguely interested in history or economics. Professor Jacobs is an absolutely outstanding professor, and you shouldn't miss the opportunity to take a class with her! 
Workload:
The workload for this class was very manageable. It's a history course, so there were about 100-150 pages of reading each week, which you had to read in advance of the weekly discussion section. There was one midterm, one easy 5-page paper, and a final for this course. For the tests, Professor Jacobs provides 4 essay questions ahead of time and picks 2 of them to be on the test, of which you choose 1 to write. There are also short answer ID questions. As mentioned above, the midterm and final do not require much studying. As long as you review your notes, pay attention in lecture (which isn't hard because Professor Jacobs is so engaging!), and have a good grasp of the main concepts, you'll do well in this class.

Do not take this class. Professor Heuer was a very dry lecturer, and did not explain the material for this class at all. Lectures were just him reading off a slideshow that he posts online, so you don't have to show up to class or even recitation. I taught the material to myself from the textbook before each test. 
It's also hard to do well in this class, because he doesn't do a good job of teaching it. If you're pretty good at math and have no problem teaching yourself the material, you'll be fine and probably do well, since the information isn't that complicated. But if you're worried about being able to keep up with the material and are looking for a professor who will actually explain the material and help you understand the math, this is not the class for you. He's also very forgetful and not very good at answering emails. 
It's very hard to know how you are doing in this class, because he is very vague about how your score on each test factors into your grade and what he's doing in terms of applying a curve.

The grade for this class depends entirely how you do on the three tests over the course of the semester. Each test has a multiple choice section and a problem-solving section.

DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. I cannot tell you how regretful I am that I took this horrible class. Snyder, while he is a very nice man, is a horrible lecturer. He goes too quickly between topics and is not even slightly engaging. I thought this class was going to be so cool but it truly is not. You will have weekly readings that are about 100-200 pages. And unless you are very motivated to continue to do these readings, it's very easy to fall behind as you only need to know the material for the take home midterm, take home final, and research paper. What's really going to get you is the 15 page term paper. The prompt is ""research something relative to this class"", you get very little help at all on the paper, and it's worth half of your grade, so don't mess it up.

Disclaimer: AP has been my favorite class at Columbia. 
The word around the street is that Jae is not as good in OS as in AP but I think people who say this are being unfair. Kernel hacking and OS theory are by nature tougher beasts. There is no easy way to approach the material without severely watering it down. I found AP to be more enjoyable but only because I never felt lost. Yes there were some frustrating debugging moments but I always knew the path the success. OS was different. I felt completely and utterly lost multiple times while doing the hws. I questioned my love of coding, my humanity and my sanity, all while cussing out this class and the kernel documentation. Jae thrusts you into the wild with just the basic necessities (the roadmap for HW7 was generous and appreciated) and we were forced to find our way home. Some can consider this bad teaching. I think of it as tough love. It was necessary to push you to the next level. AP was for teenagers, OS is for adults. Once I became more comfortable with the kernel and its ways (around HW7), I found the class just as enjoyable as AP. Overall, great experience. I only refrain from ranking OS among my favorite courses since I am pretty sure it gave me PTSD. Maybe in a few years I will look back at OS with endearment. 
The tests....They are much worse than AP's... coming from a guy who got 100 on the AP final. The T/F and multiple questions are really impossible to prepare for. Although the curve evens it out, I think it doesnt give students who've mastered the material a good opportunity to shine. 
If you loved AP, you'll love this class. You learn a ton. Some example HW's were building a scheduler and a filesystem for Linux. 
I maybe would've liked if Jae spent more time on OS theory and less on Linux specific stuff.

The work load for this class is insanity. I was warned but I did not heed the warnings since I received the same ones for Data Structures and AP, which I found to be easy and very enjoyable. OS was different. HWs 3,5,6,7 averaged over 40 hours of work. This class alone was WAY more work than all my other courses combined (4 in total).

McWhorter is a very engaging lecturer who keeps lectures interesting through a mixture of semi-relevant humorous digressions and videos and sound clips he found online. He has a nice voice and his explanations are generally very clear.
However, I thought this class was not as organized as his Introduction to Linguistics class. Sometimes he would go on tangents which would make it hard to keep track of what was going on. Furthermore, McWhorter would sometimes stop lecturing and spend the rest of class having students share their own experiences, which I didn't really care for since 1. some English majors would try way too hard to impress McWhorter or to play the contrarian and 2. who cares what other people think? I'm here to learn from McWhorter, not to spend half of class listening to other people hear their voices.

I had Professor Ivanyi this past semester for CC and really enjoyed it. The discussions were solid and she is very easily reachable. If you have any questions regarding reading or papers she answers very fast and is flexible to meet with you at times that work best for you. She is a little awkward at first with the class but as the she and the class get comfortable with each other it's a lot better. I would definitely recommend her for CC if you are looking for an interesting teacher. This is not one where you can just skip out on the work though or you will have trouble with the papers and exams.
Workload:
Your average CC reading load; 2 papers (5-6 pages) which is less than some who assign 3; midterm and final (4 out of 10 ID passages for both) 1 essay for the midterm and 2 for the final. TIP: read the sample essay prompts she gives on the study guide because they are VERY similar if not exactly the same as some of the ones she puts on the actual exam

WARNING: this class is pretty boring. Jervis is clearly a very very intelligent man (I mean half of the readings for this class are written by him) but he can be pretty hard to focus on during the lectures. If you're looking for an easy A this is not the class to take, you will need to put in the effort. However, I found that not going to the lectures and just to the recitation was more helpful for me because all he talked about in the lectures most of the time was Trump. After finishing this class I can say I did not learn that much. I do not think this is a good introductory course for the Political Science subfield, and do not let it turn you away from focusing on it because the courses in the International field are very interesting and more specific. This class just tries to cover too much material. 
Workload:
There is a good amount of reading for this class. It is split up into chunks for each subject covered; 3 in class quizzes (answer 6 out of 9 short answer questions) based on the readings; 2 take home midterms (1,200 word papers on the readings) and 1 take home final (2 1,200 word papers on the readings); You can get away with not doing the readings and getting summaries of them from friends but it will hurt you when you're trying to look for sources for the papers. TIP: collaborate with classmates and make study guides for the quizzes by splitting up the readings (there are a lot if you leave it for last minute)

Adam Cannon is a great professor if you're looking into the computer science field. He is a very good lecturer and explains the material very well. Along with that he keeps the class light and interesting so you won't lose focus. This is not a lecture you can skip though (well you can but I would not advise it), the class moves very fast and if you don't go you could miss out on important information for the problem sets and programming projects. This is a great class to take if you don't have any experience in the computer science field. Do not be discouraged if you don't understand stuff in the beginning the learning curve is big for this class. Along with that the TA's are very knowledgable and will help a lot. They all have different office hours as well as on Sundays when you can go to the class room for more help. There also is a Piazza page for the class to ask questions and they will answer fairly fast. Also, the curve is pretty big for this class. 
Workload:
The weeks alternate between a problem set and programming project(Do not leave these to the last minute); 1 chapter of reading a night (DO IT or you will not understand the homework's at all); Midterm in class with definitions and multiple choice (the practice questions he give are very similar to what you will see on the test and if you can get your hands on someone else's midterm from a past semester of his class it is super helpful and similar); Final with definitions, multiple choice, and short answer which includes writing some code; Heads up this is not an easy A course

This class is awesome!! It is normally only open to seniors but if you talk to professor Firestein then you can get in no matter what grade you are in. The seminars are super interesting and he brings in very cool guests to listen to. Even if you're not a science major, you will enjoy this. It is also an easy A if you do the work and go to class. Since it only meets 10 times in the whole semester, attendance is MANDATORY. One class near the end of the semester only 10 students showed up and he made a sign in sheet and all of the students that didn't come had to do extra work to get an A. Also Stuart is the man. He is so funny and honestly makes the 2 hour seminars fly by. 
Workload:
Readings are sent out about the upcoming speaker (you don't have to read them but they are interesting and let you know what you're about to hear); 3 250 word assignments (he lets you know at the end of each class who has to write that day which is why you have to show up or else you don't know what you're writing about; you are only given credit for the post if it seems like you were there and paying attention)

Pilkington is an awesome lecturer.  One of the few times I've been this engaged in class.  
He has a loud and brash persona but in  a sort of nice teddy bear way.  Most importantly, he really really knows his stuff.  I would take this class again in a heartbeat if he was teaching it.

As a senior, this is possibly one of the worst classes I have ever taken in the Columbia CS department. Full disclosure: I got an A in this class, so this isn't just whining.
Professor Ansaf is super nice but incredibly disorganized. She never showed up to class on time, and every class had ""technical issues"" that would last the first 15 minutes of lecture time. Furthermore, when she would teach, it would be rushed and very high level, when what you needed to know on the exams and homework were much more detailed. Again because of her disorganization, the first half of the class was very laid back - there was very little work and only two homeworks. Then, for some godforsaken reason she decided to assign homework 3 (the 2048 game, in my opinion, the hardest homework because of the necessary optimization problems) and have the midterm two days apart. It was endless sleepless nights because the homework took so goddam long and so did studying for the midterm. Her practice exam was only slightly helpful, and neither were her lectures for the midterm.
Side note: her exams don't test knowledge. They test speed. The midterm exam was absolutely ridiculous because it had about twice as many questions as were possible to answer in that time period. It was super frustrating, especially since none of the students knew that coming in, so a lot of people absolutely bombed that exam when we actually knew the content. When I went to talk to her about it, she said she wasn't going to help because everyone was graded on a curve. Okay, thanks for that nonexistent help. 
Finally, the last half of the class was incredibly rushed, because she realized she hadn't taught any of the topics she needed for the homeworks. So instead of giving us time for the assignments by spacing them out, she instead gave us an assignment every week. The homeworks are incredibly time-consuming (because you always have to optimize over and over again) so you barely had any time at the end of the semester to do anything. Finally, the final again was ridiculous. 
All I can say is that I hated this class. Professor Ansaf was disorganized and there were only 1 or 2 TAs that were actually helpful. In essence, take this class only if you're prepared to learn everything on your own, and get no support from the professor besides a curve.

Before I write this review, I would like to preface it: Professor Ansaf is probably the nicest, most committed teacher I have ever had at Columbia. She was incredibly personable, and always had time during her office hours to help or chat. 
So...I didn't think this was a good class. I know a lot of seniors took this class because it was supposed to be relatively easy where you still learned a lot. Unfortunately, neither of those were true this semester. This could be because this is the first time in two years that this course has been offered, or perhaps because she (very nicely) expanded the class to 275 students, so there was less one-on-one time with instructors. As it was, the Professor would show up late (despite her best efforts) every class because of a meeting directly prior to class. That's unfortunate, because it means the first 5-15min of class were used for setting up instead of lecturing. I think if the Professor knew she would be teaching a class at 1:10pm, she should have scheduled her meeting for another time (or vice versa). 
Additionally, the class was incredibly disorganized. The homework instructions were generally incredibly vague and because of that on Piazza there would be -- I kid you not -- 50-80 unanswered piazza posts during homework times. The homeworks were also badly managed, as they were more rushed in deadlines towards the end of the semester. Also, there was a time where a homework was due the same time as the midterm, which was incredibly distracting and in my opinion badly managed. Considering how much time the homeworks took, it was relatively disorganized schedule-wise.
The exams weren't much better - instead of testing the actual content of the class slides/lectures, they tested your speed in problem solving. If you're able to do each problem in about a minute to 5 minutes you'll be fine -- but that was not typical. If you take the exams, I recommend that you first focus on the highest weighted problems first -- aim for the max points in the least time, not about going in depth. The practice problems are good for general formatting, but not on timing. If the professor had added more practice problems for exams I think that would have helped. 
Finally, the TAs were generally useless. Of the about 10 TA's, all of whose office hours I went to, only about 3 were consistently able to answer my questions and help me on my homeworks. Jimmy/Ruicong was the best TA so I hope he stays on if this class gets taught again. 
In general, I wouldn't take this class again. I didn't feel like I learned anything, and the homeworks were just implementing algorithms in a really convoluted way.

Great class!  The lectures were boring, but the readings and assignments were fantastic.  Professor Sharpe made the classroom a very inviting space.  TA's were amazing too.

Never take class with Martin in IEOR, Martin is the worst professor in Columbia.
The topic of the class is interesting, however, Martin makes it a bad experience to learn it, rash through all topic without clear explanation, and all slide, both graph and text come from the reference book. But proof are deleted on purpose. Talk about some deep topic but do not provide any clear explanation about these topics. 
In the exam, he ask you to do proof that he never went through in class.  He pretends that he knows everything, but how could a guy know everything but never talk about anything in lecture.
learn the material by yourself is even better than learning with him.

Definitely one of the most incredible professors at Columbia. He cares tremendously about the class and the students and it was an absolute pleasure and honor to be in his class. Background: Professor John is a tenured professor at the Columbia Journalism school and his specializations are in communications and in American history. He's honestly an amazingteacher and actually cares about what the students think and what the students get out of the material. That being said, if you're looking for an easy-A professor that assigns minimal reading, Professor John probably isn't who you're looking for. Not that his class is like super hard or anything but if you want a good grade you're gonna have to work for it and actually engage with the material. If you're a student that actually cares about the core and CC and actually learning from these texts -- Professor John is right for you. He's also incredibly accessible outside of class which is not something that is true at all for many of the tenured professors here; he's always willing to have breakfast with students to talk about the texts or sometimes meet at times outside of office hours. We also went as a class to the Met Cloisters during the first semester and the regular Met in the second semester and both times were a ton of fun -- we all went out to dinner after and had a great time talking about what we saw and the course in general. Finally, in reference to the post above this one, I'm not quite sure I agree with the characterization of how different opinions were presented in class. It's true that as a class we did not really focus that much on identity politics or race (although we did read MLK, Du Bois, Fannon, and Amartya Sen), and we focused instead on themes such as political economy, moral philosophy, and liberalism. But that being said Professor John is definitely not a conservative (more of a moderate liberal) and is incredibly tolerant of differing viewpoints. We had people in our class who were very critical about the Core in general and they were able to voice their opinions freely and I was friends with a few of these people and they never felt like they were being penalized by speaking their mind. In conclusion, I highly recommend his class and I only wish there were more teachers here like him.

Easily the best professor I've had in college. Marten is both passionate and knowledgable, and surprisingly approachable. Lectures cover a lot of material but the papers are such that you don't need to talk about everything. Discussion sections really vary by TA, as does the grading scale, but it's not super hard to get a decent grade. Marten lectures and does PowerPoints, but the class was very engaging. 
Workload:
Reading can be heavy (~100 pages a week), but discussion section covers it nicely and Marten's lectures pre-empt the assigned reading material

Done with final, feel I have the right to write the review. 
First, let me say: 
Professor Xi Chen is so CUTE! 
In terms of the class, as people reviewed before me, he is rigorous about proof. He has pre-made slides, which could have some typos, but his lectures can be a little different. He is a good lecturer and very helpful during OH. 
Algo I covers a lot of topics in just one semester. If you think it's an upper level data structures class, then I want to tell you it's much more than that. It's like C++98 to C++17. I just want to say that we really learn a lot of different algorithms and the proofs about their correctness. 
The problem sets are mostly exercises from CLRS, our textbook. Some problems on them are doable, some are not (not for me, sad). I had to go to OHs to figure out where to start for some of the homework problems. Midterm and final are about the same difficulty but midterm was given shorter time. 
I'm not sure about grades, but the amount I learned is enough for me to not care. Although there are much more master students and a few PhDs, I think the number of undergrads taking this class is about 20. Very happy :)
Some advice:
read the textbook; it takes iterations (for me) to understand things. 
go to OH if you can; TAs are totally amazing, they see a problem and they solve it already. 
start the problem sets early because they could literally take 20+ hrs to do; I typed in latex which takes time too. 
Who might enjoy taking this class: love solving puzzles, when you get to know some underlying reason of how this works (usually related to math) you will get excited, can find connections between different concepts, want to rigorously prove something, etc. 
Prereq: I was doing okay without CS theory, but I would consider discrete math a must.

He has stellar course organization. Being an international student, I was worried whether my level of English writing was at par with the expected college standard (especially because I chose not to enroll in the UW section designed for international students). 
He is very prompt with emails and extremely helpful during office hours. He even reviewed my final draft of the fourth progression (op-eds) via email an hour before it was due. He was great at encouraging discussion and acknowledging student's efforts. He really wants the students to learn and taught us to use cool sites and software like Zotero, CLIO and GitHub (for posting weekly responses!). I got an A- in his class and that definitely boosted my confidence a lot.

Honestly, this is one of the best classes I've taken. I am a person who isn't all that fond of frequent class participation, and this is a class that involves a lot of participation, but Professor Eisendrath makes it seem so EASY. She is kind, thoughtful, and genuinely so so good at facilitating discussion. She considers everything everyone says so carefully and often helps you articulate the weird floating thoughts in your brain you didn't think were worth anything. Plus, she was super great about reading how we were feeling as a class. She could tell when we were tired, and would sometimes shift her plan for the day accordingly or just chat with us for a few minutes at the beginning of class to help us wake up. 
But beyond Professor Eisendrath being amazing, the class itself was so so interesting. There was a lot of reading, and a discussion post due weekly, but doing the reading was always worth it. I went into this class not knowing much about literary theory, and while I still don't know as much as many people, I do feel that working closely with texts that range from Aristotle to Walter Benjamin to Shakespeare to Freud has helped me think way more critically about what I read and how I read it. I also found the feedback I received on my paper really helpful and constructive, and the instruction we received before we even wrote the first paper really effective as well.
If you're considering an English major at Barnard and don't know which professor to take Critical Writing with -- take it with Professor Eisendrath. 
Workload:
weekly ~2 page discussion posts on Courseworks about the readings, two 5-7 page papers and a revision of one of them, and a slightly longer final paper (7-8 pages). Weekly readings -- usually a few essays by theorists, and then a slightly longer literary work. Probably ranged from 100-200 pages weekly.
