This is the best class I took in Barnard. Every issue you learn about - mass incarceration, welfare laws, legitimate ways of legal resistance, corporate law, legal pluralism and disobedience, among others - is interesting and relevant, and makes you think about the society in which we live in new ways. Deborah Becher will challenge you to really think about the readings in class discussions. The class is relatively small, so half of class time is lecture and half is more dicussion-style, but Professor Becher is happy to hear people's opinions about anything and everything and is always open to questions or comments. This is an important class to take if you are interested in the way that law and government work, and if you care about ideas of social justice.
The readings are generally long, but they are always interesting. You really need to do them in order to keep up with class discussion, and participation really matters in this class because Professor Becher will pay attention to who speaks and who doesn't. She knows everyone's names. 
The assignments are usually straightforward, based on the readings, and not long (around 3 pages each). The final is a couple general, broad questions about issues covered in class, and each answer should be 2-3 paragraphs. Not bad really.

Why Professor Mary Gordon does not have a gold nugget next to her name, I do not understand. I took this class my first year, and so far, no other English class here at Barnard/Columbia has lived up to it. Professor Gordon's lectures were intriguing and thought-provoking. I did not stop moving my pen to take notes, because everything she said was so pertinent and interesting! I still think about her lectures all the time. 
As a freshman taking this class, I was at first quite intimidated. However, I did not need to be. While the literature was definitely a challenge, Professor Gordon helped to make the works accessible to us. She understood that we would have difficulty with the literature and told us not to worry. When I arrived in class and listened to her lectures, the work magically seemed to make sense - I don't know how she did it! 
This is certainly a class that I will never forget, and I urge you to take this class or any class with Professor Gordon.

About a novel every three classes, difficult reading, but she understands that and does not expect you to come in having completely understood the work.

A 6-8 page paper (you don't really need to have read the books in their entireties if you attended class). A take home final (basically a 4-6 page essay) with a choice of 1 out of 2 prompts.

On the surface, Royden seems like the perfect professor: relaxed, engaging, knowledgeable....hip. Unfortunately, there's not much under the veneer of ""the cool grad student teaching a summer class"". 
The class is a blast. If you are a fan of DFW, you will love it. The main draw is interacting with the small class. Royden does a good job of facilitating discussion and adds a lot of insight which is not surprising since he has taught the class for like 5 summers.
If all you want is a deep reading of DFW and a good discussion section about his work, then you will get a lot out of this class. If you want to make yourself a better writer, a better close-reader, or get productive feedback on your work, this is not the class in which to do it.
Despite promises of feedback regarding our written work, specifically the final paper and take-home exam, Royden literally vanished when it came time to make good. In talking with others who took the class, I came to realize that I was not the only student whom he let down. He didn't respond to email (at all), he made mistakes when calculating grades, and seemingly doled out grades using a dartboard. I saw him on campus recently, and it was as if I had never taken the class: no recognition.
This is very disappointing since, from the beginning of the class, he presents himself as engaged and on top of things. I was ready for one of those transformative Columbia experiences, but ended up having one of those ""Oh, they don't really give a shit"" experiences that are also common here.
Keep our expectations low. You will get out of it exactly what you put into it, and your grade might reflect that. Who knows?

Lots of reading, but that's obvious. Short presentation , 2 page paper, 5 page paper, take-home final. Easy if you stay on top of the reading.

On top of everything noted already in reviews - an obsession with Frontiers, constant emailing, and a middle-school approach of teaching (think constant monitoring, repeatedly demanding you turn in assignments rather than treating you like an adult and get the grade you deserve, babysitting and helicoptering) - he's the most patronizing, condescending teacher I've ever encountered in my years of both public and private education. Never have I seen a teacher so passive-aggressive and with so little respect for his students who don't give 100% to the course. He must not only have an ego the size of the sun to believe his course should be everyone's #1 priority and to think so little of his students, and is either  a complete asshole or blatantly oblivious to his behavior. I would never speak so poorly of a professor in other circumstances, as I understand even the incompetent ones are often just trying to do their best - but NCB is not only an awful professor but a condescending, pathetic man. Avoid this course at all costs.

Professor Wolfe is simply brilliant. I came to her Elementary French I class having received no prior education in French, and just a year later I'm thinking of it as my second language. I've learned so unbelievably much in this short time, and I attribute that to her fabulous, nurturing personality and phenomenal teaching style. Prof Wolfe consistently creates some of the most comfortable classroom environments I've ever been in -- and that's saying a lot coming from a non-traditional (read: much older than average) student. I love how she encourages not only casual conversation and participation from everyone, but also rigorous engagement with French history and culture. Her efforts alone inspired me to study abroad and take her ""Paris In Context"" class -- in Paris!!! -- over this past summer. Of course, my life has been forever changed. 
I can't imagine how different my summer would have been without ""Paris in Context,"" as the curriculum curated an intimate introduction to the city through engagement with museum exhibitions, historical monuments, restaurants, music, night life, traditional summer events, the list goes on. Each week, Prof Wolfe split the class into small rotating groups assigned to 9 or 10 eclectic city visits. We then presented on different aspects of our collective visits, mainly through subjective responses, current events, and critical French literature. This was my first experience with a French ""elective"" outside of my language requirement, and I was challenged in terribly frustrating and invariably motivational ways. There were many moments when my skills weren't advanced enough to communicate my ""very collegiate level"" ideas on the social world, so the class pushed me to new levels of expression and a general commitment to progress and master more of the nuances that come with French. This is a fun and critical course for a serious student who's willing to put in the time and energy it takes to engage with the material and offer meaningful contributions to discussions (and also visit ALL the amazingly dreamy parts of Paris as a requirement).
It could be easy to feel like the underdog in language courses at Columba/Barnard, but Prof Wolfe effectively teaches to every level in the class. Not once have I ever felt that I couldn't figure out a tricky grammar rule or tackle a written response to a lengthy article in French. Everyone should experience a professor like her! She's also one of the sweetest, most understanding people I know, who cares so much about her students' absorption and enjoyment of the language and always takes the extra time to make sure we're really grasping the material. I would go on and on but I think you're getting the point. Regardless of your level of exposure to or proficiency with French, take her class! If you're considering studying abroad in Paris, take her class! Even if you don't go to Barnard and are nervous about learning a new language with traditional-aged students, take her class! You will have no regrets, you will leave with a deeper passion for the language and culture, you will feel more accomplished, inspired, and smarter than before you started, I promise.  

Workload:
Rigorous but not too strenuous, typical of all languages at Columbia. Being consistent is key -- an hour a day of language practice, a text to work through and discuss every week, vocab and/or grammar quizzes every few weeks, midterm, final. If you do a little bit each day, you will progress with ease and should do quite well. She's also amazing for one-on-one coaching during office hours. Take her class!

Ashley Tuttle is the best! Not only is she a fantastic dancer (just the little bits of demonstration in class totally give away her perfect turn-out and ridiculous extension), but she is a fantastic teacher, and pretty much just a fantastic human being all around. Allow me to elaborate:
She teaches a very demanding but very rewarding class. Her combinations are sophisticated and purposeful, and she always gives corrections. You might not get a personal note every class, but she gives feedback to the whole room after almost every exercise and walks around the room throughout the class so that she can look at various dancers more closely and from different angles. Her attention never wavers. She is always completely present, and always seems over-the-moon enthusiastic about ballet and about explaining it in new ways.
My favorite thing about Ashley is her attitude. One of the first things she said to my class was that we needed to show more joy in our dancing (actually, her exact words were: ""I mean, isn't this better than chemistry?""). As dancers, I think we often feel like the fun will come later as long as we work hard now. But Ashley refuses to let any amount of hard work take the joy out of dancing. It's like her life philosophy, I guess (and she is happy to talk to you about life if you ask). She tells us to give a gift with our developes, to relax our faces when we pirouette, etc. but the most important thing is that she smiles and jokes throughout class and keeps the atmosphere buoyant. It is really impossible to leave her class in a bad mood, even though it is so hard!
And that brings me to my last point: I am not one of the best dancers in ballet VI. In fact, I may be one of the worst (but I like to take classes that challenge me and in which there are dancers I can try to emulate, so that's why I take this level). The dangers inherent to a situation like this are a) that you will leave class feeling badly about yourself every time, and b) that the teacher will resent you for taking a class you can't quite keep up with. 
BUT! Like I said before, it is impossible to leave Ashley's class in a bad mood. And she does not resent you (or, er, me) for trying your best in a class that is slightly above your level. She will never give you those scornful you'll-never-be-worthy-of-ballet eyes that so many ballet teachers (especially those with her kind of talent) are pros at dishing out. She won't make you feel like an idiot for wanting something that you might not ever totally achieve. She'll just help you along your way. She'll even give you as much attention as she gives the best dancer in the room, as long as you are putting in 110% of your effort every time you walk into the studio.
Workload:
Standard technique class, meaning no outside work is assigned. However, Ashley makes clear that she expects everyone to work their absolute hardest during class. Also, at this level, it seems to be expected that students are taking more than just this one dance class and that they have some kind of stretching/strengthening built into their personal routines.

I loved this class and it really pushed me to become a sociology major.
Pretty standard lecture with powerpoint slides that follow along, but don't necessarily outline everything she's saying. She helps review and break down the readings and highlights the points that are most important to understand and how to connect them to other readings. If she says something twice, it's important. It's pretty obvious. Because her lectures are clear and insightful, if you do most of the readings and come to class and listen you should do pretty well, as long as you use your brain. No wild curveballs on midterm or final. 
Although the class is mostly lecture she'll also sometimes spend 15-20 minutes just having a discussion or having people share their personal experiences
Overall, this class was awesome. She doesn't take any BS and knows and teaches her subject well.

If Campbell continues to teach Uwriting, whoever gets him should consider themselves lucky. Campbell is a PhD candidate in the English department of the Graduate School of Arts and Science and from Auckland, New Zealand. He is witty, funny and probably one of the more helpful professors/TAs I've encountered since I've gotten to Columbia. He is really understanding about anything that you talk with him about, extremely lenient in regards to being in class on time (8:40-9:55 is a nightmare), and super reachable in his office hours/email. He has made Uwriting significantly less worse than all the hellish things you might've heard about. He seems to be a decent grader too!

Eguchi-sensei is amazing! I absolutely love starting my day with his energy, enthusiasm, and clarity. In a school full of lecturers and professors who seem to not care, the foreign language department has always stood out -- Eguchi-sensei is the epitome of a good language teacher! 
Not only does he legitimately care about his students, but he legitimately cares about learning. Yes, the pace is rather brisk, but Eguchi-sensei's teaching style (methodical, organized, routine-based) makes it enjoyably so. 
While he does call on people to answer questions, he doesn't make it intimidating. There are a lot of verbal drills in class where you work in pairs or groups. Eguchi-sensei makes it clear he wants us to develop fluency in the language in all senses of the word. 
The vocab/grammar quizzes aren't bad. As long as you focus in class, all you're left studying is memorizing the vocab for the next day (10-15 words). The homework is usually a worksheet and, once in awhile, an accompanying blog post, plus verbal exercises. None of it takes too long so long as you've paid attention to the lesson. 
Overall, if you get the chance, I highly, HIGHLY recommend taking Japanese with Eguchi-sensei! He's amazing for people who (like me) have no prior Japanese/character language experience and he's an endearing teacher with a great personality! 
Workload:
Daily quizzes (10-15 vocab words possible; half appear on the quiz in Japanese and you translate to English, the other half are in English and you translate to Japanese + grammar fill-in-the-blank style)

God bless Jill Shapiro. She is everything a professor should be, and she genuinely cares about her students and about the subjects she teaches. I've found that her advanced courses require a lot of dedication and interest on the part of the student, but if you put time into learning the facts then you will be just fine. 
 Explorations in Primate Anatomy is a wonderful course which focuses mainly on the skeletal system of extant primates. It is structured like a guided bone lab with intermittent lectures throughout, which I found was the perfect mix of hands-on and theoretical learning needed for an anatomy course. I actually found this to be the most challenging class I had taken with Professor Shapiro due to the amount of memorization required, but by the end we had all learned an immense amount about comparative primate anatomy, and had an awesome time doing it.
The Biology, Systematics, and Evolutionary History of the Apes (or Apes, Apes, Apes as everyone calls it) is a mix between a small seminar and a lecture. While it requires a thorough breadth of knowledge, I found it a bit easier to handle in terms of studying than Primate Anatomy. Of course, Professor Shapiro's passion for the subject (and particularly Orangutans!) shines bright in this course, making the learning experience that much more worth it. The workload was completely manageable, but be aware that you can not get away with not doing the reading in such a small class! The best part: Professor Shapiro brought snacks to class every week.
Workload:
I thought it was a bit heavier for Primate Anatomy: 
-Weekly readings that could sometimes be dense
-A midterm that requires a very thorough/exact answers to each question, particularly in the short and long answer form. 
-A short but well-researched write-up where we do an anatomical examination of a chosen primate.
-8-10 page term paper on any topic of interest relating to primate anatomy
-Hard final with the same sort of thoroughness required for the midterm.
For Apes:
-Readings for each class which range drastically in subject, density, and even era!
-A fun short review on a pop-sci primate book (she gives you a list of books to choose from) that is generously graded.
-An 8-10 page term paper which you have to spend a lot of time on. The good thing is that you can basically choose any topic you want as long as it pertains to the Apes. 
-An essay based final which required a thorough knowledge of everything learned in class and in the readings. Seriously. It's hard but if you keep up in class and take the time to use the study guides and advice she gives you, then you'll be just fine. I got an A and so can you. :)

Professor Pfeiffer is a nice guy--energetic and enthusiastic about the subject matter. The plays we read covered most if not all of Shakespeare's genres: comedy, tragedy, romance and history. Obviously some were more enjoyable than others. The class was pretty discussion-based, although the professor definitely does most of the talking. There were some students who got away with hardly ever talking (I don't know what their grades were though) and I managed to skip reading one play, and was totally fine.
I enjoyed this class, but I feel I should give others a warning about the very heavy work load and time commitment. We were required to read about 2 plays a week and there were many assignments: go to and review a play; prepare a presentation; two detailed annotations (same amount of work as an essay); a quiz; a final paper. This was all in the 5-week summer course, so it amounted to reading two plays and writing a paper each week. This class took up absolutely ALL of my time. I am not an English major, but I have been reading and studying Shakespeare since 7th grade. Because of this class, I had to drop other classes I had planned to take that summer, which was very frustrating.
Even though I like the professor and it is nice to be Shakespeare-literate, I am not sure I would whole-heartedly recommend this class unless you are very interested in Shakespeare and don't mind it taking up all your time. I just needed an English credit, so I wish i had taken a less work-intensive class. I did receive an A (I do not think he is a difficult grader), so if you are willing to put in all the necessary time, you will be rewarded.

I highly recommend this First Year Seminar. We read fun and interesting novels/poems/short stories/plays such as ""Into the Woods,"" ""Alice and Wonderland,"" ""Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"" ""Lord of the Rings,"" and assorted fairytales, and have interesting and thought-provoking discussions about the works in class.
 Professor Pagano is best teacher I've had so far. He is brilliant, kind, and understanding; he offers excellent insight during class discussions and makes you think about literature and life in a different way. You will never look at fairytales the same way again. He is also encouraging and never shoots down your ideas during class. As long as you participate and seem to show interest in the readings, you will have no trouble at all. He also lets you revise your essays as many times as you want with constant feedback, so if you work hard, you will definitely receive an ""A"" in this class. 
Basically, this class is fun, awesome, and perfect in every way. I've become a better writer, reader, and person because of FYS Enchanted Imagination. You should definitely take it!

The biggest mistake I made my freshman year was lookup Mark Lilla's (then with a golden nugget) reviews and choose his class. Mark Lilla asks his students to write CULPA reviews which makes it much more likely that students who are partial to him write him good reviews.
Grades  : Mark Lilla is not the kind of teacher you want if you want good grades. Very biased, judges on style (subjective) rather than on content. He is also very partial to specific people, as one might observe during class.
Content : Mark Lilla is very opinionated. He will only teach what he think is right, and he will only focus on the part of the text that he is interested in. Any questions leading to some other topic, regardless of how important it may be, will be dismissed.
Workload: Mark Lilla's ridiculously enormous sense of self importance about himself and his class makes him assign a massive amount of work that he expects to be done with top priority.
Given that, there are some students who do well in that class and those students are very specific to Mark Lilla's taste, and there is not really much of a correlation between whether they are good writers or not. Mark Lilla is very paternally condescending and demeaning, which does make some students worship him, but overall makes his class unpleasant.

Prof Miller is absolutely amazing and I would (and do!) recommend both her and this class to everyone who asks. She is an utter delight, extremely approachable, and possibly the nicest and most well-meaning professor I've encountered in my time here. The texts she chooses are gripping and insightful to the period and its various movements, and she is always sure to sprinkle in historically relevant details that pertain to the works we read. She is (obviously) intelligent, witty, and passionate.
The class I was in was in the morning and so often her questions were met with silence, which was disappointing, but that's the fault of the class, not the professor. Miller somehow managed to make a subject I'd always been interested in even better, more approachable, more manageable, etc. Although the class was very heavy in reading (it's an English course, so that should be expected), it never seemed insurmountable because of the quality of the works she'd selected; frankly put, it never really seemed a chore to do the readings for this class, and for that I am thankful.

Get in someone else's class if you can. She assigns so much homework online and in the grammar book. Also, in the grammar book, you can't just bring your book to class and let her check it- you have to write it in your book, scan it, then upload it to Courseworks by midnight. It's such a hassle, and she gets easily annoyed if something goes wrong in uploading it. She doesn't care if you can open your grammar book and show her you did it. Like the last reviewer said, she laughs all time and no one knows why. That was cool with me in the beginning, but I started to notice that sometimes she would be laughing at the way some people spoke Spanish. If they used the wrong words or said it really slowly or something, she would giggle at them. Lastly, I noticed that a lot of people in my class had no idea what was going on most of the time because of the way she taught. The most common example of this in her class was she would speak super fast and then stare at us. We would stare back.Finally we would figure out that she had just told us to do some activity, but literally no one understood her well enough to know what to do initially.

He really cares about his students and the subject he teaches, and is completely friendly and open to further conversations about anything, class related or not. I like that during class discussions, unlike a lot of teachers here who just ask the students pretentious questions and expect them to competitively continue on, he interjects with really brilliant thoughts and interesting questions.
