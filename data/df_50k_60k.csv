Really surprised that neither this course nor Frank Nitsche have been reviewed. This class has three parts - the first two portions of the class use excel to perform statistical analysis and then the third covers ArcMap. Like most stats classes, I imagine, they start off pretty easy with mode/range terms and a few concepts get tough pretty quickly. In this class, it is possible to get by - and I mean get an A - purely on memorizing the statistical operations as Frank provides pretty substantial class notes via Courseworks. That being said, Frank is also very helpful and receptive to students that really want to understand. In fact, that seems like Frank's M.O. He's a very sweet professor, arguably a bit dry at times, but he means well and will give back to you exactly what you put in. I took this class because it was required, but it ended up being rather enjoyable for what it was. Also, it's a good way to get to know other folks in environmental departments - a lot of Columbia Sus Dev majors, Barnard environmental policy, etc.

Cindy Gorn is a very cool person and her classroom environment is one of mutual respect between her and her students. As a result, this is not a stressful class because Cindy is very understanding. 
Notice that this course is called GIS: Methods & Case Studies. I didn't really know what that meant when I enrolled, but it means that beyond learning the technical aspect of GIS, you read and discuss the process involved in making maps. It's not the most interesting thing to me, but it's definitely a respectable field that everyone can comment on in one way or another. Also, since this is an intro-level GIS class that focuses on the mapmaking process rather than purely results, if certain portions of your case studies (essentially labs) don't come out the way you intended, you only need to explain what happened. 
Overall, I am very happy that I took this course and so pleased that I waited to take this with Cindy. She is adjunct professor and I don't know how long she will be around, but if you get the opportunity to take this class from her, I definitely recommend it. 

Workload:

This course is an awesome take for anyone interested in criminal justice, community organizing, immigration, or pretty much any field that has intersections with the law and race & ethnicity. In any given class you'll be discussing multiple federal cases in depth but OuYang is more interested in the forest than the trees. She wants you to have a good understanding of the legal reasoning behind the case, of course but wants you to put it in the context of the history of race & ethnicity in America (past & present) and its relationship to the constitution and courts. She's a strong believer in the power of community organizing and often says that even if a lawyer's legal reasoning is correct (that they have an ""ace in the hole"" so to speak) it is difficult to achieve major victories without the force of public opinion. As an immigration and disabilities lawyer herself (not to mention the President of the Organization of Chinese Americans - NY) she can point to numerous examples of this happening in practice.
All in all the readings are enjoyable and the discussions are engaging. If law and its relationship to social justice interest you this is a course you should take.

Readings can be dense but pretty enjoyable if you enjoy reading SCOTUS cases. Assignments and readings are definitely manageable too.

EMMA IS THE BEST
I am currently taking Emma (since she's a Ph.D. candidate she would rather be called by her first name rather than Professor) for University Writing but I've decided to write a review since many people are getting ready to register for classes.
University Writing is one of those classes that we are all required to take and many people thread this but taking class with Emma has been both productive and engaging. She's very approachable, understanding and overall an extremely sweet person. Her readings are all interesting which makes it easier when writing the papers. Her feedback is always precise and clear so take advantage of her office hours!!

As soon as I started going and paying attention beginning to end, I was really really really happy I did. He is a great guy with a strong grasp of material.

Professor Amar is an incredible teacher! After having taken CC with him I chose to take his Soviet Cinema course and couldn't be happier that I did. The films he picks are incredibly interesting and his vast (almost unsettlingly so) knowledge of soviet history and culture is actually incredible. He is an expert as well in Ukranian history and gives you interesting insights into current events.  He has a quirky sense of humor so expect to be treated to the occasional Stalin joke. His perspective on grading seems to be that if you show interest and put in the time you deserve to do well. As a result everyone in his class seems relaxed and genuinely enthused by the material and does the work out of sincere interest in the course rather than out of panic that they will fail. A really nice and knowledgable professor and a very interesting course overall! I second other reviewers opinions when I say this man is a gem!

This Professor is THE WORST PROFESSOR EVER.
She would never give review on your essays, she will give feedback after you the deadline, she is so confusing. Your class will grow a bond after hating her for 3 months. You will not get an A, because A is for people who can write like Fitzgerald. 
Be prepared to never never get any feedback. She is often late, and will make you wait in class to compensate for the time loss, as if it was the class' fault.

Guada an incredible professor, hands down. For one, she's absolutely hilarious, and is very concerned with keeping the whole class engaged. We watched all sorts of youtube videos, movies, listened to songs, etc. We went on field trips to museums and movie screenings, too! 
She does tend to speak quickly, and sometimes it takes a moment or two for your brain to process what it is that she's saying, but overall i had little trouble understanding her. Tons of fun group work. There's also a lot of useless textbook homework that no one ever does (or needs to do!) and it's never reviewed in class.

While the material of this class is fascinating, I hate it. Professor Gyger writes her entire lectures before coming to class; this makes it feel like she is reading you a paper instead of giving a lecture. She speaks incredibly quickly, using very large vocabulary, making her impossible to follow. More than that, she moves through hundreds of slides a lecture, pointing out obvious features of buildings, never speaking about what actually matters. This makes the papers the TA's assign extremely difficult to write; you haven't actually learned anything.

Elaine is the kind of Professor that can translate and transfer her love and interest in a topic to her students.  I am a musician who knew very little about opera.  I decided to take her class and was drawn into her world of drama and music.  She encouraged class discussions that were lively and critical but as intimate as fireside chats.  We viewed videos of very diverse operas, read excerpts from the lives of composers, opera divas and even set-designers and costumers. I was motivated to attend a performance by one of the students given at Barnard.  Because of this class, I had a greater depth of understanding and enjoyment of the music.

Rabinowitz is a great professor. He does tend to drift a little during class, which can be frustrating, especially if you're worried about your grade. However, his exam scheme was very fair and the scores fit the curve well. 
The best thing about his teaching is that he makes the material very interesting. He contextualizes the mathematical side of statistics with phenomena from the world, often getting a bit philosophical.

If you want to learn how to paint in a technically proficient way, this class is not for you. If you're looking for a chill atmosphere where you are pushed to complete paintings because you have difficulty carving out time in your schedule to paint, go for it. The syllabus does provide suggestions, but Joan emphasizes that you're free to do what you want. One thing I wish I knew going in was that you're expected to purchase all of your own materials. This was the first painting class I've taken here, and I was surprised that the department doesn't at least provide you with canvases. The cost of it is pretty high if you don't intend on taking more art classes in the future, considering you'll have to spend over $100 or so for the basic oil paints and canvases. I guess I'm learning by doing, but there is basically no instruction given from the professor; she and her assistant make their rounds during the 4-hour block, but they stop and chat for no more than 10 minutes, tops. Outside work is definitely expected to finish everything by the end of the semester; she doesn't give deadlines besides that.

He tends to dominate the discussion which can be annoying, but at 8:40 in the morning everyone is basically asleep anyway.

He doesn't really know what he is doing. He seems like he has never taught an Intro Econ course before, and he was terrible at explaining micro concepts. He is much better at teaching macro, as that is his specialty.  He goes off on tangents all the time and spends way too long on simple concepts and then breezes over more complicated ones. I know this was his first semester teaching this class at Barnard, so hopefully he will get better. I say stay away until he figures out how to teach this class more effectively. On a side note, this is a really easy class if you already know Econ but the school wouldn't take your AP credit so you have to take it again.

Professor Williams is truly brilliant! He is always exceptionally well-prepared for class and takes class very seriously. In this class we read Catullus, Propertius, Tibullus, and lots of Ovid. Williams' definitely prefers Ovid out of all of these authors, but spent quite a bit of time on all of them, except Tibullus. We actually ended up reading far less than was on the syllabus, and therefore spent a lot of time on each poet and poem. 
Williams truly has a gift when it comes to the Latin language and that is evident as he teaches the course. He will periodically ask students grammatical questions, but never puts anyone on the spot. Nor does he take attendance, but why would you ever not want to go?

Professor Morris is a fantastic human being. Her course was great too! Essentially, this class covers Egyptian history from the Late Period to Late Antiquity. This course has a great deal of depth despite the broad scope. We discussed social, political, religious, and identity issues that the Egyptians faced throughout history under the power of the Assyrians, Nubian Kushites, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. Professor Morris also has an extensive knowledge of Egyptian archaeology and knows the Ancient Egyptian language as well. 
As her main area of interest is the New and Middle Kingdom of Egypt, there were definitely lapses in her knowledge in some areas. She also didn't have knowledge of Latin or Greek, but that is because she's really an Egyptologist, not really a Classicist. I was still impressed by the amount of scholarship and primary sources we read, so she had clearly learned much about the subject.

Professor Marka was without question the nicest, most enthusiastic, most sincere guy I've ever met, let alone Columbia professor. He is BRILLIANT, immensely warm and understanding. He has a bit of a thick accent, but, at least for me, that made him all the more endearing. He asks very little of you for this class (not even that you show up most of the time), but if you do give him even a little bit of energy and/or curiosity, you will be rewarded in spades. Not only is he more than willing to give you a good grade for relatively little work, but he teaches amongst the most interesting and under-discussed courses at CU. WMDs is simply fascinating, and his enthusiasm is infectious. Don't worry about not being a scientist! He doesn't give the greatest explanations in the world of the complex scientific phenomena covered in this class, but they are serviceable, and you really don't need to understand it all--just get the essentials of how whatever he is describing works and you'll be fine (his explanations should be more than clear enough for you to do this). Moreover, though the class opens with some technical, dry explanations of nuclear reactions, it quickly moves on to a broader discussion of nuclear technologies that will appeal to anyone from political scientists, historians, and human rights majors to environmental scientists and engineers.
I really cannot say enough nice things about this class and Professor Marka. This class was the most interesting class and (surprisingly because there is no work) amongst the most informative classes I've taken at Columbia. If ever a professor deserved a gold-nugget, it is Marka. He is simply the best. Definitely do yourself a favor and take WMDs.

Andreas is quite literally the best teacher I have had at Columbia so far. 
Brief bio - he's from Cyprus, and is brilliant. I mean brilliant. He's a PhD candidate in political theory, and he specialized in Plato, so he know his shit, and he communicates his knowledge EXTREMELY well. I have learned so much from this class.
However, he is formidable, and he doesn't take bullshit. You have to do ALL the reading, because he has a lottery system at the beginning of every class where he pulls your name from a hat, and if you're called you have to give a 5 minute lecture on the points of the reading. Also, he calls on random people in class, and he can tell when you're bullshitting and he will call you out in front of everyone, because he's dead serious about the text. You have to come into this class well prepared, and thought out if you want to do well. Overall, if you keep up with the reading, prepare questions in advance, and go to office hours when you have questions about the text, you will gain SO MUCH from this class. If you're prepared and you ask him for help, you will do well. But this is not a class for the faint-hearted. You HAVE to put in all your effort.

Gustavo Perez-Firmat is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, professors I have had at Columbia. I decided to take his class because I have a genuine interest in short stories by Latin American writers, and he did not disappoint with his extensive knowledge of the authors, the texts, the cultures in which the works were written and the historical context for each story as well. Not only was he knowledgeable about the texts in our class, he has also read virtually all types of literature extensively, frequently quoting from the likes of William Wordsworth or Franz Kafka. His doctoral work is in Comparative Literature, so he can read (but not speak; he also explains that he ""used"" to read all of these languages very well, but he still has a knowledge of all of the following) Latin, German, French, and Portuguese, which makes the class super interesting because he uses words in other languages to explain certain sentiments that the stories evoke and he connects words in Spanish with their counterparts in French or German as well, giving them a different reading that a student may not have . 
Yet perhaps most impressive is that despite Professor Perez-Firmat's impressive and extensive knowledge, he is by no means pretentious-in fact, quite the opposite. He is welcoming, warm, engaging, and fair. He does not dismiss any idea too radical, but he does gently disagree if he feels that someone has misinterpreted some part of the text. While he is capable of quoting Ernest Hemingway from memory, in the same breath he could use a quote from the Indiana Jones franchise to equate to a phenomenon in the text. Take the time to read his website and get to know more about his works before you take his class. He is a fascinating human being.

Great super cute old guy but tends to ramble during class about his adorable home life and wife rather than actual material. I found this class to be particularly easy since it did not need calc and I barely took math in high school. As an athlete I seriously enjoyed being able to skip whenever because you teach yourself the material from the book, his slides on Courseworks and homework - not the lecture. 
Definitely recommend if you're looking for a large lecture thats chill and not much work involved.

The first day I walked into bio lab I thought this semester was going to be HELL in lab, but I really ended up liking Wanda. The first day she came off as a total bitch and I was scared to say the least. However labs 2-9 she was nothing but wonderful. She is a very knowledgeable woman and very intelligent and she explains things VERY WELL! (far better than my lecturer professor Hertz). I don't know why she seemed rude the first lab, but she was never that way the rest of the time. She smiled and made jokes proving that she is not a stuck up bitch as the semester went on. Her grading on assignments was very fair. I only got a B on each lab report but I don't think that is terrible.Her corrections made perfect sense and the points I got off were definitely my own fault.Unlike other lab professors, Wanda very clearly describes what she wants EXACTLY in her lab reports (i'm talking she tells you exactly what words to use in each sentence for each section). Each time we had a lab report due she would spend an hour going over what we needed to do on the lab report.This made the lab reports a no brainer. I would actually highly recommend Knauss. I learned way more from her than my friends who have other lab professors. I'm not sure why she has such scathing reviews from the past, but I am here to tell you that you do not need to worry. Trust me I was terrified the first day but I felt very comfortable from then on and I think it is easy to ask her questions and she is always very helpful.

Can't say I was a huge fan of professor Hertz, but he is alright! His lectures are hit or miss. Sometimes they are very interesting while other times you really could have just stayed in your dorm and done the book work. This class does require that you keep up with the reading. It is very important that you stay on top of the reading!Professor Hertz does not allow you to ask questions during class because there is not enough time. SI sessions are offered with this course though if you have questions. I never went to an SI sessions so I am not sure if they are helpful. Overall, I felt Hertz was kinda mediocre. that is just honest opinion. He's not bad, but not excellent either. He is clearly a very intelligent man and even wrote the textbook for the course, but I don't think he's the best lecturer.

Overall I found it to be a pretty interesting class and Stanislawski helps foster discussion. His humor helped keep us awake in our 9 am section so that was definitely a plus. He's not super strict in terms of class participation, it can only boost your grade, not lower it. So if you're not much of a talker, don't fret! 
Professor Stanislawski is very knowledgeable and because of that he's quite the chatterbox. Often times he'll forget to give us a break because he's too much into our debate or giving us background info on our text. Although he encourages you to disagree with him and engage in open debates, he'll often talk over students which is annoying at times. So the solution is just to continue talking so that he knows you're not done. When you get to the religious texts, he'll question them from a historical stand point so don't be offended when he questions the basis of your religious foundations (if you are religious). He's not insensitive to people's beliefs, he just questions the texts like any academic would, and this can make some people uncomfortable so just make him aware of that in class. 
Aside from that I enjoyed my time in this class and would recommend him to others if for no other reason than that the midterm and final are open note and book. Also, he doesn't believe in pop quizzes so you won't ever have to worry about a reading quiz in his class. 

Workload:

Gundgodu is a great professor.  She is very welcoming, supportive, and helpful when you need it. Unlike many of the TA's , she welcomes your opinions (even if they consist of incorrect interpretation of the text) and is excited to answer any questions you may have.  
Although this is an intro level course, don't expect easy material.   There are a lot of weekly readings, which are not light reads!  They are chalk full of meaning, so you literally cannot skip anything.  Gundogdu really helps though!  Her lectures clarify all the important parts of the books/articles that you read in the class.

Professor Franzese is one of the most incredible professors at Columbia University. You can read below about her style of teaching, which she has improved upon since many of these reviews were written (quicks are actually quick now, better at cutting people off, etc). 
To the points of not learning anything: absolutely ridiculous. You get as much out of this class as you put into it. It's not the most *content* heavy class in the world, but there is extreme value in fleshing out ideas and articulating them in new ways. Also, exploring the relationships between theory, case law, and normative messages in American society is a worthwhile endeavor. There's a lot to be learned and even more to be gained from taking this class.

This class is legendary for a good reason. The assignments are long, the material difficult, the exams are incredibly tricky bordering on unfair. However if you get through it you will have learned as much in this course as self-taught programmers may learn in years, if ever. I write this from a perspective of someone who took this course with basically zero knowledge of computer science or programming experience coming into this class. 
What the class covers really well: C.
What the class will force you to learn by sheer force: the UNIX environment, working with a shell, basic git commands, how memory works under the hood, and more C than you ever care to know, and then some.
What is briefly touched upon: multi-threaded programming through blocking functions, sockets/networks, and basic under the hood stuff for C++.
Jae begins the semester with the claim that he'll turn students of programming into actual programmers which sounds like an ambitious task but he pulls it off fairly well. By the end of the class, you will have coded a linked list in C, written your own web server, and some minimal C++ experience, all of which isn't that impressive on paper. However, the skills you learn here will be applicable to nearly any job you hold as a computer programmer unless it's really implementation-heavy front end stuff. Even then, you will come away with experience of having to read lots of documentation with very little guidance on how to use it, which is expected of all programmers. 
If you want to do programming as a career and are debating taking this class because of the grading, take it anyway. You'll learn a lot more than you think regardless of your grade. He grades to a A- and in my semester he curved everyone to at least a C-. I did terribly on my first exam and still eked out a B+.
This is sort of a requirement: get to know your TAs really well. They are all super helpful, smart, and were probably the reason I didn't drop out after failing my first midterm. They really make or break your experience in the class. 
Workload:
Heavy. 10 labs, 1 optional, 7 free-form late days, no more than 2 per lab. 
2 midterms, 1 final, all impressively crazy. 
I wouldn't take this and Data Structures at the same time if you're looking to take your programming skills to the next level. Both professors warned me not to do it; I did it anyway and I managed to survive, but I was only taking 10 credits. Still I wouldn't recommend it. Take 3134 or the honors Data Structures first before taking this class if possible.

This class is very neutral. Professor Hamilton isn't a bad professor, I just wouldnt say there is anything too special about her. The class is about an hour and half and is primarily discussion based. That being said, your discussions revolve around one person: Professor Hamilton. While in discussion, you will not discuss amongst other students rather be completely led by Prof. Hamilton which makes for a very slow and dry class. This is not a class in which you will do an excessive amount of reading, most nights would take me only a half hour to read the assigned pages.
Grade Breakdown:
-Papers are averaged, meaning your draft, yes DRAFT, is averaged with your final paper
-Research paper component that does not receive a true draft grade, however, you cannot get a score higher than one letter grade above your draft.
-Small participation grade
My biggest problem with this class is the grading. If you are a type of person who procrastinates, this class wouldn't be for you. Because your drafts are averaged with your final paper score, you will end up with a mediocre grade even if you do a stellar job on your final paper. She loves papers that cater to HER writing style and believes that the best papers are ones that are structured in a very high-school level way.
Overall: You will survive if you have this class. If you want her to like you, make sure you speak up in class and show that you actually read the material.

Dear Culpa: Where is this woman's golden nugget?!?
But seriously - Professor Ullman's colloquium - Everything from the way the syllabus is crafted, to her thoughtful comments on papers, to the way she leads discussion - Shows that she cares deeply for her students, and that she truly understands them.  I didn't just learn in her class. I grew as a person, as a writer and a critical thinker.  She is funny, engaging and knows how to lead a discussion.  She goes above and beyond other professors to help you succeed in her class.  This is the kind of class that you will look forward to each week and will kind of weirdly dread ending at the end of the semester despite the promise of holiday cheer that awaits you when the semester ends.  
She is the rare and perfect confluence of brilliant scholar and brilliant teacher. If you have the chance to take anything she teaches, I cannot recommend that you do so enough. 
Workload:
Normal for colloquium.  Lengthy, but very interesting and thoughtfully assigned readings each week, 4 discussion papers for that week's readings (but you can write more than that and she will only factor in your 4 best grades to your final grade - amazing), participation and the 30 page research paper.  She really expects it to be 30 pages, while most other colloquia say 20-30.  She also wants a draft of your research paper, which makes it kind of stressful but is ultimately better for your grade and your end of semester sanity.

This is one of the best classes I have taken at Columbia.  
The texts Professor Tyerman chose to cover were perfect. Each is, of course, a classic and so alone is powerful to read and discuss, on top of this the class traced themes through each novel, linking them all together and exploring a powerful literary movement and a culture in turmoil. 
The class is taught in a directed discussion format, which worked really well. Most students participated, but it was up to each student as an individual to decide how much they contributed. The professor came to class exceedingly prepared with notes and so the discussion went in very interesting directions. It would have been nice to have more time to explore some of the longer texts - just because we didn't always have time to get to the more subtle points of discussion - but I suppose that's unavoidable.
There was a weekly discussion posting in response to a posted question. The question was always open ended and very interesting. The professor or the TA respond to each post. Also the TA, Ben Lussier, was great.
Outside of class Professor Tyerman is very accessible and willing to further discuss the texts. He obviously cared a lot for the class and it showed. I would definitely recommend taking this class and any other class that Professor Tyerman teaches. 
Workload:
Reasonable. There is a lot of reading, but it's very engaging. The volume of reading is off-set by the lack of essays. There is a weekly discussion post which has a short minimum, and most people write a lot more than they have to. There is also a midterm and a final. I can't speak for the final at this time, but the midterm was in the form of passage ids of specific passages we coved in class with analysis plus 1 or 2 (I can't remember) short essays.

It's been a while since I hated a professor this much. 
When talking about justice in society, she put up three pictures of different people to show a pay gap between different economic classes. While the two lower-paid professions were stock photos, the ""hedge fund manager"" was an actual person with his name listed, and I quote Professor Sparrow: ""I hope he drops dead soon."" ""Hedge fund managers make me... ugh *shivering motion*"".""His face looks kinda weird, maybe he'll have a heart attack or something.""
Not only was this (and similar instances) irrelevant to psychology, but it was one of the most unprofessional things I've ever had the displeasure to witness. 
She's also pretty unpleasant as a person - if you came to talk to her after class she would be quite abrupt and just seemed like she wanted you out of her face. 
About the course: very much a SURVEY course, a lot of general information to be memorized. Granted, the content is very interesting and I enjoyed learning it, but don't expect any in-depth analysis.
No textbook, also, which is nice.

This class was miserable. Zeitlin will cover material straight from the textbook, using verbatim examples in his lectures. I liked to be physically shown the steps to the examples so I went to class, but I never got any extra insight from the textbook. Another frustrating part of the class is that the homework problems are identical to the rest of the Calculus 3 classes as far as textbook exercises go, but his exams feature more geometrical and conceptual examples that his homework fail to cover and that he also fails to cover in his cursory overview of the basic textbook examples. You can study for the exams, but unless you have a crystal ball, knowing just the concepts won't be enough. If you have a solid background in the course (i.e. have taken a multivariable calculus class before) then you probably can manage this class, but if this is your first time like it was for me, I would look to a different professor. 
Zeitlin seems like a nice guy on the surface because he wears a t-shrt and jeans to class and makes jokes, but when it comes to answering questions in class, he expects what he considers the simplest things to go unquestioned and dismisses any questions about them in a belittling manner. What should be simple, however, is not because his teaching style is vague and unorganized. Without reading the textbook before, class would just seem like a jumbled mess of problems for which he offers no explanation.

I had him last year for Lit Hum and he got about 75% of our class to actively engage in discussions, and thats saying a lot when there are usually only a couple of people talking in Lit Hum. I'd take another class with him teaching since he is very enthusiastic and prepared.
He was very straightforward in what he expected in essays and on tests, and he is a pretty fair grader. You can't BS your way through essays though, I highly suggest you do the reading.

This was Professor Zeitlin's first time teaching Calculus III, and let's say that it ""really showed"". I'll trust the previous reviewers who raved about his Calc I course, but I found his Calc III lectures to be pretty unpleasant. There were some good things about the class, namely: 
1) The homework was very preparatory for his tests, and 
2) His tests were relatively easy -- both midterms averaged a B- uncurved. 
What about Zeitlin himself? Well, he doesn't seem like a nice person. I wouldn't ordinarily critique a professor based on his personality, yet it really shows. He gets frustrated whenever anyone asks a question as if he's annoyed that we don't get it. At the same time, he frequently asks for questions! It's confusing...I think that most people in the class became too afraid to ask questions. He generally makes question-askers feel dumb for not understanding something and always talks about how ""easy"" and ""obvious"" the answers are. When reviewing our second midterm, he was legitimately dumbfounded how so many people in the class messed up question 4. Does he expect midterm averages to be 100% or something? In general, I would say Zeitlin is dismissive about student concerns. 
His lectures are essentially carbon-copies of the textbook (including his examples), which can be good or bad depending on your perspective. A significant portion of the class didn't go to lecture knowing that the textbook could provide the same information in a less convoluted manner. If lectures aren't your thing, you'll probably love this class because you can never go and still get decent grades.

 Wonderful teacher! Very sweet and teaches us a lot about French culture in the course. It is not a grammar course, so I wouldn't particularly recommend this class if you need to refine your grammar because that's not really covered in the material. What IS covered in the material, however, is really interesting and fun stuff. The class is definitely participation based, and everyone speaks in class about various subjects such as classes, roommates, clothing, studying abroad, race issues, etc. etc. (we honestly talk about anything and everything!)

Pros: Banu Baydil seems like a nice enough person and seems to care about her students. She is open to students' feedback (for example, if you think the homework assignment should be pushed back or in one case that class should be cancelled) and isn't strict at all -- she even told us she didn't care what we did in class as long as we didn't bother our classmates. She curves the class a lot (according to her, she gives As to 1/3 of the class and Bs to 1/3 to 1/2). 
Cons: She takes a really really long time to return assignments. She isn't a very good lecturer and she uses the book's powerpoints, so if you don't understand the book's way of explaining it you'll have a hard time. That said, I didn't undersand/almost fell asleep most times in class (don't take it at 8:40am!) but by reading the textbook I figured out the material.
If you're looking for a fairly un-rigorous stats class with a pretty easy-going professor, Banu Baydil's class is probably your best bet.

Heather was one of my worst academic experiences at Columbia. Intellectually, I was not impressed. I felt like I was talking to an intellectual equal, whereas my ideal CC professor would have spent years or even decades thinking about the CC texts and drawing profound connections between them.
She's rigid and inflexible when it comes to attendance and due dates--she refuses to extend a deadline even if you explain that you have 2 papers and a final on the same day, and WILL take marks off for late submissions. Apparently, this is supposed to instill self-discipline and help us come to terms with the fact that sometimes, life is hard.
Workload:
Usual CC readings; one long paper (10-15 pages); midterm; final.

I have mixed reviews about this class. Professor Tadiar is without a doubt fantastic - she's super sweet, incredibly knowledgable, a great lecturer and really knows her stuff. This class is also great in that it teaches you to think differently about things. That being said, though, please be warned that this class is hard. The readings are extremely long, dense, and they are difficult concepts. She goes through them the best she can in class but she can't get to all of them and even though she talks about them they can be incredibly confusing. If you slack off in this class you will be sorry. If you want to work really hard and come out with new ""critical perspectives"" and actually learn something, this class is for you. If you don't like doing really long, dense readings and writing difficult papers I wouldn't recommend this class. It can be really daunting at times. 
Workload:
A lot. Weekly readings of at least 100 pgs that you have to put a lot of effort into. 2 reading response papers (first is 4 to 5 pages, second is 5 to 7 pages) that connect concepts across the readings and relate them to a contemporary example. The midterm is what others have said - 8 pages give or take that answer three questions (about two pages per question). The final is a bit daunting - 3 hours and she doesn't give you the questions beforehand and there are a bunch of essays, but at least its open book.

I really don't understand why Jose Antonio doesn't have a silver nugget... the amount of effort he puts into his lectures, his willingness to slow down and answer questions for anyone who asks, and his ability to make two hours go by quickly warrant him a silver a nugget. I took this class a year ago and I am just writing this review in hopes of boosting him. 
That being said, the class is not easy. You basically learn an entire language in one semester which gets harder and harder as the semester moves on. I think there is a bit of a bump right after the midterm where it feels like you haven't learned anything because you're being taught too much and then it gets a little easier again as the semester ends. I would not recommend this class if you are not gifted in learning languages and lack the ability to process them without translating back and forth in English in your head... you need a certain level of aptitude to keep up with the speed of the class otherwise you will find yourself writing a Culpa review full of complaints about the workload.
If you are truly good at romance languages (this does not mean that you must be fluent in hundreds, just that you know the patterns) then this class is not bad at all. I think I could have probably put a little more effort into learning the vocabulary and fully understanding the homework exercises, which might have led to less studying before quizzes and exams, but I still expect to do fine in the class (A-) and I RARELY put more than 3 hours a week for this class. 
Overall I really enjoyed the class. Yes, Jose docks points for absences, lateness and participation, but then again these are EASY points to gain so why not just make the effort to get them? It's the same concept as writing discussion posts for participation. 
Jose Antonio is great about responding quickly to emails, being available during office hours, and returning assignments on time. He really does care about his students and class is actually kind of fun. 
Workload:
The workload is very heavy; the textbook exercises can take hours based on sheer volume, but they are not hard whatsoever and you can 'check' the answers right away. I found the midterm difficult but that was my own fault because I was overly confident and did not study enough. The quizzes are fine if you can construct sentences and have a decent grasp of verb conjugations. The compositions are delightful! They are literally one page double spaced and Jose Antonio gives you an actual list of exactly what he wants in them, PLUS a revision. I think I put the most time and effort into writing these because I knew he was a harsh grader with them so I think thats the trick - just make sure your compositions are spotless (it's not that hard its like three paragraphs)

If you want to learn anything avoid this professor at all costs! He is completely disorganized, does not respond emails and does not show up for office hours.
He gets to class completely unprepared, then he spends around 10 minutes writing in his laptop and when he finally starts the class he shows the students he just came up with some assignment (that he wrote fairly bad in a Google Docs document). Then he spends 40 minutes trying to explain what he wants us to do, but nobody understands because he did not plan the assignment and frequently end up changing the assignment while he tries to explain. 
When it is finally time to start class for real he just starts talking about a topic, but often he gets confused and then decides to open the Wikipedia page of that topic to see if he can solve his confusion.
He nevers go deeper than the Wikipedia page of a given topic, then spends the final minutes of the class basically just listing books and websites we should read for next week. That's right BOOKS. He once suggested we read 3 300 pages long books for the next week. 
Of course nobody reads a single page of that books and the professor doesn't even remember he suggested us to read the books afterwards.
Anyway it is a really depressing course. I registered thinking I would learn something about building scalable systems and Hadoop and stuff. The most advanced thing we learned was the first most basic example of doing a wordcount with Hadoop. That was basically the last assignment as well.
And the final project? Well it is something you will spend dozens of hours but you will only use what you already knew before. Basically building some web app that is hosted on Amazon and uses DynamoDb.
Workload:
Homeworks everyweek. The professor just comes up with them on the fly. The can be quite laborious since he doesn't think before asking, but you won't actually learn anything that matters.
My syggestion, learn to use Amazon services by yourself. You will do it anyway, in class or out of class.

Birol Emir is really not so bad. Intro Stats had very little work when I took it with him and he's quite droll. That being said, his day job is Pfizer and he commutes in from Connecticur, so his focus is not teaching or even academia. 
Do the readings, do the problem sets, grin and bear it. Intro Stats is not the type of class to always be revelatory.

Professor Balsam is a wonderful, sweet man.  While certainly not perfect at teaching, he is one of the most approachable and nice professors I have ever encountered.  I'll admit, his lectures can be sometimes be incredibly boring and dry, but his unique sense of humor is what usually kept me going throughout class.  He is very caring about his students and is always available for help or if you just want to meet with him about your grade.  He is also incredibly resourceful...to those Psychology and Neuroscience majors out there, go to him if you are looking for labs, he will definitely hook you up with a fantastic lab at either Barnard, Columbia, or the Columbia Medical Center.  
The course is not difficult at all and the material can sometimes be very interesting.  Go to lecture and take notes, but in order to do well on his tests, do his study questions that he posts and read the book (and actually READ it).  The book is heavy at times, but you have to put in the work to get the grade you want.  Overall, a perfectly manageable class.
Workload:
Two midterms, a final (not cumulative), and some mini homework assignments sprinkled here and there that are super easy and are basically free points.

I want to start by saying while I loathe going to this class, there's a student I have another class with that loves it. The student plans on going into medieval archaeology though so that may have something to do with it. I love history, but with this class I've discovered that medieval history isn't for me. 
Part of my dislike of this class was his style of teaching. He would often teach by subject (late Roman Empire, Monasticism, sub-Roman successor states) instead of in chronological order. I'm sure a lot of people like that, but I find it difficult to establish a firm timeline. He rarely covers all the material that he plans to for each lecture, the end result being that he tends to rush through subjects a lot. 
When he asks questions, you better be able to answer in less than five words if he calls on you as he's prone to cut you off and explain the answer. That said, he's not rude if you're wrong; he just says ""I don't think so"" or ""It didn't happen quite like that."" He tries to keep a motivated, energetic demeanor, but I found his lectures to be painfully boring. He frequently references how loud he is, but I sit in the front row for every lecture and often fail to hear him.
Of note is when he showed up to the midterm fifteen minutes late; his solution was to give us an extra fifteen minutes, which is kind of dumb when you realize that there are only fifteen minutes between classes. I was fortunate to have an understanding professor in my next class, but that just seems unprofessional to me.  
Onto the TA, Ethan. He's socially awkward (he laughs when he's nervous, which is to say that he laughs all of the time during section). He isn't very good at facilitating a conversation, so it was mostly me and one other student speaking about 90% of the time. I tried not answering, but the awkward silences were usually too much to bear after ten or fifteen seconds.
While the class as a whole was merely annoying to me for most of the semester, the term paper has left me infuriated. For the love of all that is holy: pick your own primary source! I can NOT stress that enough. I asked the TA for a suggestion concerning military history. What I got instead was a source that was roughly eleven pages of history (military and otherwise) and fifty pages of a sermon detailing the numerous, often unspecified, failings of various church and secular leaders. I'm not even shitting you when I say that most of it consisted of quotes from the Bible. If you're into Christianity, that might be your thing...it is not mine. When I sent in a draft for Kosto and Ethan to read, I got vague feedback amounting to ""a clear, well written paper, but there's not enough analysis."" Few tips as to how to actually improve it. I don't mind being told that I'm jacked up, but c'mon, give me some advice as to how to improve.
Overall, if you like medieval history you might enjoy this class, but if you're just looking to satisfy the humanities portion of the lit/hum requirement, or take an elective, avoid this class like the Justinian plague.
P.S. 
While TAs can be great, if Ethan is the TA when you attend, just skip him and go to Kosto; he'll eventually refer you to Kosto anyway when he can't answer your questions.        
Workload:
Not bad:
-One historical puzzle that is graded in terms of your aptitude for analysis, not actual historical accuracy (I don't think anyone got the chronological order correct).
-One three page paper on a secondary source.
-Midterm wasn't too bad; except for note reviews at the end of every day we had class, I really only studied for about three hours the night before and pulled a B+.
-One 2,500 word term paper that can be a pain if you don't pick a source that you're comfortable with.

The topic of the course is extremely interesting and it was the class i was looking forward to the most this semester. Now it is the class I dread the most. It is incredible how an interesting class can be ruined so easily by a terrible professor.
She is very disorganized and not at all cohesive. I feel like I work so much and barely learn anything. She is not good at explaining the overall arching topic/goal she tries to present. You can tell she barely plans what she is going to say the day before… or maybe she does not even plan it. This causes her to be EXTREMELY unclear. She jumps back and forth during lecture and it is almost impossible to keep up with what she is talking about. You never know what year she is talking about, what author she is talking about. There is no order to her lectures and you either get really confused or you start dozing off. She could use some kind of presentation that could keep her on track and help students understand what she is trying to get at. 
Also, she created the midterm the day before the midterm. I know this because the last class before the test she said she had not created it yet. She just told us the sort of things she might put on the test. Point is, she did not plan out the midterm well and it was not thought out. It was super writing heavy over a very short period of time. The next class she apologized for having made it so complicated for a 1.5 hr test and thankfully gave us extra credit options.
She changes the syllabus as you go through but is not good at explaining her changes. No matter how much attention you pay you are never 100% clear with what is to be done for next week.
I do not recommend it at all.

Workload:
The workload is impossible. Completely inhuman. You have to read and do a 2-3 short essays, but the amount of reading is ridiculous. It isn't the kind of class you can survive without reading. YOU HAVE TO READ to pass the class. I divided the reading with three other people and it is a lot.
