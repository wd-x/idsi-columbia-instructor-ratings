Very light work load. Workbook pages for daily hw that he usually never takes up, quizzes (each worth only 1% so no pressure at all), an essay, 2 oral presentations, a midterm and a final.

I could see how some people don't like Professor Kasara.  But at the same time haters gon hate.
This class could be amazing for certain kinds of people and terrible for others.  It really depends on how you learn.  As someone who has a very hard time learning from textbooks, and rather pays extremely close attention to lectures and slides, I have enjoyed this class.  Having read practically nothing I feel like I've learned so much more than in any other polisci class at Columbia and am expecting an A- overall.  She's a decent lecturer and has really comprehensive slides that she posts on courseworks that really tell 90% of what you need to know. 
That being said this class is not for some types of learners.  There are the people in class that read everything and either don't come to lecture or don't pay attention once they get there.  If this is you YOU SHOULD NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.  With professor Kasara these are the people that never seem to know what's going on and get bad grades on the exams (and I suspect the people below who thought the course was confusing).
In terms of personality, Professor Kasara can be subtly hilarious in lecture (if you pay attention), but I can also see why some people could think she's a jerk.  Like she'll make jokes throughout lecture, but also swear heavily at you if you don't put your pen down at time in an exam.  If you raise your hand once or twice she'll learn your name and affably tolerate your puny existence. Just don't piss her off personally and you'll be fine.
Workload:
100-200 pages of dense reading a week you don't have to/maybe shouldn't even do
3 exams, noncumulative, all in class
1 final paper of 6-8 pages
weekly handouts depending on your TA
Either Kasara's relaxed since these other reviewers took her class or people are overdramatic whiners.  This class wasn't easy but it wasn't the gauntlet it's made out to be.

As a non-science major who put in effort for the course, I found it more difficult than I had expected it to be.
Prof. Honisch is a nice lady who is quick and willing to entertain questions, as are her TAs. Unfortunately, with little backgrounding in science and oceanography, I found the lectures often hard to follow (8:40am start time does not help). Some of the powerpoint slides, which are essential to the course, were a bit disorganised and questions on the homework and exams were often confusing.
If a non-science major made it to office hours often, he/she could probably scrape a decent grade in this class. But it is far from an easy A if you don't have background.

The class was basically a walkthrough of AWS. By the end you will have seen a bunch of different AWS services and this is kind of interesting but it should be approached as a teach-yourself-as-you-go type of class.
Professor Sahu is an ineffective lecturer. He does provide a list of interesting papers to read, and recommends several other readings which are good, but I took away almost nothing from his lectures. I would recommend never showing up on time because nothing ever happens in the first 20 or so minutes. Additionally he missed several lectures, and had other guest lectures where clearly he had dropped it on the person at the last minute. I got the impression he had a lot of other things going on and this class was not his priority. 
 
Workload:
7 or 8 reading summaries, a 3-part project that extends over the course of the semester, a final project where you design and deploy your own app. You can kind of decide how far you want to take things so the project size can vary. The one good thing about how disorganized Professor Sahu is, is that the workload would probably be worse if he got his act together.

You'll spend half of the class learning Java, which is pretty easy if you put time into it. The other half is more theoretical, though it shouldn't be a big problem if you're competent in math.
The workload is manageable. Again, the amount of time you'll spend outside of class studying and working on the problem sets really depends on 1) your aptitude in math, which many CC/GS kids - I'm sorry to say - lack, but more importantly, 2) how much you enjoy CS and learning about algorithmic thinking and problem solving. If you fit into both categories, you'll breeze through this class; if you're merely good at math but spend no time studying, you can expect to get a B-/B, and if you're not so good at math but really enjoy the subject or spend a shit ton of time studying, you can probably walk out with at least an A-.

I was in the same situation as the review below - after scouring CULPA and finding horrible, horrible reviews on Prof. Springs, I tried my hardest to get out of the class, and didn't succeed. Now that it's the end of the semester, I can safely say that this was one of my favorite classes this semester. Prof. Springs is very knowledgeable and so very willing to help out students any way she can. The only time I saw that she used her iPad during class was when she was taking attendance from it. Although I may be mistaken, I do not believe she was ever disengaged because of it. She always responded promptly to my emails, and was always available during office hours. In my opinion, she was a pretty great professor!

What you'd expect. Two papers and a podcast, which she said was new to the syllabus. No midterm or final.

I was really excited going into this classâ€”I'm a huge fan of graphic novels and think it's important that they be viewed as serious literature. This class left such a bad taste in my mouth, though. This class is not an engaging look at the history of graphic novels or a study of the development of the medium. You are literally just given a list of graphic novels on the syllabus to read and the lectures are a string of random anecdotes about them. There is a lot of breadth, but absolutely no depth. All of the assignments are vague and have nothing to do with the lectures, and are just given for the sake of having assignments. They try to run the lecture like a seminar, and what happens is that the same five people talk the whole class and the other students are given nothing to work with. There is also literally a ""race week"" and a ""gender week"" and the way the professors approached these subjects is stale and antiquated. 
What made the entire experience worse, though, was that the professors were not open at all to criticism. They wanted our feedback the last day, but spent the whole time justifying their decisions instead of considering the fact that their refusing to plan their lectures or write assignments comes off as lazy and disrespectful of our time. They also told us they didn't want to approach the texts from critical perspectives since they wanted to ""present a buffet"" of works for us to read instead. This class is a survey in the most basic sense, and you could get more out of reading the books on your own then sitting through the painful, shallow lectures. It was also infuriating how strictly the papers were graded when we were given so little to work with. 
This class was not only disrespectful to the students investing time in it, but disrespectful to the medium itself. It's been fighting for years to be accepted as a legitimate literature in the academy, and this class hurts the progress it has made in the past decades.

Alice is not for the faint of heart. As an adviser, she is a lovely combination of sassy and nurturing, and eager to discuss her craft with you. Students who make an effort to ask questions about their directing projects, put in thoughtful effort, and meet with her one-on-one also get to see this side of her. In class, however, she does not suffer fools, and doesn't hold back criticism for late papers and underprepared scene presentations. You will want to work, whether you like directing or not, because if you don't put in a solid effort for each of her assignments, she'll call you out in front of the class - especially early in the semester. If you're particularly sensitive to criticism, this can seem sadistic, but it is her way of creating a classroom climate where nobody wastes anyone else's time, and you come to appreciate that. 
She is good at teaching how to make pretty and effective stage pictures through composition techniques. She uses her own Viewpoints training frequently as a director, which is interesting for actors trained in the discipline. She does her best to teach ""how to interact with actors,"" but takes a kind of trial-by-fire approach - ""you just have to figure out what language each actor speaks and use it in rehearsal"" - that does little to decrease the stress of rehearsing your grade-defining final project. 
Your experience of this course's workload will depend on what play Alice picks for the final scenes. This semester, it was Clybourne Park. Everyone had to do a scene from it, whether they liked the play or not. 
I'd recommend taking a class with Alice - she's got a lot to teach about life and power and art as a tool for representation - but steel yourself for criticism and bring your best to every class. 
Workload:
Little assignments for every class: text-based analysis, reading a few pages, presenting a stage tableau with a few other members of the class, etc. A few required events outside of class, like a designers giving talks and the two -per-semester Department shows. Two short response papers/reviews of the Department shows. Pop quizzes on reading, which she warns/darkly hints about. Two presentations of the same scene, graded by how well you take and integrate criticism into your final scene. A 15-25 page directing portfolio explaining the play from which your scene is drawn, but some of those pages can be visual research, so don't stress about how much writing it will be. This class will require preparation and attendance every day, or you'll fall behind.

How do I love Jeremy? Let me count the ways: he only assigns the most necessary chapters. Though he lets discussion go where it will and keeps the class pretty flexible, his lectures are well prepared and he makes sure he knows his stuff (though he made it clear on the first day that he was NOT a professor and NOT in expert in anything except Nietzsche maybe sort of). He prefaces each philosopher with a funny story. He's fine with fast-and-loose weekly responses even if they're ranty. He brought us jellybeans once. He sends long in-depth emails. On papers he gives LOTS of feedback and makes sure to comment on the things we did well. He is a fair grader. He has a sense of humor. He makes sure everyone gets to talk, and the class feels like a very safe space to have opinions. He devoted an entire class to Ferguson and came equipped with a hefty pile of police violence and mass-incarceration statistics to refocus the discussion when it strayed. He showed us Philosopher Football in class. Knowing that he is always stressed out about his dissertation and is basically a malnourished grad student with chronic migraines made it all the more impressive that he brought as much attention and care to this class as he did. He's the nicest guy and I feel like I learned a lot this semester.
Workload:
Weekly email responses. Very relaxed. Allows extensions on papers, in fact often extended deadlines regardless. Take-home midterm (which I think was not what he usually does), in-class final. Very understanding about student workload, also understanding about needing to leave/miss class, though nobody abused that.

CONS:
Professor Gaifman may be a brilliant man, but he does not belong at the front of a classroom. I'm still not sure what his intentions were with this course, despite coming in with an open mind and excitement to learn more philosophy. He can also be remarkably cruel, and all but oblivious to student concerns and input. He made probability-which should be tremendously useful and insightful-a depressing subject to learn this semester.
Assignments were extremely vague and unclear due to Gaifman's unique and somewhat esoteric notation. Even when much of the class was unable to interpret certain questions, he only provided stubborn retorts such as ""THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR"" and entirely refused to compromise on what we all believed to be reasonable concerns. His grading method was a mystery, with many points deducted from assignments but zero markings or feedback given. Because the assignments were so obscure, most of the answers given by myself and others were only discovered via Google.
Why is this required for the Econ-Phil major? With statistics and symbolic logic already on the major requirements, this class is not very useful. I would have much rather preferred a course in the history or philosophical foundations of economics. Reading Smith, Marx, Mill, etc. would have been immensely more beneficial than listening to Gaifman's incomprehensible ramblings about abstract probability axioms. Oh well, I suppose I should be used to Columbia wasting my time and money by now.
Also, the fact that he showed up late to EVERY lecture, and proceeded to scold other students for being late was particularly enraging.
PROS:
Good team building among classmates due to traumatic nature of the lectures and assignments.

Dani (as she likes to be called) makes this class a lot more enjoyable and a lot less painful than it could be given the workload (see below...). She really wants you to succeed, though the quizzes at times may make you feel otherwise. Overall, I was expecting to hate this class given all the hype and it ended up being one of my best experiences at Columbia. Granted, as a postbac I had more time to attend OHs, work on lab reports, etc. I can see how as an undergrad with 5+ classes it could be a nightmare. The bottom line is, this class is much more work than you would expect from a 3 credit course, but you also get a lot more out of it than say, bio lab. If you prepare your schedule accordingly, you will be fine. Also, I cannot stress this enough, go to OH! It will save you a lot of time sitting at home spinning your wheels and probably ending up with the wrong answer. As for the mythical quizzes, if you do the practice problems, review your notes, and stay calm, you will be fine. The means are usually fairly low (~10/20). 
Workload:
4 lab reports (averaged ~15-20 hours each, but for some of them you have 2+ weeks so budget your time accordingly and make sure to leave time to attend OH). 8 regular quizzes and 1 final quiz. Notebook pages for every lab that take 1-3 hours each.

The course has changed drastically since the last review as Prof Stockwell has implemented a ""flipped classroom."" Although this means more day to day work (hwk quizzes, in-class questions, team problems), I feel that it has drastically improved the course. I thought biochem was going to be an agonizingly detailed look at mechanisms, but was pleasantly surprised when the material was relatively conceptual and brain-teaserish at times. The only downside is that there is no curve, but the drop policy is fairly generous so an A range grade is very doable.

Very intelligent teacher. If you are into discussing those books (which I am not) he is your guy. He doesn't force you to participate in class. I would say the only bad part about him is that he does not stop talking from the time the class begins to when it ends so I sleep at least a little every class. If you read, you will definitely succeed in his class. Great prof!

I never write CULPA reviews but this course is too good to pass up. I'm sitting here, grieving over a tedious take home final for this course, but I've truly never been so inspired by a course. Professor Berman is extremely well versed in her field and, unlike other brilliant professors, is equally as good at communicating her knowledge. If you take this class GO TO LECTURE. Without Berman's lectures I would not have walked away from this class with the fully developed picture of the history of Europe that I have now.

Professor Salanie creates questions for problem sets and exams that can not be solved through the use of the textbook that has been assigned. This would not be so great of a problem if he was able to clearly articulate the material during lectures, but instead he uses circular reasoning to come to questionable solutions (if he ever does reach a conclusion). He is very difficult to follow and does not appear to come in to class with any specific plan of what he wishes to express, which would explain why he often goes off on tangents and rarely defines even the most basic of concepts. Although Principles is apparently supposed to teach us the basics of economic theory, the class taught by Salanie is entirely based off of math and its applications, which is very difficult for those of us who have no background in economics which would allow us to understand the underlying concepts. Essentially, the only people who do not seem to be having extreme difficulty with the course are those who have already taken both macroeconomics and microeconomics courses already. 
The TAs are extremely competent, and fully responsible for saving my grade. Because the textbook is so far from the material that we are tested on, the only useful resource for the class are the TAs.
Workload:
11 problem sets (10 of which count towards final grade) which the TA's occasionally have difficulty solving/ determining what is being asked.
