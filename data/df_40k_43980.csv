I'm echoing everything that the previous reviewer said.  The only reason I ended up sticking with the class was because I needed to take a political science colloquium and I wasn't able to switch out. NEVER NEVER NEVER take anything with this professor.  He's totally incompetent, unprofessional and his grading really is all over the place.  The syllabus is terrible - The readings are insanely long (to the point where nobody ever finishes them) and the discussions are even worse.  Also my worst experience at Columbia.  I felt like my insane tuition money was a complete waste that semester.  It's an unengaging, frustrating class in which you will inevitably be stressed about grading (because he's so vague and all over the place) and won't learn anything other than Columbia is a self-interested institution that doesn't care about students and that there is only luck to thank when you find a good professor.  See! Cynicism.  Avoid this class.
Workload:
Insanely long readings that are not important to do, a few discussion papers, and a 30 page research paper.

Wow. I don't know if Chem Lab changed radically over the past year or so, but I definitely didn't take the same class as those who gave it raving reviews, claiming they learned so much. I spoke to a lot of the people in my lab last semester as well and they agreed -- there was little to nothing redeeming about this course. It's designed so you feel like you're constantly thrown into its vicious, tedious cycle week after week and makes the semester drag on and on. Even as somebody who received an A in the class (it's not hard to), it felt like a COMPLETE waste of time doing so.
So. The vicious cycle: 
1) Go to lab lecture, which is basically just Sarah talking about stuff you've probably learned or will learn in General Chemistry. Be forced to ""work with the people around you"" in an attempt to make it engaging (it's not). Take a 15 minute quiz that, half the time will have a 70% average. Watch points get deducted over the most anal errors, thus making you feel like you're absolutely awful at chemistry (you're not that bad, stay strong, friend). 
2) They take attendance at the end, so guess what? You're not getting out of lecture. 
3) Go to lab. 3-4 hours of pain, depending on if Hansen wants to tack on EXTRA labs/lab stuff to make her class seem more legitimate and less like a high school chemistry lab. The room has poor air circulation, but somehow it's always a bit nippy, and the TAs are half snarky, half nice. Once you finish (YAYYYYY!) you get out of Havemeyer, your spirits raised... until you realize you have to do it again... but only after... 
4) Completing pre-lab (the most USELESS assignment ever, designed to force you to thoroughly read and copy down all the lab instructions... that have been altered by Hansen... and compare that to what's in the actual manual and write them all down). 
5) Completing report sheets, that you will inevitably lose points on somewhere. 
6) Dry lab! Because your time in the lab wasn't enough to convince you guys this class is taken [way too] seriously. 
7) Writing assignments. (...really?) 
8) Repeat for the next few months. 
I'd like to point out, all the work would be 100% fine in my books if it felt like it was reinforcing something, or clarifying my understanding of chemistry. But nope! It just felt like my time was getting sucked away from other classes and into this. I don't know what Hansen thinks, but this class is NOT her students' only class (nor, based on the conversations I've had with many, remotely close to their favorite). 
Prepare to have a sense of ""Ughhh, not again..."" overwhelm you each week.

I don't agree with the negativity from the last post. I was in the very same class and contributed to discussion with regularity. Though the conversation was occasionally run by one side of the classroom, Yvonne's effect on class discussion was  effective. She frequently tried to rearrange the class dynamic through fun group exercises that did create an atmosphere conducive to learning. Moreover, she always looked to advance class discussion beyond the surface of the text. Usually, the class just didn't want to go there. Yvonne looked to inspire those that wanted to learn and was less concerned with those that would just Sparknote the books and show up to class because they had to, which in my mind separates the bulls from the steers. Yvonne was a boss. If you want a good LitHum professor who rewards you for critical thinking and actually reading the text, give her a shot.
Workload:
Same as every LitHum class ever. Manageable. Just do as much of the readings as you can and you will survive. Kiss ass and you will kick ass.

It's impossible for Hansen to  possibly be any more in love with (as mentioned in another r view) her ""creation!"" She acts like it's everybody's only class, assigning ungodly amounts of work (useless, busy work) and expecting victims to treat chem lab like a part time job. You get out of lab just to be thrown into more lab work. 
Maybe if this class were not so redundant people would see the value in it.
Workload:
Heavy. Prelabs are frustratingly, pointlessly lengthy. Report sheets and dry labs are frustratingly repeatative. Midterm and final are alright in my book.
You can easily get an A, but don't expect to have learned much and be prepared to tear hair out in sheer... Frustration over having to do such pointlessness.

This class is and probably will remain a huge dissapointment. My recommendation which seems to be pretty popular is simply do not take this class. This was the first big lecture class I took where the professor held discussion section during class time. Which makes me wonder how she feels about collecting a paycheck when she barely shows up. I guess it's an added bonus of having tenure. By just reading her book and her wiki page you will know more about global cities then sitting through one of her long and disjointed lectures. 
Basically her teaching style is unorganized and lazy. Even with it being an easy A class, I don't think it's worth the time or money. Interesting topic but poor poor delivery! 
Workload:
Four page essays, 2 questions for the midterm and final. Both worth 50%. Readings are doable. Workload is easy.

The class moves pretty slowly for a 4000 level CS class and covers the qualitative components of Computer Science (planning, group dynamics, etc). Don't let the name fool you, there is nothing ""advanced"" about this course. It is interesting that we get to work on a project of our choosing over the course of the semester, but the amount of documentation we have to provide beforehand is a little infuriating. You end up spending 3x more time writing out requirements, risk, etc than writing code. 
You will probably have to take this class because it is required for Software Systems, and let me say that this is not a ""bad"" class. You still learn concepts like design patterns, but ultimately you will learn MUCH more if you take a class like Operating Systems or Computer Networks.

She is young and very friendly. Because of the fun atmosphere of this class I look forward to it, even though the content can be confusing at times. Maria does a good job of making the lessons relatively clear and straight-forward, yet is not very good at keeping the class on track. There are a few distractions and off-topic discussions each class, but they usually pertain to greek culture or stem from that at least.
She could definitely do a better job at explaining some grammar. If you are 100% new to modern greek grammar I would recommend looking up an online guide or using youtube videos to help you understand because it can be easy to get lost.
Workload:
Light workload. Homework assigned for every class but does not take too long. In the beginning of the semester it can take an hour or two if you are adjusting to the language and the alphabet, but once you get the hang of it homework should not take you longer than an hour for each lesson.
